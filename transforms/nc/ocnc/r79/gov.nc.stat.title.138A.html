                    re-recodified chapters, the Revisor of Statutes shall revert the changes made by the Revisor pursuant to Section 3 of S.L. 2017-6, except that after consultation with the appropriate agency staff, the Revisor may separate subsections
                    of statutory sections that existed in the former Chapters into new sections and, when necessary to organize relevant law into its proper place in the re-recodified chapters, may rearrange sentences that appeared within those subsections.
                    The Revisor shall also incorporate into the re-recodified chapters all amendments to Chapters 163, 163A, 138A, and 120C that became effective on or after April 25, 2017, other than those made by S.L. 2017-6 or by Part VIII of S.L.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - This section was recodified as now former G.S. 163A-150 by Session Laws 2017-6, s. 3. Former G.S. 163A-150 was then re-recodified as this section by Session Laws 2018-146, s. 3.1(a), effective January 31, 2019. The historical
                    citation from the former section has been added to this section as re-recodified.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2016-125, ss. 1 and 2, 4th Ex Sess., similarly recodified Chapters 120C, 138A, and 163 in a new Chapter. That new Chapter was designated as <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138B</a></cite>,
                    and headings for new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138B</a></cite>, Subchapter I, and Article 1 were enacted, along with new sections designated as G.S. 138B-1 through 138B-6. Due
                    to a constitutional challenge to the provisions of Session Laws 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., the recodification was stayed and never went into effect. Session Laws 2017-6, s. 2, repealed Part I of 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., among which were
                    the recodifying provisions in ss. 1 and 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2006-201, s. 25, made this Chapter effective October 1, 2006, and applicable to covered persons and legislative employees, to gifts received, to acts and conflicts of interest that arise, and to offenses committed, on or after January 1,
                    2007. Prosecutions for offenses or ethics violations committed before January 1, 2007, are not abated or affected by this act, and the statutes that would be applicable but for this act remain applicable to those prosecutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The preamble to Session Laws 2006-201 reads as follows: "Whereas, the people of North Carolina entrust public power to elected and appointed officials for the purpose of furthering the public, not private or personal, interest; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, to maintain the public trust, it is essential that government function honestly and fairly, free from all forms of impropriety, threats, favoritism, and undue influence; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, elected and appointed officials must maintain and exercise the highest standards of duty to the public in carrying out the responsibilities and functions of their positions; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, acceptance of authority granted by the people to elected and appointed officials imposes a commitment of fidelity to the public interest, and the power so entrusted should not be used to advance narrow interests for oneself or others; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, self-interest, partiality, and prejudice have no place in decisionmaking for the public good; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, public officials must exercise their duties responsibly with skillful judgment and energetic dedication; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, public officials must exercise discretion with sensitive information pertaining to public and private persons and activities; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, to maintain the integrity of North Carolina's State government, those citizens entrusted with authority must exercise it for the good of the public and treat every citizen with courtesy, attentiveness, and respect; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, because many public officials serve on a part-time basis, it is inevitable that conflicts of interest and appearances of conflicts will occur. Often these conflicts are unintentional and slight, but at every turn those public officials who represent
                    the people of this State must ensure that it is the interests of the people, and not their own, that are being served. Officials should be prepared to remove themselves immediately from decisions, votes, or processes where a conflict
                    of interest exists;
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Now, therefore, The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2006-201, s. 22, provides: "The authority, powers, duties and functions, records, personnel, property, unexpended balances of appropriations, allocations, or other funds, including the functions of budgeting and purchasing, of the North Carolina
                    Board of Ethics of the Office of the Governor are transferred to the State Ethics Commission created in Section 1 of this act. The Director of the Budget shall resolve any disputes arising out of this transfer."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2006-201, s. 23(a), provides: "(a) Persons holding covered positions on January 1, 2007, shall file statements of economic interest under Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 138A</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes by March 15, 2007."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2006-201, s. 23(b), as amended by Session Laws 2007-347, s. 16, provides: "Public servants holding positions on January 1, 2007, shall participate in ethics education presentations under G.S. 138A-14 and lobbying education programs under

                    The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure that elected and appointed State agency officials exercise their authority honestly and fairly, free from impropriety, threats, favoritism, and undue influence. To this end, it is the intent of the General Assembly
                    in this Chapter to ensure that standards of ethical conduct and standards regarding conflicts of interest are clearly established for elected and appointed State agency officials, that the State continually educates these officials
                    on matters of ethical conduct and conflicts of interest, that potential and actual conflicts of interests are identified and resolved, and that violations of standards of ethical conduct and conflicts of interest are investigated and
                    properly addressed.

       by Giving the Governor Increased Control Over the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement.
      </b> - Session Laws 2018-2, s. 8(a), provides: "The General Assembly finds that the legislative intent in the enactment of S.L. 2017-6 and establishment of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement was to
                    continue the practice of having an independent, quasi-judicial body for elections and ethics enforcement for the State and consolidate those bodies under a single entity. The General Assembly finds that the entity enforcing these laws
                    must have sufficient distance from political interference due to the potential for abuse of oversight of elections and ethics investigations for partisan purposes. The General Assembly further finds that appointment of a State Board
                    member who is not affiliated with the two largest political parties will foster nonpartisan decision-making by the State Board. As such, by amending the section of the General Statutes establishing the membership of the State Board
                    enacted in S.L. 2017-6, the purpose of this legislation is to implement the decision of the North Carolina Supreme Court on January 26, 2018, in

                    to a constitutional challenge to the provisions of Session Laws 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., the recodification was stayed and never went into effect. Session Laws 2017-6, s. 2, repealed Part I of 2016-125, 4th Ex Sess., among which were

                <p>
                    The purpose of disclosure of the financial and personal interests by covered persons is to assist covered persons and those who appoint, elect, hire, supervise, or advise them identify and avoid conflicts of interest and potential conflicts of interest
                    between the covered person's private interests and the covered person's public duties. It is critical to this process that current and prospective covered persons examine, evaluate, and disclose those personal and financial interests
                    that could be or cause a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest between the covered person's private interests and the covered person's public duties. Covered persons must take an active, thorough, and conscientious
                    role in the disclosure and review process, including having a complete knowledge of how the covered person's public position or duties might impact the covered person's private interests. Covered persons have an affirmative duty to
                    provide any and all information that a reasonable person would conclude is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Chapter and to fully disclose any conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest between the covered person's
                    public and private interests, but the disclosure, review, and evaluation process is not intended to result in the disclosure of unnecessary or irrelevant personal information.
