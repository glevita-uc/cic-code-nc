The purpose of the review and analysis is to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of State government and to identify specific strategies for making State government more efficient and effective. The review and analysis may examine entire departments, agencies, institutions, or similar programs in different departments. The review and analysis shall include an examination of the efficiency and effectiveness of major management policies, practices, and functions pertaining to the following areas:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The statutory authority, funding sources, and functions of each department, agency, institution, or program.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The organizational structure and staffing patterns in place to perform these functions and whether they are appropriate based on comparative data and other reasonable staffing criteria.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The measurement of each reviewed program's outcomes, overall performance, and success in accomplishing its mandated or stated mission and subsequent goals, considering the resources provided to the program.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) State and local responsibilities for providing government services and funding for those services, and whether these responsibilities should be reallocated.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) Personnel systems operations and management.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) State purchasing operations and management.

     <p>
      "(7) Information technology and telecommunications systems policy, organization, and management.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8) The identification of opportunities to reduce fragmentation, duplication, and related or overlapping services or activities through restructuring of departmental organizations and streamlining programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) All executive branch departments, agencies, boards, commissions, authorities, and institutions in the executive branch of State government, including receipt-supported agencies, and all non-State entities receiving State funds shall be subject to review and analysis. The chief administrative officer of each entity shall ensure full cooperation with the Office of State Budget and Management and provide timely responses to the Office of State Budget and Management's request for information under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143C.html#t143Ca02s143C-2-1ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 143C-2-1(b)</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) The Office of State Budget and Management will work collaboratively with the Office of State Auditor to develop the review, analysis, and findings needed to produce a final report and recommendations to the Governor and General Assembly.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) The contracting provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html" target="_blank">Chapter 143</a></cite> of the General Statutes and related State purchasing and budget regulations do not apply to NC GEAR; however, the Office of State Budget and Management shall report all external contracts for consultants or professional services within 30 days of their execution to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations, the Fiscal Research Division, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e) The Office of State Budget and Management shall submit an interim report of the NC GEAR's analysis, findings, and recommendations to the Governor, the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Fiscal Research Division, and the Program Evaluation Division by February 15, 2014, and a final report by February 15, 2015.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(f) Funds appropriated for NC GEAR shall be used to contract with consultants and other experts and to pay for travel, postage, printing, planning, and other related costs as needed to accomplish the objectives specified for the project. Funds appropriated for the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium for NC GEAR shall not revert at the end of each fiscal year but shall remain available for expenditure for the project."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-360, s. 1.1, provides: "This act shall be known as the 'Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act of 2013.'"
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-360, s. 38.2, provides: "Except for statutory changes or other provisions that clearly indicate an intention to have effects beyond the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium, the textual provisions of this act apply only to funds appropriated for, and activities occurring during, the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium."

       Power to Fire Within Scope of Subsection (c).
   
   - When an agency is transferred to a new department by a "Type II transfer," subsection (b) of this section provides that the management functions of the agency, which includes staffing pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, shall be performed not only under the "supervision" but also the "direction" of the head of the principal department. The power to fire clearly falls within the scope of subsection (c) of this section; therefore, the Secretary of Human Resources had the power to fire the superintendent of a state hospital for the mentally disordered before his six-year term expired, and it was not required that he be dismissed by the State Board of Mental Health. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 115</cite>, 257 S.E.2d 399 (1979).

      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Shift of Power to Fire on Employment Contract.
   
   - The transfer of the power to dismiss from the State Board of Mental Health to the Department of Human Resources makes no change in either the obligations of the parties or the remedies available to plaintiff superintendent of a state hospital for the mentally disordered in enforcing his agreement. Plaintiff's contract of employment was not with the agency which appointed him but with the State, and the essential terms of that contract, namely, duration, dismissal for cause, and salary, remain unaffected by any shift of the power to fire from one agency of the State to another. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 115</cite>, 257 S.E.2d 399 (1979).

       The Governor has the duty to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers.
   
   The constitutional independence of the executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders. In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively derogative of the Governor's constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The General Assembly, in the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.114.html#t114a01s114-2" target="_blank">G.S. 114-2(2)</a></cite>, did not intend to create such potential.

      - Section 18.2 of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, provided: "The President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall request the Supreme Court to issue an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of Sections 5 and 6 of this act and the appointment of the chief hearing officer by the Chief Justice as provided in G.S. 7A-752 in Section 2 of this act."
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 19 of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, provided that sections 5 and 6 of the act, which added G.S. 143A-55.3 through 143A-55.7 and amended G.S. 120-123, should become effective 30 days from the date the Supreme Court issued an advisory opinion on the constitutionality of those sections unless the opinion stated that those sections were unconstitutional, in which event those sections would not become effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, s. 19 of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, provided that the act would expire Jan. 1, 1992, and would not be effective on or after that date. However, Session Laws 1991, c. 103, s. 1 amended Session Laws 1985, c. 746, s. 19 by deleting the January 1, 1992 Sunset Provision.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 19 of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, further provided that the act would not affect contested cases commenced before Jan. 1, 1986.
     </p>
     <p>
      By letter of October 28, 1985, addressed to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, the Supreme Court declined to issue an advisory opinion as contemplated by Session Laws 1985, c. 746, on the grounds that to issue such an opinion would be to place the Court directly in the stream of the legislative process, and in view of the prerogative of the General Assembly to first address and determine the constitutionality of its own legislation. See In re Advisory Opinion, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 679</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 890 (1985).
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 1985 (Reg. Sess., 1986), c. 1022, s. 7 deleted the word "advisory" preceding "opinion" in the third sentence of Session Laws 1985, c. 746, s. 19.
