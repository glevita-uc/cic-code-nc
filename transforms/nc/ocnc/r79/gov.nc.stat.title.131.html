            Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1983, c. 775, s. 3, provides: "Sec. 3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any unit of government, or units of government acting jointly, that as of December 31, 1983, is operating a hospital or hospitals pursuant to Articles
            2 or 2A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131.html" target="_blank">Chapter 131</a></cite> of the General Statutes may continue to operate pursuant to the provisions of those Articles as they existed on December
            31, 1983, to the extent that those Articles are inconsistent with this Chapter. However, a unit of government that has been operating a hospital pursuant to those Articles may choose to continue operations under the provisions of one of the
            Parts of Article 2 of this Chapter by adopting an appropriate resolution and by satisfying all other requirements of the relevant Part of Article 2 of this Chapter."

        </p>
        <p>
            "Section 1. G.S. 131-7, as it applies to hospitals continuing to operate under Article 2, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131.html" target="_blank">Chapter 131</a></cite> of the North Carolina General Statutes pursuant to Section

            and holding an election on the issue of continuing the tax levy shall be the same as the procedure for the petition and election for establishment of the initial tax levy, provided that the requirement that 150 of the 200 petitioners not be
