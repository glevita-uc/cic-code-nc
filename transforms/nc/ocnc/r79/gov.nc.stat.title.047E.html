        <p>
            Disclosure Statement Applies to Land Sales. - Although the seller was required by law to furnish a residential property disclosure statement to buyers at the time of the parties' property sale transaction and did not do so, the trial court properly dismissed
            the buyers' claim for damages pursuant to the Residential Property Disclosure Act, G.S. 47E-1 et seq., as the buyers' sole remedy under the Act was cancellation of the land sale contract; no separate action for damages was permitted under
            the Act for not providing the disclosure statement. Little v. Stogner, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 25, 592 S.E.2d 5 (2004).

            "Whereas, pursuant to S.L. 2011-276, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (now Department of Environmental Quality), in conjunction with the Department of Commerce, the Department of Justice, and the Rural Advancement Foundation (RAFI-USA),
            issued a draft report in March of 2012; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, pursuant to S.L. 2011-276, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (now Department of Environmental Quality) received public comment regarding the draft report, including public comment received at public meetings held on March 20,

        </p>
        <p>
            Whereas, the final report set forth a number of recommendations, including recommendations concerning all of the following:
        </p>
        <p>
            "(1) Development of a modern oil and gas regulatory program, taking into consideration the processes involved in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling technologies, and long-term prevention of physical or economic waste in developing oil and gas
            resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(2) Collection of baseline data for areas near proposed drill sites concerning air quality and emissions, as well as groundwater and surface water resources and quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(3) Requirements that oil and gas operators prepare and have approved water management plans that limit water withdrawals during times of low-flow conditions and droughts.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(4) Enhancements to existing oil and gas well construction standards to address the additional pressures of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(5) Development of setback requirements and identification of areas where oil and gas exploration and development activities should be prohibited.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(6) Development of a State stormwater regulatory program for oil and gas drilling sites.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(7) Development of specific standards for management of oil and gas wastes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(8) Requirements for disclosure of hydraulic fracturing chemicals and constituents to regulatory agencies and the public.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(9) Prohibitions on use of certain chemicals or constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(10) Improvements to data management capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(11) Development of a coordinated permitting program for oil and gas exploration and development activities within the Department of Environment and Natural Resources(now Department of Environmental Quality) where it will benefit from the expertise of
            State geological staff and the ability to coordinate air, land, and water permitting.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(12) Development of protocols to ensure that State agencies, local first responders, and industry are prepared to respond to a well blowout, chemical spill, or other emergency.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(13) Adequate funding for any continued work on the development of a State regulatory program for the natural gas industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(14) Appropriate distribution of revenues from any taxes or fees that may be imposed on oil and gas exploration and development activities to support a modern regulatory program for the management of all aspects of oil and gas exploration and development
            activities using the processes of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the State, and to support local governments impacted by the activities, including, but not limited to, sufficient funding for improvements to and repair of roads
            subject to damage by truck traffic and heavy equipment from these activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(15) Closure of gaps in regulatory authority over the siting, construction, and operation of gathering pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(16) Clarifications needed to address local government regulatory authority over oil and gas exploration and development activities, and use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing for that purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(17) Additional research required on impacts to local governments and local infrastructure, as well as potential economic impacts from oil and gas exploration and development activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(18) Development of provisions to address liability of the oil and gas industry for environmental contamination caused by exploration and development activities, particularly with regard to groundwater contamination.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(19) Establishment of a process that affords additional public participation in connection with development of a modern oil and gas regulatory program; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, the final report also states "[a]fter reviewing other studies and experiences in oil and gas-producing states, DENR has concluded that information available to date suggests that production of natural gas by means of hydraulic fracturing can
            be done safely as long as the right protections are in place"; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, the General Assembly concurs in the conclusion of the final report that hydraulic fracturing can be done safely as long as the right protective measures are in place before any permits for horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing are issued;

        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, it is the intent of the General Assembly to authorize oil and gas exploration and development activities using horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing treatments, but to prohibit the issuance of permits for these activities until such time
            as the General Assembly has determined that a modern regulatory program for the management of oil and gas exploration and development in the State and the use of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing for that purpose has been fully
            established and takes legislative action to allow the issuance of permits; and
        </p>
        <p>
            "Whereas, it is the intent of the General Assembly to establish a modern regulatory program based on the recommendations of the final report and the following principles:

            "(1) Protection of public health and safety.
        </p>

            "(2) Protection of public and private property.
        </p>

            "(4) Promotion of economic development and expanded employment opportunities.

        <p>
            Action for Damages Not Permitted for Failure to Provide Disclosure Statement. - Although the seller was required by law to furnish a residential property disclosure statement to buyers at the time of the parties' property sale transaction disclosing property
            conditions or stating no representations about the conditions were made to the buyers, and did not do so, the trial court properly dismissed the buyers' claim for damages pursuant to the Residential Property Disclosure Act, G.S. 47E-1 et seq.,
            as the buyers' sole remedy under the Act was cancellation of the land sale contract; no separate action for damages was permitted under the Act for not providing the disclosure statement. Little v. Stogner, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>            25, 592 S.E.2d 5 (2004).

     Buyer's Failure to Exercise Reasonable Diligence.
    </b> - Sellers of real property were entitled to summary judgment on the buyer's claims because there was no genuine issue of material fact that the buyer and the buyer's spouse failed to exercise reasonable diligence prior to consummating
            the purchase of a residential property from the sellers. The failure of the buyer to conduct any inspection of the property during the due diligence period or prior to closing, after being notified of potential problems, constituted a failure
            by the buyer to conduct reasonable diligence under the circumstances. Stevens v. Heller, - N.C. App. - , 836 S.E.2d 675 (2019).

            Action for Damages Not Permitted for Failure to Provide Disclosure Statement. - Although the seller was required by law to furnish a residential property disclosure statement to buyers at the time of the parties' property sale transaction disclosing property
            conditions or stating no representations about the conditions were made to the buyers, and did not do so, the trial court properly dismissed the buyers' claim for damages pursuant to the Residential Property Disclosure Act, G.S. 47E-1 et seq.,
            as the buyers' sole remedy under the Act was cancellation of the land sale contract; no separate action for damages was permitted under the Act for not providing the disclosure statement. Little v. Stogner, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite>            25, 592 S.E.2d 5 (2004).

        <p>
            With the exception of the disclosures required by G.S. 47E-4.1, the owner may discharge the duty to disclose imposed by this Chapter by providing a written report attached to the residential property disclosure statement and the owners' association and
            mandatory covenants disclosure statement by a public agency or by an attorney, engineer, land surveyor, geologist, pest control operator, contractor, home inspector or other expert, dealing with matters within the scope of the public agency's
            functions or the expert's license or expertise. The owner shall not be liable for any error, inaccuracy, or omission of any information delivered pursuant to this section if the error, inaccuracy, or omission was made in reasonable reliance
            upon the information provided by the public agency or expert and the owner was not grossly negligent in obtaining the information or transmitting it.
