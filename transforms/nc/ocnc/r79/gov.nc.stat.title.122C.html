       § 122C-2. Policy.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    The policy of the State is to assist individuals with needs for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services in ways consistent with the dignity, rights, and responsibilities of all North Carolina citizens. Within available
                    resources it is the obligation of State and local government to provide mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services through a delivery system designed to meet the needs of clients in the least restrictive,
                    therapeutically most appropriate setting available and to maximize their quality of life. It is further the obligation of State and local government to provide community-based services when such services are appropriate, unopposed
                    by the affected individuals, and can be reasonably accommodated within available resources and taking into account the needs of other persons for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    State and local governments shall develop and maintain a unified system of services centered in area authorities or county programs. The public service system will strive to provide a continuum of services for clients while considering the availability
                    of services in the private sector. Within available resources, State and local government shall ensure that the following core services are available:

                <p>
                    Within available resources, the State shall provide funding to support services to targeted populations, except that the State and counties shall provide matching funds for entitlement program services as required by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As used in this Chapter, the phrase "within available resources" means State funds appropriated and non-State funds and other resources appropriated, allocated or otherwise made available for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse
                    services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The furnishing of services to implement the policy of this section requires the cooperation and financial assistance of counties, the State, and the federal government.

                    are appropriated for the specific programs established by this act. Funds appropriated for the 1990-91 fiscal year or for any year in the future do not constitute any entitlement to services beyond those provided for that fiscal year.

                        Court Could Not Declare Subdivision Unconstitutional Nunc Pro Tunc. - Where the trial court concluded the case or controversy by finding the respondent not mentally ill pursuant to this section, it lacked jurisdiction to subsequently (six months later)
                        declare nunc pro tunc that subdivision (21)(ii) was unconstitutional. In re Lynette H., <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 598</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 272 (1988).

                        Effect of 1985 Amendment. - When the legislature in 1985, deleted the term "recent past" and substituted the term "relevant past," the Court of Appeals construed this legislative amendment as an effort on the part of the legislature to clarify the meaning
                        of the statute, not to change the law. Davis v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 465 S.E.2d 2 (1995).

                        Statutory language establishes a two-prong test for dangerousness to self. The first prong addresses self-care ability regarding one's daily affairs. The second prong, which also must be satisfied for involuntary commitment to result, mandates a specific
                        finding of a probability of serious physical debilitation resulting from the more general finding of lack of self-caring ability. In re Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 270 S.E.2d 537

                        Trial court must find three elements present in order to find that respondent is dangerous to others: (1) within the recent past (2) respondent has (a) inflicted serious bodily harm on another, or (b) attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another,
                        or (c) threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another, or (d) has acted in such a manner as to create a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another, and (3) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will
                        be repeated. In re Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980).

                        Trial Court Found Appellant Dangerous to Themselves. - Trial court properly found that a complainant, whom the court recommitted for inpatient treatment, was a danger to the complainant because there was a reasonable possibility that the complainant would
                        have suffered serious physical debilitation in the near future. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 37, 758 S.E.2d 33 (2014).

                        The trial court correctly found the appellant "dangerous to others," under this section and G.S. 122C-276.1, in spite of the appellant's objection that murders which happened 10 years in the past should not be considered because of their "remoteness,"
                        where, from both evidentiary and medical perspectives, the nature of his crimes was more important than their timing, and where the court's findings on his dangerousness were also rooted in additional evidence unrelated to his
                        prior crimes, including (1) his past and present mental illness, (2) his behavior since July 17, 1988 (including "slaw incident" during which he became upset and angry with his job supervisor over his co-worker's premature disposal
                        of coleslaw from the hospital grill where he was employed), and (3) his high likelihood of post-release relapse into multi-substance abuse, which all experts agreed was a trigger for his 1988 psychosis during which he killed four
                        people and wounded several others. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 532 S.E.2d 553 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Record supported trial court's judgment that defendant who was acquitted of multiple homicides by reason of insanity and was committed to a mental hospital did not meet his burden of proving he no longer had a mental illness and was not dangerous. In
                        re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 564 S.E.2d 305 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Present statutory definition of "dangerous to others" does not require a finding of overt acts. In re Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence was competent to support the trial court's conclusions that respondent was mentally ill and dangerous to himself within the statutory definitions of those terms. In re Lowery, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite>                        67, 428 S.E.2d 861 (1993).

                    <p>
                        "Recent Past" Same as "Relevant Past." - The Court of Appeals construed the term "recent past" to mean "relevant past"; as such, violent acts committed by mental patient within the six months prior to the district court hearing were the "relevant past."
                        Davis v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 465 S.E.2d 2 (1995).

                        Former G.S. 122-58.1 et seq., and the related definition of mental illness under former G.S. 122-36 were not unconstitutionally vague. In re Salem, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 228 S.E.2d 649 (1976).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Facts Supporting Finding as to Mental Illness. - The facts which the court recorded as supporting its ultimate findings, that respondent had delusions as to the extent of the danger posed by the Ku Klux Klan, that she misinterpreted stimuli, and that
                        she was out of touch with reality, might have furnished some support for the ultimate finding that she was mentally ill, but they furnished no support for the court's alternative finding that she was inebriate. In re Hogan,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 232 S.E.2d 492 (1977).

                    <p>
                        The appellant could be found "mentally ill" although he was neither psychotic nor drug or alcohol dependent. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 532 S.E.2d 553 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Involuntary commitment of an individual under G.S. 122C-268(j) was improper because, even assuming that the trial court successfully incorporated the contents of the report by the individual's doctor into its order, the order was insufficient to support
                        the involuntary commitment because (1) the trial court's findings reflected the individual's mental illness, but they did not indicate that the individual's illness or any of the individual's symptoms would persist and endanger
                        the individual within the near future pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(a)(1); and (2) the trial court's findings were insufficient to support its conclusion that the individual was dangerous to others pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(b).
                        In re Whatley, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 267, 736 S.E.2d 527 (2012).

                        122-36 (see now G.S. 122C-3) and former G.S. 122-55.2 (see now G.S. 122C-53, 122C-58, and 122C-62), as they do to those prisoners who remain in prison for their mental health care. Baugh v. Woodard,

                        Mental Health Records Previously Admitted Into Evidence In Parental Rights Termination Case. - Trial court did not err by considering mental health records of a mother contained within the underlying file and previously admitted into evidence in proceedings
                        to terminate her parental rights, because the mental health records challenged by the mother were originally admitted into evidence during a permanency planning review hearing and were not challenged by the mother at that time.

                        Facts Negating Finding as to Mental Retardation. - Where the defendant had an IQ of 70 and presented evidence that he was employed and was able to function in society, the evidence negated a finding that he had deficit adaptive behavior. The defendant
                        did not show he was mentally retarded. State v. Best, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 502</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 45 (1996).

                        Insufficient Support for Determination that Patient was Dangerous. - Involuntary commitment order was error because the order contained insufficient findings, as specifically required by G.S. 122C-268(j), to support the trial court's determination that
                        the patient was dangerous to himself and to others; statements in a physician's report, incorporated by the order, that the patient was a 56-year-old white male, with a history of alcohol abuse/dependence, admitted with manic episode,
                        and who continued to be symptomatic with limited insight regarding his illness, were not sufficient to support the trial court's findings. In re Booker, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 433, 667
                        S.E.2d 302 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in ordering the involuntary commitment of the respondent because the evidence in the record on appeal was insufficient to satisfy the statutory criteria since there was no evidence that the respondent's refusal to take his medication
                        created a serious health risk in the near future, an expert's only testimony concerning the respondent's "nourishment" was that he lost some "unknown amount" of weight, but that his current weight was safe, and the respondent's
                        threat to sue his guardian and his alleged aggressive, but non-violent, actions toward the hospital staff could not be viewed as a threat to inflict "serious bodily harm." In re W.R.D., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite>                        512, 790 S.E.2d 344 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in involuntarily committing the respondent because, while the trial court's findings reflected the respondent's mental illness, there was no finding of the respondent suffering serious physical debilitation within the near future unless
                        adequate treatment was given or that there was a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment was given. In re J.P.S., <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 823 S.E.2d 917 (2019).

                    <p>
                        There was no evidence supporting the trial court's finding that respondent was dangerous to others because the psychologist did not state any opinion that respondent was dangerous to others, only that she was a danger to herself, and the hospital witness
                        did not testify that respondent had threatened anyone or presented any danger to others. In re J.C.D., - N.C. App. - , 828 S.E.2d 186 (May 21, 2019).

                    <p>
                        Respondent's involuntary commitment was erroneous as the findings of fact did not support the trial court's conclusion that she was dangerous to herself because a physician's testimony showed that, as of the hearing date, respondent was stabilized, medicated,
                        and not suffering from any acute symptoms; although she had been a danger to herself in the past, that history alone could not support a finding that she would be a danger to herself in the future; her four psychiatric stays within
                        the past two years and her schizophrenia did not support the conclusion she would be a danger to herself within the near future; and there was no evidence that her refusal to take her medication created a serious health risk in
                        the near future. In re N.U., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 840 S.E.2d 296 (2020).

                        In a case in which a trial court recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully challenged the sufficiency of the findings under G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) regarding whether, without treatment,
                        his psychiatric condition would deteriorate and predictably result in dangerousness. The trial court's written findings, coupled with the findings incorporated from a doctor's report, were sufficient to support the trial court's
                        determination that, based on the patient's psychiatric history, he was in need of treatment in order to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably result in dangerousness. In re Webber,

                            class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                    <p>
                        In a case in which a patient challenged a trial court's order recommitting him to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully argued that there was insufficient evidence to support the trial court's findings
                        that his condition would deteriorate and that he could likely become dangerous because, as the patient argued, his treating physician's testimony regarding the patient's history of violence and communication of threats was incompetent
                        evidence because it was based on hearsay. The physician testified as an expert witness, and it was appropriate for him to base an expert opinion on both his personal examination of the patient and other information included in
                        the patient's official medical records, and G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) required the physician to rely on the patient's psychiatric history. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d
                        468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                    <p>
                        Respondent was dangerous to himself where the evidence showed that he was unable without constant professional 24 hour supervision and medical treatment to satisfy his needs for personal or medical care, self-protection, and safety, he was grossly delusional,
                        paranoid, and manic, he was likely to suffer debilitation without treatment, his loss of touch with reality made it difficult for him to exercise judgment in the conduct of his daily affairs, and he was at risk of harm outside
                        the medical facility. Thus, there was a reasonable probability that he would suffer imminent harm absent commitment. In re B.S., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. App.</cite> 414, 840 S.E.2d 308 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in entering an involuntary commitment order because it properly found that a patient was a danger to himself; the trial court's finding the patient's ACT team was unable to sufficiently care for his dental and nourishment needs
                        created the nexus between his mental illness and future harm to himself, and the trial court heard evidence of actions the patient was unable to control and of his severely impaired insight as to his own condition. In re C.G.,

                        Trial court's findings of fact sufficiently showed that respondent was a danger to himself and others given his schizoaffective disorder, past hospitalizations, history of suicidal ideations, fast and incoherent speech, and recent expression of suicidal
                        ideations toward his mother. In re Q.J., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 20, 2021).

                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that many consumers of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services are uncertain about their rights and responsibilities and how to access the public service system to obtain appropriate care and
                    treatment. The General Assembly recognizes the importance of ensuring that consumers have information about the availability of services and access to resources to obtain timely quality care. There is established the MH/DD/SA Consumer
                    Advocacy Program. The purpose of this Program is to provide consumers, their families, and providers with the information and advocacy needed to locate appropriate services, resolve complaints, or address common concerns and promote
                    community involvement. It is further the intent of the General Assembly that the Department, within available resources and pursuant to its duties under this Chapter, ensure that the performance of the mental health care system in
                    this State is closely monitored, reviews are conducted, findings and recommendations and reports are made, and that local and systemic problems are identified and corrected when necessary to promote the rights and interests of all
                    consumers of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.

                    Tiered State-County Special Assistance Pilot. - Session Laws 2013-360, s. 12D.2(a)-(e), provides: "(a) As used in this section, the term 'group home' means any facility that (i) is licensed under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, (ii) meets the definition of a supervised living facility under 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(1) or 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(3), and (iii) serves adults whose primary diagnosis is mental illness or a developmental disability
                    but may also have other diagnoses.

                <p>
                    "(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a State-County Special Assistance program that allows counties greater flexibility in serving individual needs within their communities and greater control over how county funds are used to support
                    this program in light of the fact that counties are required to pay for fifty percent (50%) of the costs of this program. To that end, the General Assembly directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program
                    in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(c) The Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Aging and Adult Services (Department), shall establish a pilot program to implement a tiered rate structure within the State-County Special Assistance program for individuals residing in group
                    homes, in-home living arrangements, and assisted living residences as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html#t131Da01s131D-2.1" target="_blank">G.S. 131D-2.1</a></cite>. The purposes
                    of the pilot program are to (i) determine the best way to implement a block grant for this program statewide and (ii) test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a tiered rate structure to address program participants' intensity
                    of need, including medication management. The Department shall select a minimum of four and a maximum of six counties to participate in the pilot program, at least two of which shall be rural counties and at least two of which shall
                    be urban counties. The pilot program shall (i) be implemented during the 2013-2014 fiscal year, (ii) operate for at least a 12-month period, and (iii) comply with any agreements in effect between the State of North Carolina and the
                    United States government.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(d) The Department shall implement the pilot program in collaboration with the local departments of social services in the counties selected for participation. As part of the pilot program, the selected counties shall receive a State General Fund allocation
                    as a block grant to be equally matched with county general funds. The General Fund allocation provided to each county participating in the pilot program shall be calculated based upon the average annual Special Assistance expenditures
                    for that county during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, adjusted for the amount of projected annual growth in the number of Special Assistance recipients in that county during the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium. These funds may be used to
                    pay for room, board, and personal care services, including medication management, for individuals eligible to receive State-County Special Assistance, subject to the following limitations and requirements:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) These funds shall not be used to cover any portion of the cost of providing services for which an individual receives Medicaid coverage.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) The pilot program shall comply with all federal and State requirements governing the existing State-County Special Assistance program, except that Section 12D.3 does not apply to the pilot program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The tiered rate structure shall be based upon intensity of need, and an individual's placement within a tier shall be based upon an independent assessment of the individual's need for room, board, and assistance with activities of daily living, including
                    medication management.
                </p>
                <p>

                    the Department of Health and Human Services shall conduct a pilot program to assess the provision of overnight respite services in adult day care programs. The Secretary shall select a minimum of two, and a maximum of four, stable
                    and successful certified adult day care programs in which to conduct the pilot. At least two of the programs selected shall be operated by an organization that has been offering adult day care in North Carolina since 1980 and has received
                    national recognition including all of the following criteria: designated as a National Model Adult Day Care Center by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, designated as the only Teaching Day Center for recipients of North Carolina adult
                    day care startup funds, received the North Carolina Non-Profit Center's Non-Profit Sector Stewardship Award for exemplary stewardship of resources, and received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) The provision of 24-hour care under this act shall not exceed 14 consecutive calendar days, or more than 60 total calendar days, during a 365-day period, for each participant receiving overnight respite services. The capacity of the 24-hour overnight
                    respite program authorized under this act shall not exceed six beds. The State is not authorized to pay for any overnight respite services offered through this pilot, and the pilot shall not be eligible to enroll or otherwise participate
                    in the Medicaid program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(c) An adult day care program participating in this pilot shall be currently certified by the Department to provide adult day care. An adult day care program participating in the pilot shall be exempt from adult care home licensure pursuant to Article
                    1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 131D</a></cite> of the General Statutes and shall be exempt from licensure under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131E.html" target="_blank">Chapter 131E</a></cite>                    and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The Department of Health and Human Services shall adopt rules to include minimum requirements to ensure the
                    health and safety of adult day care overnight respite participants. These requirements shall specify program management, staffing, building specifications, fire safety, sanitation, nutrition, enrollment, medication management, and
                    program activities. Participant assessments conducted by the adult day care pilot programs shall provide sufficient information to ensure appropriate care and to protect the health and safety of participants but shall not be more onerous
                    than current adult day care assessments. The Division of Health Service Regulation shall have the authority to enforce the rules adopted by the Department. Prior to the provision of overnight respite services, an adult day care program
                    participating in the pilot shall receive an initial inspection by the Division of Health Service Regulation for compliance with the rules. On a basis not less than every six months, the Division of Health Service Regulation shall conduct
                    monitoring visits and shall also be responsible for the investigation of complaints. Each adult day care program participating in the pilot shall periodically report the number of individuals served and the average daily census to
                    the Division of Health Service Regulation, on a schedule determined by the Division. The Division of Health Service Regulation shall have the authority to suspend admissions or terminate the pilot program at any time due to noncompliance
                    with regulatory requirements which has resulted in death or serious physical harm, or when there is a substantial risk that death or serious physical harm will occur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "2(a). The Department of Health and Human Services shall report on the status of the pilot once a year to the Program Evaluation Division. The Program Evaluation Division shall evaluate the provision of overnight respite services in an adult day care
                    program through the experiences of this pilot. The evaluation shall include whether this pilot was successful as measured by the participants in receipt of overnight respite, the primary caregivers of participants, the adult day care
                    programs participating in the pilot, and the Department of Health and Human Services. On or before October 1, 2014, the Program Evaluation Division shall provide a report to the General Assembly on the feasibility of continuing to
                    provide overnight respite in an adult day care program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) Following the 2014 report and in order to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the pilot, the Department of Health and Human Services shall coordinate with the Program Evaluation Division regarding the collection of additional information.
                    The Program Evaluation Division shall specify what information the Department needs to collect and the timeframe for reporting the information. Based on information collected through the Department, the Program Evaluation Division
                    shall provide information on each of the items below which will assist in determining whether the provision of overnight respite in an adult day care setting is a worthwhile service.

                <p>
                    "(10) A recommendation regarding whether the current regulations are sufficient to ensure the safety and well-being of residents participating in overnight respite in an adult day care setting.

                <p>
                    It is the policy of the State to assure basic human rights to each client of a facility. These rights include the right to dignity, privacy, humane care, and freedom from mental and physical abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Each facility shall assure
                    to each client the right to live as normally as possible while receiving care and treatment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is further the policy of this State that each client who is admitted to and is receiving services from a facility has the right to treatment, including access to medical care and habilitation, regardless of age or degree of mental illness, developmental
                    disabilities, or substance abuse. Each client has the right to an individualized written treatment or habilitation plan setting forth a program to maximize the development or restoration of his capabilities.

                        Applicability. - Workers' compensation claimant had no statutory right to bar the public disclosure of his workers' compensation file because (1) the disclosure of documents that were not awards was statutorily prevented, (2) the general assembly did
                        not exempt awards, (3) the physician-patient privilege was irrelevant, (4) the prohibition against disclosing mental health records did not apply, and (5) the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act did not apply to
                        the Industrial Commission (Commission) and let physicians disclose health information to the Commission. Mastanduno v. Nat'l Freight Indus., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 821 S.E.2d 592

                        Mental Health Records Previously Admitted Into Evidence In Parental Rights Termination Case. - Trial court did not err by considering mental health records of a mother contained within the underlying file and previously admitted into evidence in proceedings
                        to terminate her parental rights, because the mental health records challenged by the mother were originally admitted into evidence during a permanency planning review hearing and were not challenged by the mother at that time.

                    "State" in subsection (a3). The language at the beginning of the October 1, 2019, version of subsection (a2) should probably read "Any State facility" and the language in the October 1, 2019, version of subsection (a3) should probably
                    read "any State facility."

                        voluntarily admitted patient at a State mental hospital, was an exercise of professional judgment, the defendants were not liable to the plaintiff for their actions. Alt v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite>                        307, 435 S.E.2d 773 (1993).

                        as possible. A discharge plan may not be required when it is not feasible because of an unanticipated discontinuation of a client's treatment. With the consent of the client or his legally responsible person, the professionals
                        responsible for the plans shall contact appropriate agencies at the client's destination or in his home community before formulating the recommendations. A copy of the plan shall be furnished to the client or to his legally responsible

        Supervision Ratio Proper.

                        jurisdiction to determine the parameters of the confinement of a not guilty by reason of insanity defendant within the statutory structure of G.S. 122C-62, including the ability to leave the facility to which they are validly committed.

        Right to Choose Attorney.
       </b> - A minor client who is receiving treatment or habilitation from a 24-hour facility, as that term is defined in G.S. 122C-3(14)g, does not have the right to choose at his or her own expense or the expense of his or
                        her legally responsible person, an attorney of the minor client's choice. The legally responsible person is the only one who can choose an attorney for the minor client unless the minor is over the age of 16 and emancipated. See

                    AN INSTRUCTION FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT This is an important legal document. It creates an instruction for mental health treatment. Before signing this document you should know these important facts: This document allows you to
                    make decisions in advance about certain types of mental health treatment. The instructions you include in this declaration will be followed if a physician or eligible psychologist determines that you are incapable of making and communicating
                    treatment decisions. Otherwise you will be considered capable to give or withhold consent for the treatments. Your instructions may be overridden if you are being held in accordance with civil commitment law. Under the Health Care
                    Power of Attorney you may also appoint a person as your health care agent to make treatment decisions for you if you become incapable. You have the right to revoke this document at any time you have not been determined to be incapable.
                    YOU MAY NOT REVOKE THIS ADVANCE INSTRUCTION WHEN YOU ARE FOUND INCAPABLE BY A PHYSICIAN OR OTHER AUTHORIZED MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDER. A revocation is effective when it is communicated to your attending physician or other provider.
                    The physician or other provider shall note the revocation in your medical record. To be valid, this advance instruction must be signed by two qualified witnesses, personally known to you, who are present when you sign or acknowledge
                    your signature. It must also be acknowledged before a notary public. NOTICE TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT PROVIDER Under North Carolina law, a person may use this advance instruction to provide consent for future mental
                    health treatment if the person later becomes incapable of making those decisions. Under the Health Care Power of Attorney the person may also appoint a health care agent to make mental health treatment decisions for the person when
                    incapable. A person is "incapable" when in the opinion of a physician or eligible psychologist the person currently lacks sufficient understanding or capacity to make and communicate mental health treatment decisions. This document
                    becomes effective upon its proper execution and remains valid unless revoked. Upon being presented with this advance instruction, the physician or other provider must make it a part of the person's medical record. The attending physician
                    or other mental health treatment provider must act in accordance with the statements expressed in the advance instruction when the person is determined to be incapable, unless compliance is not consistent with G.S. 122C-74(g). The
                    physician or other mental health treatment provider shall promptly notify the principal and, if applicable, the health care agent, and document noncompliance with any part of an advance instruction in the principal's medical record.
                    The physician or other mental health treatment provider may rely upon the authority of a signed, witnessed, dated, and notarized advance instruction, as provided in G.S. 122C-75."

                        Requirement. - An offer of employment by a provider licensed under this Chapter to an applicant to fill a position that does not require the applicant to have an occupational license is conditioned on consent to a State and national criminal history record
                        check of the applicant. If the applicant has been a resident of this State for less than five years, then the offer of employment is conditioned on consent to a State and national criminal history record check of the applicant.
                        The national criminal history record check shall include a check of the applicant's fingerprints. If the applicant has been a resident of this State for five years or more, then the offer is conditioned on consent to a State criminal
                        history record check of the applicant. A provider shall not employ an applicant who refuses to consent to a criminal history record check required by this section. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, within five business
                        days of making the conditional offer of employment, a provider shall submit a request to the Department of Public Safety under G.S. 143B-939 to conduct a criminal history record check required by this section or shall submit a
                        request to a private entity to conduct a State criminal history record check required by this section. Notwithstanding G.S. 143B-939, the Department of Public Safety shall return the results of national criminal history record
                        checks for employment positions not covered by Public Law 105-277 to the Department of Health and Human Services, Criminal Records Check Unit. Within five business days of receipt of the national criminal history of the person,
                        the Department of Health and Human Services, Criminal Records Check Unit, shall notify the provider as to whether the information received may affect the employability of the applicant. In no case shall the results of the national
                        criminal history record check be shared with the provider. Providers shall make available upon request verification that a criminal history check has been completed on any staff covered by this section. A county that has adopted
                        an appropriate local ordinance and has access to the Department of Public Safety data bank may conduct on behalf of a provider a State criminal history record check required by this section without the provider having to submit
                        a request to the Department of Justice. In such a case, the county shall commence with the State criminal history record check required by this section within five business days of the conditional offer of employment by the provider.
                        All criminal history information received by the provider is confidential and may not be disclosed, except to the applicant as provided in subsection (c) of this section. For purposes of this subsection, the term "private entity"
                        means a business regularly engaged in conducting criminal history record checks utilizing public records obtained from a State agency.

                    community support services pending a final agency decision based on a fair hearing of the provider's appeal filed with the Department under its community support provider appeal process. A provider of community support services whose
                    endorsement, Medicaid participation, or services have been suspended is not entitled to payment during the period the appeal is pending, and the Department shall make no such payment to the provider during that period. If the final
                    agency decision is in favor of the provider, the Department shall remove the suspension, commence payment for provider services, and reimburse the provider for payments withheld during the period of appeal. Contracts between the Department
                    or a local management entity and the provider shall contain a provision indicating the circumstances under which a provider may appeal an agency decision and giving notice of the suspension of payments to the provider while the appeal
                    is pending. This subsection applies to community support provider appeals pending in the Department of Health and Human Services or the Office of Administrative Hearings, as applicable, on and after July 1, 2008.

                    of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver will be completed by July 1, 2013, and will result in the establishment of a system that is capable of managing all public resources that may become available for mental health, intellectual and developmental

                <p>
                    At any time that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services determines that an area authority is in imminent danger of failing financially and of failing to provide direct services to clients, the Secretary, after providing written notification
                    of the Secretary's intent to the area board and after providing the area authority an opportunity to be heard, may assume control of the financial affairs of the area authority and appoint an administrator to exercise the powers assumed.
                    This assumption of control shall have the effect of divesting the area authority of its powers as to the adoption of budgets, expenditures of money, and all other financial powers conferred in the area authority by law. County funding
                    of the area authority shall continue when the State has assumed control of the financial affairs of the area authority. At no time after the State has assumed this control shall a county withdraw funds previously obligated or appropriated
                    to the area authority. The Secretary shall adopt rules to define imminent danger of failing financially and of failing to provide direct services to clients.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon assumption of financial control, the Department shall, in conjunction with the area authority, develop and implement a corrective plan of action and provide notification to the area authority's board of directors of the plan. The Department shall
                    also keep the county board of commissioners and the area authority's board of directors informed of any ongoing concerns or problems with the area authority's finances.

                    Session Laws 2018-5, s. 11F.10(a), provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds that a viable State-funded behavioral health system is critical to accomplishing the State's goals for behavioral health, meeting the needs of the covered populations, and achieving
                    the desired outcomes detailed in the Department of Health and Human Services' Strategic Plan for Improvement of Behavioral Health Services. Integral to assessing the State's behavioral health system is the development of a method to
                    determine the viability of local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs) and the establishment of short-term and intermediate term solvency standards that provide a uniform analysis of each LME/MCO's financial position,
                    provide a mechanism for ongoing assessment of each LME/MCO's viability, inform the State's funding decisions, and enhance short-term and intermediate term planning by the LME/MCOs."

                    contract, the LME/MCO to comply with G.S. 122C-125.2, as enacted by subsection (b) of this section."

                        information, the court may either deny disclosure or may make such other appropriate orders as are permitted under Rule 26(c) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.

                <p>
                    "(5) The petitioner and the respondent agency shall have 15 days from the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision to present written arguments in opposition to or in support of the proposal for decision to the designated official of the Department
                    who will make the final decision. If neither written arguments are presented, nor extension of time granted by the final agency decision maker for good cause, within 15 days of the date of the mailing of the proposal for decision,
                    the proposal for decision becomes final. If written arguments are presented, such arguments shall be considered and the final decision shall be rendered. The final decision shall be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of
                    the filing of the petition. This time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by final agency decision maker, for good cause shown. The final decision shall be served upon the petitioner or the petitioner's representative

                <p>
                    "(6) A petitioner who is dissatisfied with the final decision of the Department may file, within 30 days of the service of the decision, a petition for judicial review in the Superior Court of Wake County or of the county from which the case arose. The
                    judicial review shall be conducted according to Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes.

                    "(7) In the event of a conflict between federal law or regulations and State law or regulations, federal law or regulations shall control. This section applies to all petitions that are filed by a Medicaid community support services provider on or after
                    July 1, 2008, and for all Medicaid community support services provider petitions that have been filed at the Office of Administrative Hearings previous to July 1, 2008, but for which a hearing on the merits has not been commenced prior
                    to that date. The requirement that the agency decision must be rendered not more than 180 days from the date of the filing of the petition for hearing shall not apply to (i) community support services provider petitions that were filed
                    at the Office of Administrative Hearings or (ii) requests for a hearing under the Department's informal settlement process prior to the effective date of this act. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall transfer all cases affected
                    by this section to the Department of Health and Human Services within 30 days of the effective date of this section. This act preempts the existing informal appeal process and reconsideration review process at the Department of Health
                    and Human Services and the existing appeal process at the Office of Administrative Hearings with regard to all appeals filed by Medicaid community support services providers under the Medical Assistance program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(e3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the Department of Health and Human Services may, pursuant to its statutory authority or federal Medicaid requirements, suspend the endorsement or Medicaid participation of a provider of
                    community support services pending a final agency decision based on a fair hearing of the provider's appeal filed with the Department under its community support provider appeal process. A provider of community support services whose
                    endorsement, Medicaid participation, or services have been suspended is not entitled to payment during the period the appeal is pending, and the Department shall make no such payment to the provider during that period. If the final
                    agency decision is in favor of the provider, the Department shall remove the suspension, commence payment for provider services, and reimburse the provider for payments withheld during the period of appeal. Contracts between the Department
                    or a local management entity and the provider shall contain a provision indicating the circumstances under which a provider may appeal an agency decision and giving notice of the suspension of payments to the provider while the appeal
                    is pending. This subsection applies to community support provider appeals pending in the Department of Health and Human Services or the Office of Administrative Hearings, as applicable, on and after July 1, 2008.

                <p>
                    "(e4) The Department's community support provider appeals process established under this section shall expire July 1, 2010. The Department shall report to the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Senate
                    Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, and the Fiscal Research Division on March 1, 2009, October

                        closure is approved, unless a different effective date applies under this subsection. If a bill that specifically disapproves the State facility closure is introduced in either house of the General Assembly before the thirty-first

                    The director of each State facility may appoint as special police officers the number of employees of their respective facilities they consider necessary. Within the grounds of the State facility the employees appointed as special police officers have
                    all the powers of police officers of cities. The Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, may assign these special police officers to other State-operated facilities on a temporary basis to carry out the powers allowed under this section
                    and as otherwise provided by laws relating to the specific joint security force to which they are assigned. Upon this temporary assignment, the special police officer will take the oath in G.S. 122C-184 for that specific facility.
                    Following the oath, the police officer has the right to arrest without warrant individuals committing violations of the State law or the ordinances or rules of that facility in their presence and to bring the offenders before a magistrate
                    who shall proceed as in other criminal cases.

                <p>
                    It is State policy to encourage voluntary admissions to facilities. It is further State policy that no individual shall be involuntarily committed to a 24-hour facility unless that individual is mentally ill or a substance abuser and dangerous to self
                    or others. All admissions and commitments shall be accomplished under conditions that protect the dignity and constitutional rights of the individual.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is further State policy that, except as provided in G.S. 122C-212(b), individuals who have been voluntarily admitted shall be discharged upon application and that involuntarily committed individuals shall be discharged as soon as a less restrictive
                    mode of treatment is appropriate.

                        Constitutionality. - The statutory scheme for involuntary commitment is constitutional. In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 299 S.E.2d 677 (1983); French v. Blackburn, 428 F. Supp. 1351 (M.D.N.C. 1977),

                    <p>
                        The North Carolina General Assembly has enacted an excellent legislative scheme which adequately protects the interests of all who may be involved in an involuntary commitment proceeding. In re Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite>                        581, 299 S.E.2d 677 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Public Policy to Prevent Unnecessary Commitments. - The policy of this State is to prevent the possibility that persons who are not mentally ill or inebriates and dangerous to themselves or others would be involuntarily committed. McLean v. Sale,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 703 (1982).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Purpose of Involuntary Commitment Proceeding. - The primary purpose of an involuntary commitment proceeding is to protect the person who, after due process, has been found to be both mentally ill and imminently dangerous, by placing such a person in more
                        protected environment where the danger may be minimized and his treatment facilitated; in a real sense the proceeding is an important step in his medical and psychiatric treatment. In re Farrow, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite>                        680, 255 S.E.2d 777 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Two purposes for the involuntary commitment statute are (1) to allow temporary withdrawal from society of those who may be dangerous and (2) to provide treatment. In re Medlin, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 33, 295
                        S.E.2d 604 (1982).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An involuntary commitment proceeding is a proceeding of a civil nature which is governed by pertinent Rules of Civil Procedure. In re Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 247 S.E.2d 778 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Requirements for Entering Commitment Order. - To enter a commitment order, the trial court is required to ultimately find two distinct facts, i.e., that the respondent is mentally ill and is dangerous to himself or to others. In re Collins,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 271 S.E.2d 72 (1980).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Requirement That Person Be Dangerous. - By requiring that the person be found dangerous to himself or others, the legislature has made it clear that involuntary commitment is not for all those who are mentally ill, or even for those whose mental illness
                        may make it necessary for them to have custodial care. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where doctor testified only that the respondent was unable to care for herself and that she was a complete nursing care problem, and there was no showing that the respondent was dangerous to herself, the requirements for involuntary commitment were not
                        met. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Standard of Commitment for Minors. - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> was written to provide constitutionally defensible procedural and evidentiary rules. To
                        allow juvenile court judges to commit minors to mental institutions with a lesser standard than that set forth in former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122</a></cite> would subject
                        such commitments to constitutional challenge as a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Exercise of Professional Judgment. - Adopting the standard enunciated in Youngberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28 (1982), the court held that so long as the requisite procedures were followed, and the decision to restrain plaintiff,
                        a voluntarily admitted patient at a State mental hospital, was an exercise of professional judgment, the defendants were not liable to the plaintiff for their actions. Alt v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite>                        307, 435 S.E.2d 773 (1993).

        Failure to Seek Involuntary Commitment of Patient.
       </b> - The statutory immunity given by this section makes it most unlikely that the North Carolina Supreme Court would hold that North Carolina's public policy and its tort law would impose tort liabilities upon psychiatrists
                        at Veterans Administration hospital for a mistake in not seeking involuntary commitment of a patient. Currie v. United States, 836 F.2d 209 (4th Cir. 1987).

        Plaintiff Must Allege Gross or Intentional Negligence or Immunity Will Preclude Claim.
       </b> - Absent allegation of gross or intentional negligence, plaintiffs' claims of negligence on part of health care providers at Veteran's Administration facility were precluded by statutory immunity. Cantrell v. United
                        States, 735 F. Supp. 670 (E.D.N.C. 1988).

                    <p>
                        Because there was a question of fact as to whether defendant rehabilitation center and its chief operating officer followed the applicable standard of care, they were not entitled to qualified immunity under G.S. 122C-210.1 on plaintiff's wrongful death
                        claims as a matter of law; plaintiff alleged facts that defendants had violated accepted professional judgment, practice and standards, an investigative report from the North Carolina Division of Facility Services found that the
                        facility had failed to adequately supervise plaintiff's brother, and plaintiff's complaint was certified by an expert under N.C. R. Civ. P. 9(j) that the medical care outlined in the complaint did not comply with the applicable
                        standard of care. Snyder v. Learning Servs. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 653 S.E.2d 548 (2007).

                        Liability for Wrongful Acts of Discharged Patient. - The directors and superintendent of a hospital for the insane acting under former statutory provisions in discharging or releasing a patient therefrom could not be held responsible in damages for the

                        care. Klassette ex rel. Klassette v. Mecklenburg County Area Mental Health, Mental Retardation &amp; Substance Abuse Auth., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 364 S.E.2d 179 (1988).

                        Duty to Refer to Another Facility. - This section imposes on a facility the duty to refer an individual to another facility for treatment; therefore, the facility must necessarily use due care in exercising its judgment not to refer an individual for
                        further treatment. Klassette ex rel. Klassette v. Mecklenburg County Area Mental Health, Mental Retardation &amp; Substance Abuse Auth., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 364 S.E.2d 179 (1988).

        Control Not Conferred by Voluntary Commitment.

                        No Requirement That Minor Voluntarily Committed Receive Medical Examination Within Twenty-Four Hours Of Admission. - Because there was insufficient record evidence that medical care was an integral component of treatment at a psychiatric treatment facility,
                        there was no statutory requirement that a minor who was voluntarily admitted to the facility receive a medical examination within twenty-four hours of admission; the minor made no argument that the requirements of subsection (d)
                        had been violated. In re A.N.B., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 754 S.E.2d 442 (2014).

                        Insufficient Evidence Medical Care Was Integral Component Of Treatment At Psychiatric Treatment Facility. - Subsection (c) did not apply because there was not sufficient record evidence that a psychiatric treatment facility was a facility in which medical
                        care was an integral component of the treatment; the use of prescription medications at the facility was not a sufficient to define it as such a facility. In re A.N.B., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                        407, 754 S.E.2d 442 (2014).

                        interest in being able to seek immediate treatment and the policy of encouraging voluntary admissions, would outweigh any interest the minor might have in a pre-admission hearing. However, the continued confinement of a minor based
                        on that procedure would require procedural safeguards consistent with the due process clause.

                        Confrontation Rights. - Trial court erred in relying solely on a staff member's evaluation in committing a juvenile to a treatment facility because, while the plain language of the statute at issue permitted admission of relevant medical records (such
                        as the staff member's report) into evidence, it also ensured the juvenile's right to confront and cross-examine her, and the staff member's unavailability to testify at the hearing denied the juvenile's right to cross-examine her.

                        Appellate Review. - Because orders of voluntary admission of a minor to a twenty-four hour psychiatric treatment facility can only be for a maximum length of ninety days, appeal from orders of voluntary admission of a minor to a twenty-four hour facility
                        falls into the "capable of repetition, yet evading review" exception to the mootness doctrine. In re A.N.B., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 754 S.E.2d 442 (2014).

                        Because of the State's great interest in preventing unwarranted admission of juveniles into twenty-four hour psychiatric treatment facilities, appeal from orders of voluntary admission of a minor to such a facility falls into the public policy exception
                        of the mootness doctrine. In re A.N.B., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 754 S.E.2d 442 (2014).

                        Failure To Find Minor In Need Of Further Treatment. - Trial court erred in continuing a minor's admission at a psychiatric treatment facility because it failed to make a specific finding that the minor was in need of further treatment at the facility;
                        though need for further treatment is a reasonable inference of the findings and conclusions made, the required ultimate findings of fact must be made explicitly. In re A.N.B., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                        407, 754 S.E.2d 442 (2014).

                        Not Error to Order Readmission Despite Recommendation of Less Restrictive Treatment. - Readmitting a juvenile to a psychiatric residential treatment facility despite a recommendation that the juvenile be discharged to less restrictive treatment did not
                        err because no sufficient lesser facility was available, so (1) literally interpreting G.S. 122C-224.3(f), barring such readmission if less restrictive treatment were appropriate, was absurd, and (2) G.S. 122C-2 intended use of
                        available resources. In re M.B., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 771 S.E.2d 615 (2015).

                        to a residence and released from custody; the legislature has not seen fit to confer custody of an involuntary commitment respondent on anyone other than law enforcement or other person properly designated prior to and during a

                <p>
                    "a. How the purpose of the statutory requirement would be better served by waiving the requirement and substituting the proposed change under the waiver.

                <p>
                    "a. The request meets the requirements of this section.

                    "(3) The Secretary shall evaluate the effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services and protection of health, safety, and welfare under the waiver. The Secretary shall send a report on
                    the evaluation to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substances Abuse Services by October 1, 2009. The report shall include data gathered from all participating LMEs since the

                    "(6) In no event shall the substitution of a licensed clinical social worker, masters level psychiatric nurse, or masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist under a waiver granted under this section be construed as authorization to expand the
                    scope of practice of the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist.
                </p>

                        Common Law. - At common law there was a right to detain a mentally ill person in order to protect such person from self-injury and the public from injury at the hands of such deranged person. This doubtless accounts for the action of the legislature in

                        A commitment order is essentially a judgment by which a person is deprived of his liberty, and as a result, he is entitled to the safeguard of a determination by a neutral officer of the court that reasonable grounds exist for his original detention,
                        just as he would be if he were to be deprived of liberty in a criminal context. In re Reed, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 249 S.E.2d 864 (1978).

                        Contents and Sufficiency of Affidavit. - The affidavit must set out facts upon which the affiant's opinion is based. Such facts must be sufficient to establish to the affiant's satisfaction that the patient is imminently dangerous to himself or others.

                        Petition for involuntary commitment which was not confirmed by oath or affirmation before a duly authorized certifying officer did not comply with the requirements of former G.S. 122-58.3(a) (see now G.S. 122C-261 and G.S. 122C-281) and could not serve
                        as a basis for involuntary commitment. In re Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985).

                        Insufficient Affidavit. - An affidavit which stated that the respondent was "believed to have been on drugs for a number of years," was "so mixed up," and was "at a place where he is dangerous to himself" was insufficient to establish reasonable grounds
                        for the issuance of a custody order. In re Reed, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 249 S.E.2d 864 (1978).

                    <p>
                        No Duty to Third Parties. - When a respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding is delivered to a hospital for an initial examination to recommend whether commitment is required, neither the examiner nor the hospital obtains custody or a legal right
                        to control the respondent unless and until involuntary commitment is recommended; neither the examiner nor the facility owes a duty to third parties for harm resulting from an examiner's recommendation, even if the examination
                        failed to comply with statutory requirements. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Control Over Respondent. - While it is the finding by the physician that directly results in the restraint of the respondent, the examiner at a first examination is empowered only to make certain findings, and it is only after specific findings are made
                        that control is exercised. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).

                        Examiner has no discretion whether or not to release a respondent, but it is the statutes that dictate the result on the basis of the examiner's findings, and the examiner is not authorized by law to deviate from those statutorily-imposed results; nor
                        may the examiner assume control over the respondent, and thus, in short a right or duty to make a determination that may result in assuming a legal right to control is distinct from the legal right to control itself. McArdle v.
                        Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).

                        Waiver of Challenge to Sufficiency of Affidavit. - Complainant waived any challenge to the sufficiency of the affidavit to support a magistrate's original custody order because the complainant failed to raise the issue of the sufficiency of the affidavit
                        during the first involuntary commitment hearing and the record did not reflect that the complainant raised it at any of the four recommitment hearings preceding the complainant's appeal. In re Moore,

                        No Special Relationship Imposed Liability. - Trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing a family's negligence complaint because the nature of the duty imposed, in light of the particulars of the statutory scheme, was insufficient to impose
                        a "special relationship" between healthcare providers and the patient; the healthcare providers had no right to control the patient at the time of the alleged breach of duty to him because it occurred prior to his admission to
                        their care. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).

                        Jurisdiction. - In a case in which a trial court's order recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, while he used the phrase subject
                        matter jurisdiction, he was actually arguing that the trial court did not have authority to order an 180-day commitment under G.S. 122C-271(b). There was no dispute that the trial court had authority to adjudicate the issues in
                        dispute and had jurisdiction over the parties, as a result, the trial court's May 21, 2007 order was not void, even if contrary to law; the trial court obtained jurisdiction over the civil commitment proceedings when the petition
                        and affidavit were filed pursuant to G.S. 122C-261. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                        Statement Held Not to Establish Grounds for Commitment. - Statement that "respondent has strange behavior and irrational in her thinking" was not a statement of fact but a pure conclusion of the affiant, and did not suffice to establish reasonable grounds
                        for issuance of commitment order. In re Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Statement Held Not to Establish Mental Illness or Dangerousness. - Statements that respondent "Leaves home and no one knows of her whereabouts, and at times spends the night away from home. Accuses husband of improprieties" did not establish facts showing
                        or tending to show that respondent was mentally ill or dangerous to herself or others. In re Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 328 S.E.2d 588 (1985).

                        Effect of G.S. 8-53. - For discussion of former statutory provisions making it manifest that the physician's role in involuntary commitment proceedings was not intended to be inhibited by G.S. 8-53, see In re Farrow, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C.

                    <p>
                        Defenses of Insanity and Unconsciousness Distinguished. - The defenses of insanity and unconsciousness are not the same; a defendant found not guilty by reason of unconsciousness, as distinct from insanity, is not subject to commitment to a hospital for
                        the mentally ill; however, such a defendant is subject to involuntary commitment to a facility for the mentally ill if found in a civil commitment proceeding to be mentally ill and either dangerous to himself or others or in need
                        of treatment in order to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably result in dangerousness. State v. Fields, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 204</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 740 (1989).

                        Denial of Gun Permit Not Warranted. - G.S. 14-404(c)(4) did not support the denial of a gun permit application to an applicant since the G.S. 122C-261(e), 122C-262 122C-263, 122C-266, and 122C-268 requirements were not met, even though the applicant was
                        taken for an involuntary psychiatric examination when the applicant was 21 years old; neither inpatient nor outpatient commitment was recommended. Waldron v. Batten, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                        237, 662 S.E.2d 568 (2008).

        Excessive Force.
       </b> - Where a decedent was tased when officers executed an involuntary commitment order on the decedent, the officers used unreasonably excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment because, inter alia, immediately
                        tasing a non-criminal, mentally ill individual, who seconds before had been conversational, was not a proportional response; however, the officers were entitled to qualified immunity as to the excessive force claim because the

                    "(6) In no event shall the substitution of a licensed clinical social worker, masters level psychiatric nurse, or masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist under a waiver granted under this section be construed as authorization to expand the
                    scope of practice of the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist.

        Excessive Force.

                        Examiner has no discretion whether or not to release a respondent, but it is the statutes that dictate the result on the basis of the examiner's findings, and the examiner is not authorized by law to deviate from those statutorily-imposed results; nor
                        may the examiner assume control over the respondent, and thus, in short a right or duty to make a determination that may result in assuming a legal right to control is distinct from the legal right to control itself. McArdle v.

        Illustrative Case.

                        Trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing a family's negligence complaint because the nature of the duty imposed, in light of the particulars of the statutory scheme, was insufficient to impose a "special relationship" between healthcare
                        providers and the patient; the healthcare providers had no right to control the patient at the time of the alleged breach of duty to him because it occurred prior to his admission to their care. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc.,

                        in the community crisis services plan adopted pursuant to G.S. 122C-202.2 that has an available commitment examiner and is capable of performing a first examination in conjunction with a health screening at the same location, unless

                                (1) of this subsection. Any decision to terminate the proceedings or to recommend outpatient commitment after an initial recommendation of inpatient commitment shall be documented and reported to the clerk of superior court
                                in accordance with subsection (e) of this section. If the respondent is temporarily detained and a 24-hour facility is not available or medically appropriate seven days after the issuance of the custody order, a commitment
                                examiner shall report this fact to the clerk of superior court and the proceedings shall be terminated. Termination of proceedings pursuant to this subdivision shall not prohibit or prevent the initiation of new involuntary

                </p>
                <p>
                    "a. How the purpose of the statutory requirement would be better served by waiving the requirement and substituting the proposed change under the waiver.

                <p>
                    "c. How the services to be provided by the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist under the waiver are within each of these professional's scope of practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "d. How the health, safety, and welfare of individuals will continue to be at least as well protected under the waiver as under the statutory requirement.

                <p>
                    "a. The request meets the requirements of this section.

                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The Secretary shall evaluate the effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services and protection of health, safety, and welfare under the waiver. The Secretary shall send a report on
                    the evaluation to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substances Abuse Services by October 1, 2009. The report shall include data gathered from all participating LMEs since the
                    beginning of the pilot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) The waiver granted by the Secretary under this section shall be in effect until October 1, 2012.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) In no event shall the substitution of a licensed clinical social worker, masters level psychiatric nurse, or masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist under a waiver granted under this section be construed as authorization to expand the
                    scope of practice of the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) The Department shall assure that staff performing the duties are trained and privileged to perform the functions identified in the waiver. The Department shall involve stakeholders including, but not limited to, the North Carolina Psychiatric Association,
                    The North Carolina Nurses Association, National Association of Social Workers, The North Carolina Substance Abuse Professional Practice Board, North Carolina Psychological Association, The North Carolina Society for Clinical Social

                        necessary, in carrying out the mandate of this section. McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290

                        Negligence. - Involuntary commitment statutes, including G.S. 122C-263 are designed to protect against arbitrary or ill-considered involuntary commitment and, although there may be some "generalized safety implications" in those statutes, they are not
                        considered public safety statutes as defined by the North Carolina Supreme Court; therefore, any violation thereof cannot be considered negligence per se. Gregory v. Kilbride, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite>                        601, 565 S.E.2d 685 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 164</cite>, 580 S.E.2d 365 (2003).

                        Admissibility of Evidence. - In a case in which a patient challenged a trial court's order recommitting him to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully argued that there was insufficient evidence to support
                        the trial court's findings that his condition would deteriorate and that he could likely become dangerous because, as the patient argued, his treating physician's testimony regarding the patient's history of violence and communication
                        of threats was incompetent evidence because it was based on hearsay. The physician testified as an expert witness, and it was appropriate for him to base an expert opinion on both his personal examination of the patient and other
                        information included in the patient's official medical records, and G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) required the physician to rely on the patient's psychiatric history. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite>                        212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                        Relief from Wrongful Certification. - A complaint which alleged that the defendant had certified that he had examined the plaintiff pursuant to this section and recommended commitment when in fact the plaintiff had not been examined by the defendant was
                        sufficient to state a claim for which relief could be granted for wrongful certification of the plaintiff for admission to a mental hospital. McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 520,
                        248 S.E.2d 372 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 585</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 32 (1979).

                    <p>
                        A physician's failure to perform an examination prior to signing certificate is a violation of the statute, and if plaintiff is involuntarily committed as a result of defendant's actions, a cause of action arises against defendant, and this is true regardless
                        of what may have prompted defendant to fail to make the examination of plaintiff. McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>,

                        Relevance of Reasons for Failing to Examine. - The reasons for which defendant physician failed to make the required examination prior to signing the certificate were competent on the question of punitive damages, but not on the issue of whether defendant
                        violated his statutory duty to plaintiff. McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 703 (1982).

                        Denial of Gun Permit Not Warranted. - G.S. 14-404(c)(4) did not support the denial of a gun permit application to an applicant since the G.S. 122C-261(e), 122C-262, 122C-263, 122C-266, and 122C-268 requirements were not met, even though the applicant
                        was taken for an involuntary psychiatric examination when the applicant was 21 years old; neither inpatient nor outpatient commitment was recommended. Waldron v. Batten, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                        237, 662 S.E.2d 568 (2008).

                        Control Over Respondent. - While it is the finding by the physician that directly results in the restraint of the respondent, the examiner at a first examination is empowered only to make certain findings, and it is only after specific findings are made
                        that control is exercised. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).

                    <p>
                        Control Over Respondent. - Examiner has no discretion whether or not to release a respondent, but it is the statutes that dictate the result on the basis of the examiner's findings, and the examiner is not authorized by law to deviate from those statutorily-imposed
                        results; nor may the examiner assume control over the respondent, and thus, in short a right or duty to make a determination that may result in assuming a legal right to control is distinct from the legal right to control itself.

                        Sufficiency of Court Findings. - In a case in which a trial court recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully challenged the sufficiency of the findings under G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) regarding
                        whether, without treatment, his psychiatric condition would deteriorate and predictably result in dangerousness. The trial court's written findings, coupled with the findings incorporated from a doctor's report, were sufficient
                        to support the trial court's determination that, based on the patient's psychiatric history, he was in need of treatment in order to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably result in dangerousness. In
                        re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                        No Special Relationship Imposed Liability. - Trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing a family's negligence complaint because the nature of the duty imposed, in light of the particulars of the statutory scheme, was insufficient to impose
                        a "special relationship" between healthcare providers and the patient; the healthcare providers had no right to control the patient at the time of the alleged breach of duty to him because it occurred prior to his admission to
                        their care. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing a family's negligence complaint because healthcare providers did not have custody of or a legal right to control a patient when conducting their first examination, and thus, no special relationship
                        was created imposing liability; the county sheriff's department assumed custody of the patient until he was delivered to a 24-hour facility or transported to his home or the home of a consenting individual. McArdle v. Mission Hosp.,
                        Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).

                    <p>
                        Custody. - Following a first examination, custody continues with law enforcement until the respondent is transferred to a 24-hour facility for the custody and treatment of involuntary clients, or, in cases where commitment is not recommended, returned
                        to a residence and released from custody; the legislature has not seen fit to confer custody of an involuntary commitment respondent on anyone other than law enforcement or other person properly designated prior to and during a
                        first examination. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).

                    <p>
                        No Duty to Third Parties. - When a respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding is delivered to a hospital for an initial examination to recommend whether commitment is required, neither the examiner nor the hospital obtains custody or a legal right
                        to control the respondent unless and until involuntary commitment is recommended; neither the examiner nor the facility owes a duty to third parties for harm resulting from an examiner's recommendation, even if the examination
                        failed to comply with statutory requirements. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C.

        Constitutionality of Former Section.
       </b> - Former G.S. 122-58.5 stated that at the minimum the notice should be served 48 hours in advance of the hearing. This time period was constitutionally adequate to allow for sufficient preparation, especially in light
                        of the fact that continuances could be granted, which would prevent any prejudice because of insufficient time to prepare. French v. Blackburn, 428 F. Supp. 1351 (M.D.N.C. 1977), aff'd, 443 U.S. 901, 99 S. Ct. 3091, 61 L. Ed. 2d
                        869 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 122-58.5 used the terms "notify" and "notice." There could be little doubt that these terms were used to carry the full panoply of due process notice mandated by the law of the land. When the legislature uses the term "notice" it means such
                        notice as is required by due process and, therefore, former G.S. 122-58.5 was constitutional on its face. French v. Blackburn, 428 F. Supp. 1351 (M.D.N.C. 1977), aff'd, 443 U.S. 901, 99 S. Ct. 3091, 61 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In light of the nature of the proceedings, the procedure in former G.S. 122-58.5 was reasonably calculated to inform the respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding of the nature and purpose of the hearing and, therefore, was not constitutionally
                        infirm. There is no constitutional mandate to notify the respondent of the burden of proof or to serve upon him a list of witnesses and the substance of their proposed testimony. Such is not even required in a criminal proceeding.
                        French v. Blackburn, 428 F. Supp. 1351 (M.D.N.C. 1977), aff'd, 443 U.S. 901, 99 S. Ct. 3091, 61 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1979).

                        Conditional Release of Insanity Acquittee. - Because the plain language of the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-264(d1), requires that notice of G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 hearings be given
                        to anyone who has requested notice of a hearing concerning discharge or conditional release, the statute recognizes that hearings under G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 are hearings that may involve a conditional release; construing
                        G.S. 122C-268.1, G.S. 122C-276.1, and G.S. 122C-277 in pari materia, it is reasonable to read these statutes as providing the same dispositional alternatives, recommitment, discharge, or conditional release, regardless whether
                        the hearing was initiated by a respondent's treating physician or whether it was automatically calendared pursuant to a statutory mandate, and if a trial court may order a conditional release when requested by a treating physician,
                        then the trial court itself has commensurate authority under G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional release in an automatically calendared proceeding.

App.</cite>                        680, 255 S.E.2d 777 (1979).

                        "Within 24 hours of Arrival" - Applicability. - The words "within 24 hours of arrival" demonstrate the applicability of that provision to the initial commitment phase. It would not make sense to apply that provision to the circumstances of a rehearing
                        at which time there is no longer a question of whether the initial commitment had been proper. In re Lowery, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 67, 428 S.E.2d 861 (1993).

                        Denial of Gun Permit Not Warranted. - G.S. 14-404(c)(4) did not support the denial of a gun permit application to an applicant since the G.S. 122C-261(e), 122C-262, 122C-263, 122C-266, and 122C-268 requirements were not met, even though the applicant
                        was taken for an involuntary psychiatric examination when the applicant was 21 years old; neither inpatient nor outpatient commitment was recommended. Waldron v. Batten, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                        237, 662 S.E.2d 568 (2008).

                        Preservation for Review. - Because a patient did not raise the issue of a violation of subsection (a) before the district court, she failed to preserve the issue for appellate review; the court of appeals improperly vacated the patient's involuntary commitment
                        order because it erred in holding that subsection (a) imposed a statutory mandate that automatically preserves a violation of that provision for appellate review. In re E.D., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 111</cite>,
                        827 S.E.2d 450 (May 10, 2019).

                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) does not require a specific act by a trial judge and does not place any responsibility on a presiding judge, but instead, the provision requires that a physician perform an examination at a designated "state facility"; therefore, subsection
                        (a) does not fit within either category of statutory mandates that would automatically preserve an issue for appellate review. In re E.D., <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 111</cite>, 827 S.E.2d 450 (May 10,

                        Failure to Afford Right of Cross-Examination. - Where the record showed that examining physician's affidavit formed the basis of order of commitment, and respondent was not afforded the right, guaranteed by statute, to cross-examine the physician, the
                        evidence was not sufficient to support the findings required and to support commitment. In re Benton, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 215 S.E.2d 792 (1975).

                        Assuming, without conceding, that a physician's brief statement and conclusion as to the imminent danger of the respondent would support a recommitment order, his failure to appear at the hearing deprived the respondent of his right of confrontation and

                        Findings Prerequisite to Commitment. - Statutory mandate under former statutory provisions required as a condition to a valid commitment order that the district court find two distinct facts: first, that the respondent was mentally ill or inebriate, and
                        second, that the respondent was dangerous to himself or others. In re Carter, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C.

                        In a case in which a trial court recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment, the patient unsuccessfully challenged the sufficiency of the findings under G.S. 122C-263(d)(1)(c) regarding whether, without treatment,
                        his psychiatric condition would deteriorate and predictably result in dangerousness. The trial court's written findings, coupled with the findings incorporated from a doctor's report, were sufficient to support the trial court's
                        determination that, based on the patient's psychiatric history, he was in need of treatment in order to prevent further disability or deterioration that would predictably result in dangerousness. In re Webber,

                        Facts Must Be Found and Recorded. - The two distinct ultimate facts of (1) mental illness or inebriacy and (2) danger under former statutory provisions had to be supported by facts which were found from the evidence and recorded by the district court.
                        In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 244 S.E.2d 189 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Recording of Findings Mandatory. - The direction to the court under former G.S. 122-58.7(i) to record the facts which supported its findings was mandatory. In re Koyi, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 320, 238 S.E.2d 153
                        (1977); In re Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 248 S.E.2d 448 (1978); In re Bartley, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C.

                    <p>
                        No Requirement That Findings Be Based Solely on Medical Evidence. - The involuntary commitment statutes do not require that an order of commitment may issue only when the requisite factual findings are supported by competent medical evidence. All that
                        is required is that the court make the essential findings from "clear, cogent, and convincing evidence." In re Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 247 S.E.2d 778 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        No Overt Act Required. - An overt act may be clear, cogent and convincing evidence which will support a finding of danger, but it is not necessary that there be an overt act to establish dangerousness. In re Salem, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite>                        57, 228 S.E.2d 649 (1976).

                        Threats as Evidence of Dangerousness. - The fundamental differences between a criminal charge based entirely on threats and an involuntary commitment in which threats merely serve as some evidence of the dangerousness of the person weigh against the use
                        of such strict standards in the latter case. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 244 S.E.2d 189 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Inadequate Evidence for Findings. - The finding that respondent was "preoccupied with religious subjects" hardly furnished support for an ultimate finding either that she was mentally ill or that she was imminently dangerous to herself or others. In re
                        Hogan, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 232 S.E.2d 492 (1977).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where doctor testified only that the respondent was unable to care for herself and that she was a complete nursing care problem, there was no showing that the respondent was dangerous to herself and the requirements for involuntary commitment were not
                        met. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628 (1978).

                        Burden of Proof on State. - Subsection (a) of former G.S. 122-58.7 indicated a conscious legislative decision to place the burden on the State to come forward with evidence to justify the commitment within 10 days. In re Jacobs,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 248 S.E.2d 448 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Questions of Fact. - Whether a person is mentally ill or inebriate, and whether he is dangerous to himself or others, present questions of fact. In re Hogan, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 232 S.E.2d 492 (1977).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is for the trier of fact to determine whether evidence offered in a particular case is clear, cogent, and convincing. In re Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 247 S.E.2d 778 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Standards on Review. - On appeal from an order of commitment, the questions for determination in the Court of Appeals become (1) whether the court's ultimate findings are indeed supported by the "facts" which the court recorded in its order as supporting
                        its findings, and (2) whether in any event there was competent evidence to support the court's findings. In re Hogan, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 232 S.E.2d 492 (1977).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Time for Hearing When Tenth Day Falls on Sunday. - Where the tenth day following the day the respondent was taken into custody was a Sunday, the hearing called for the following Monday was in apt time. In re Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite>                        344, 247 S.E.2d 778 (1978).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Denial of Right to Hearing Within 10 Days. - Where the trial court continued the respondent's hearing, over objection, for seven days, and the State failed at the originally scheduled hearing to offer any evidence or to come forward with even a copy of
                        the magistrate's order of commitment or the petition for involuntary commitment, the result was that respondent was denied his right to a hearing before the district court within 10 days of confinement. In re Jacobs,

                        to himself or others. In re Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980); In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 271 S.E.2d 72 (1980).

                        Trial court erred in involuntarily committing the respondent because, while the trial court's findings reflected the respondent's mental illness, there was no finding of the respondent suffering serious physical debilitation within the near future unless
                        adequate treatment was given or that there was a reasonable probability of suicide unless adequate treatment was given. In re J.P.S., <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 823 S.E.2d 917 (2019).

                    <p>
                        Trial court must find three elements present in order to find that respondent is dangerous to others: (1) within the recent past (2) respondent has (a) inflicted serious bodily harm on another, or (b) attempted to inflict serious bodily harm on another,
                        or (c) threatened to inflict serious bodily harm on another, or (d) has acted in such a manner as to create a substantial risk of serious bodily harm to another, and (3) there is a reasonable probability that such conduct will
                        be repeated. In re Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980).

                        Waiver of Right to Counsel. - Trial court's failure to comply with G.S. 15A-1242 and G.S. 122C-268(d) and Office of Indigent Defense Services Rule 1.6 made respondent's waiver of counsel ineffective as: (1) trial court did not make sure respondent was
                        acting with full awareness of respondent's rights, or consider respondent's age, education, mental condition, or the complexity of the proceeding; (2) trial court had evidence before it that respondent was mentally ill, and committed
                        respondent involuntarily; and (3) trial court deferred to respondent's counsel to provide respondent with constitutional safeguards. In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 706 S.E.2d

                        It is for the trier of fact to determine whether evidence offered in a particular case is clear, cogent, and convincing. In re Monroe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 270 S.E.2d 537 (1980).

                    <p>
                        The Court of Appeals does not consider whether the evidence of respondent's mental illness and dangerousness was clear, cogent and convincing. It is for the trier of fact to determine whether the competent evidence offered in a particular case met the
                        burden of proof. In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 271 S.E.2d 72 (1980).

                    <p>
                        The trier of fact alone must determine whether the evidence presented is clear, cogent and convincing. A court's only function on appeal is to determine whether there was any competent evidence to support the factual findings made. In re Medlin,

                    <p>
                        It is not the court's function on appeal to determine if the evidence offered meets the statutory standard but simply to determine whether there was any competent evidence to support the factual findings made. In re Jackson,

                        In its order the trial court must record the facts upon which its ultimate findings are based. In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C.

                        Denial of Gun Permit Not Warranted. - G.S. 14-404(c)(4) did not support the denial of a gun permit application to an applicant since the G.S. 122C-261(e), 122C-262, 122C-263, 122C-266, and 122C-268 requirements were not met, even though the applicant
                        was taken for an involuntary psychiatric examination when the applicant was 21 years old; neither inpatient nor outpatient commitment was recommended. Waldron v. Batten, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite>                        237, 662 S.E.2d 568 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Findings Sufficient to Support Commitment Order. - Respondent was dangerous to himself where the evidence showed that he was unable without constant professional 24 hour supervision and medical treatment to satisfy his needs for personal or medical care,
                        self-protection, and safety, he was grossly delusional, paranoid, and manic, he was likely to suffer debilitation without treatment, his loss of touch with reality made it difficult for him to exercise judgment in the conduct of
                        his daily affairs, and he was at risk of harm outside the medical facility. Thus, there was a reasonable probability that he would suffer imminent harm absent commitment. In re B.S., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. App.</cite>                        414, 840 S.E.2d 308 (2020).

                        Trial court did not err in entering an involuntary commitment order because it properly found that a patient was a danger to himself; the trial court's finding the patient's ACT team was unable to sufficiently care for his dental and nourishment needs
                        created the nexus between his mental illness and future harm to himself, and the trial court heard evidence of actions the patient was unable to control and of his severely impaired insight as to his own condition. In re C.G.,

                        Findings Insufficient to Support Commitment Order. - Involuntary commitment order was error because the order contained insufficient findings, as specifically required by G.S. 122C-268(j), to support the trial court's determination that the patient was
                        dangerous to himself and to others; statements in a physician's report, incorporated by the order, that the patient was a 56-year-old white male, with a history of alcohol abuse/dependence, admitted with manic episode, and who
                        continued to be symptomatic with limited insight regarding his illness, were not sufficient to support the trial court's findings. In re Booker, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 433, 667 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in committing respondent to involuntary inpatient commitment because the trial court simply checking a box on its locally modified involuntary commitment form indicating respondent met the requirements for further inpatient treatment
                        was insufficient and the trial court failed to make any findings of fact as required by G.S. 122C-268(j). In re Allison, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 715 S.E.2d 912 (2011).

                        Involuntary commitment of an individual under G.S. 122C-268(j) was improper because, even assuming that the trial court successfully incorporated the contents of the report by the individual's doctor into its order, the order was insufficient to support
                        the involuntary commitment because (1) the trial court's findings reflected the individual's mental illness, but they did not indicate that the individual's illness or any of the individual's symptoms would persist and endanger
                        the individual within the near future pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(a)(1); and (2) the trial court's findings were insufficient to support its conclusion that the individual was dangerous to others pursuant to G.S. 122C-3(11)(b).

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in ordering the involuntary commitment of the respondent because the evidence in the record on appeal was insufficient to satisfy the statutory criteria where there was no evidence that the respondent's refusal to take his medication
                        created a serious health risk in the near future, an expert's only testimony concerning the respondent's "nourishment" was that he lost some "unknown amount" of weight, but that his current weight was safe, and the respondent's
                        threat to sue his guardian and his alleged aggressive, but non-violent, actions toward the hospital staff could not be viewed as a threat to inflict "serious bodily harm." In re W.R.D., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite>                        512, 790 S.E.2d 344 (2016).

                    <p>
                        In its involuntary commitment order, the trial court's findings of fact were not sufficient because, even though the order incorporated the psychologist's report, it did not address conflicts in the evidence or resolve questions of credibility. The trial
                        court's findings did not address the hospital's witness's testimony at all and did not resolve any conflicts in the evidence presented by respondent's testimony. Respondent testified that she had lived alone for 20 years, was able
                        to care for herself, and that her daughter, who worked at the hospital where she was involuntarily committed, was working together with the hospital personnel to "permanently put her somewhere." In re J.C.D., - N.C. App. - , 828

                    <p>
                        Respondent's involuntary commitment was erroneous as the findings of fact did not support the trial court's conclusion that she was dangerous to herself because a physician's testimony showed that, as of the hearing date, respondent was stabilized, medicated,
                        and not suffering from any acute symptoms; although she had been a danger to herself in the past, that history alone could not support a finding that she would be a danger to herself in the future; her four psychiatric stays within
                        the past two years and her schizophrenia did not support the conclusion she would be a danger to herself within the near future; and there was no evidence that her refusal to take her medication created a serious health risk in
                        the near future. In re N.U., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. App.</cite> 427, 840 S.E.2d 296 (2020).

                        Alternative to Actual Transcript Provided Meaningful Review. - Patient was not deprived of the opportunity for meaningful appellate review of the patient's involuntary commitment hearing because the patient could not show prejudice by the absence of an
                        actual transcript of the hearing as the patient was able to obtain an adequate alternative through a memorandum provided by the judge which gave a detailed account of the testimony offered at the hearing that was supplemented by
                        the handwritten notes of the patient's counsel and the summary of the State of North Carolina's counsel concerning the hearing. In re Derrick Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 791 S.E.2d

        Right to Impartial Tribunal Not Violated.
       </b> - Trial court did not violate a patient's right to an impartial tribunal because it only elicited evidence that would otherwise be overlooked as no counsel for the State was present; because the court of appeals had
                        previously upheld involuntary commitments where the State has not appeared and where the trial court has questioned witnesses and elicited evidence, it was bound by its prior precedent to conclude the same. In re C.G., - N.C. App.

                        Standards on Review. - On appeal from an order of commitment, the questions for determination in the Court of Appeals become (1) whether the Court's ultimate findings are indeed supported by the "facts" which the Court recorded in its order as supporting
                        its findings, and (2) whether in any event there was competent evidence to support the Court's findings. In re Frick, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 271 S.E.2d 84 (1980).

                    <p>
                        On appeal of a commitment order, the function of the Court of Appeals is to determine whether there was any competent evidence to support the facts recorded in the commitment order and whether the trial court's ultimate findings of mental illness and
                        dangerous to self or others were supported by the facts recorded in the order. In re Collins, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 243, 271 S.E.2d 72 (1980).

                        judgment that defendant who was acquitted of multiple homicides by reason of insanity should not be released because he did not meet his burden of proving he no longer had a mental illness and was not dangerous. In re Hayes,

                        Conditional Release of Insanity Acquittee. - Trial court has authority to order a conditional release under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-277, because the pain language in G.S. 122C-277 indicates
                        that the General Assembly intended conditional release as a dispositional option in the insanity acquittee involuntary commitment context; construing the Act, G.S. 122C-268.1, G.S. 122C-276.1, and G.S. 122C-277 in pari materia,
                        it is reasonable to read these statutes as providing the same dispositional alternatives, recommitment, discharge, or conditional release, regardless whether the hearing was initiated by a respondent's treating physician or whether
                        it was automatically calendared pursuant to a statutory mandate, and if a trial court may order a conditional release when requested by a treating physician, then the trial court itself has commensurate authority under G.S. 122C-268.1
                        and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional release in an automatically calendared proceeding. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 803</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in recommitting a respondent who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity to involuntary inpatient treatment because the trial court, which was unaware that it had the option of conditionally releasing respondent, made its
                        findings of fact and conclusions of law under a misapprehension of the law, and since the trial court did not make findings of fact that there was a reasonable probability that respondent's seriously violent conduct would be repeated
                        and that he would be dangerous to others in the future in the absence of an unconditional release, the court of appeals could not determine that the trial court, if aware that a conditional release was a legal disposition, would
                        still have recommitted respondent; a trial court has authority following a hearing under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional
                        release of an insanity acquittee. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 803</cite>, 690 S.E.2d 694, 2010 N.C. LEXIS

                    Protection of Child's Rights. - Although a minor cannot obtain legal representation without the consent of the legally responsible person, the rights of the child can be adequately protected. First, the Department of Social Services can conduct an investigation
                    of the legally responsible person pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsXIa44s7A-542" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-542</a></cite> et seq.

                        Finding of Dangerousness. - By requiring that the person be found dangerous to herself or others, the legislature has made it clear that involuntary commitment is not for all those who are mentally ill, or even for those whose mental illness may make
                        it necessary for them to have custodial care. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628 (1978), decided under former statutory provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the doctor testified only that the respondent was unable to care for herself and that she was a complete nursing care problem, there was no showing that the respondent was dangerous to herself and the requirements for involuntary commitment were
                        not met. In re Doty, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 247 S.E.2d 628 (1978), decided under former statutory provisions.
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Court's Authority Limited If Defendant Found Not to Be Subject to Involuntary Commitment. - Superior court had no authority to enter order requiring Division of Adult Probation and Parole, without its consent, to provide supervision of defendant, who
                        had been determined incompetent to stand trial but not subject to involuntary commitment, while in custody of his former wife. State v. Gravette, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 114</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 856
                        (1990).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        In a case in which a trial court issued an order recommitting a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because his initial commitment order in 2007 provided
                        for a term of outpatient commitment that exceeded the period authorized by the governing statute, and the initial commitment period expired as a matter of law, the patient's appeal was an improper collateral attack on the 2007
                        commitment order. It was undisputed on appeal that the trial court's May 21, 2007 commitment order failed to comply with G.S. 122C-271(b), the patient failed to appeal from the initial order or request a supplemental hearing as
                        permitted by G.S. 122C-272. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                    <p>
                        In a case in which a trial court's order recommitted a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient argued that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, while he used the phrase subject matter jurisdiction,
                        he was actually arguing that the trial court did not have authority to order an 180-day commitment under G.S. 122C-271(b). There was no dispute that the trial court had authority to adjudicate the issues in dispute and had jurisdiction
                        over the parties, as a result, the trial court's May 21, 2007 order was not void, even if contrary to law; the trial court obtained jurisdiction over the civil commitment proceedings when the petition and affidavit were filed pursuant
                        to G.S. 122C-261. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                <p>
                    Judgment of the district court is final. Appeal may be had to the Court of Appeals by the State or by any party on the record as in civil cases. Appeal does not stay the commitment unless so ordered by the Court of Appeals. The Attorney General represents
                    the State's interest on appeal. The district court retains limited jurisdiction for the purpose of hearing all reviews, rehearings, or supplemental hearings allowed or required under this Part.

                    <p>
                        Appeal is not moot solely because period of commitment has expired. In re Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 215 S.E.2d 789 (1975), decided under former statutory provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Though respondent had been released, her appeal was not moot. So long as a judgment of involuntary commitment remains unchallenged, potentially adverse collateral consequences may continue. In re Carter, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite>                        442, 213 S.E.2d 409 (1975), decided under former statutory provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a patient's involuntary commitment period had expired, the patient's appeal was not moot given the possibility that the patient's commitment in the case might form the basis for a future commitment, along with other collateral legal consequences.
                        In re Derrick Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 791 S.E.2d 109 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Discharge on Challenge to Involuntary Commitment. - Discharge does not render questions challenging the involuntary commitment proceeding moot in view of the adverse consequences which could arise therefrom, including the possibility that the
                        commitment could form the basis of a future commitment. In re Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 244 S.E.2d 189 (1978), decided under former statutory provisions.
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to challenge the improper commitment period contained in the trial court's May 21, 2007 order, the patient was required to appeal that 2007 order pursuant to G.S. 122C-272 or to request a supplemental hearing under G.S. 122C-274(e). In re Webber,
                        <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a case in which a trial court issued an order recommitting a patient to a third 180-day period of involuntary outpatient treatment and the patient contended that the trial court lacked jurisdiction because his initial commitment order in 2007 provided
                        for a term of outpatient commitment that exceeded the period authorized by the governing statute, and the initial commitment period expired as a matter of law, the patient's appeal was an improper collateral attack on the 2007
                        commitment order. It was undisputed on appeal that the trial court's May 21, 2007 commitment order failed to comply with G.S. 122C-271(b), the patient failed to appeal from the initial order or request a supplemental hearing as
                        permitted by G.S. 122C-272. In re Webber, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 689 S.E.2d 468 (2009), cert. denied, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 504 (2010).

                        Alternative to Actual Transcript Provided Meaningful Review. - Patient was not deprived of the opportunity for meaningful appellate review of the patient's involuntary commitment hearing because the patient could not show prejudice by the absence of an
                        actual transcript of the hearing as the patient was able to obtain an adequate alternative through a memorandum provided by the judge which gave a detailed account of the testimony offered at the hearing that was supplemented by
                        the handwritten notes of the patient's counsel and the summary of the State of North Carolina's counsel concerning the hearing. In re Derrick Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 791 S.E.2d

        Petition for Writ of Certiorari Granted.
       </b> - In the absence of a properly filed notice of appeal, the court of appeals had no jurisdiction to consider a patient's appeal of an involuntary commitment order as of right; however, because the patient's counsel objected
                        to the proceedings and demonstrated the intent to appeal the trial court's order, and because involuntary commitment was a significant incursion to one's liberty interests, the court of appeals granted the patient's petition for
                        writ of certiorari and reviewed the order. In re C.G., - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 20, 2021).

                        The indeterminate commitment of any patient without periodic rehearings is clearly proscribed. In re Mikels, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 230 S.E.2d 155 (1976).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Findings Prerequisite to Commitment. - In order to support the recommitment of a respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding, the trial court must find by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the respondent is mentally ill or inebriate,
                        is dangerous to himself or others, and is in need of continued hospitalization. In re Mackie, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 244 S.E.2d 450 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Facts Must Be Found and Recorded. - The two ultimate facts of (1) mental illness or inebriety and (2) danger, must be supported by facts which are found from the evidence and recorded by the district court. In re Mackie,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 638, 244 S.E.2d 450 (1978).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The "words" imminently dangerous" in former section simply meant that a person posed a danger to himself or others in the immediate future. In re Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 237 S.E.2d 541 (1977).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Overt Acts. - An overt act may be clear, cogent and convincing evidence which will support a finding of danger, but it is not necessary that there be an overt act to establish imminent dangerousness. In re Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite>                        228, 237 S.E.2d 541 (1977).

                    <p>
                        Effect of G.S. 8-53. - For discussion of former statutory provisions making it manifest that the physician's role in involuntary commitment proceedings was not intended to be inhibited by G.S. 8-53, see In re Farrow, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite>                        680, 255 S.E.2d 777 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Disposition If Notice Is Insufficient. - The 15-day period of former G.S. 122-58.11 did not have the effect of a statute of limitations so as to necessitate dismissal of a proceeding brought on less notice. Dismissal was too drastic, and unless the respondent
                        could show some prejudice, the proper response would be to continue the proceeding until ample notice had been given. In re Boyles, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 247 S.E.2d 785, appeal dismissed,
                        <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 411</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 468 (1978).

                        Conditional Release of Insanity Acquittee. - Trial court has authority to order a conditional release under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-277, because the pain language in G.S. 122C-277 indicates
                        that the General Assembly intended conditional release as a dispositional option in the insanity acquittee involuntary commitment context; construing the Act, G.S. 122C-268.1, G.S. 122C-276.1, and G.S. 122C-277 in pari materia,
                        it is reasonable to read these statutes as providing the same dispositional alternatives, recommitment, discharge, or conditional release, regardless whether the hearing was initiated by a respondent's treating physician or whether
                        it was automatically calendared pursuant to a statutory mandate, and if a trial court may order a conditional release when requested by a treating physician, then the trial court itself has commensurate authority under G.S. 122C-268.1

                        Trial court erred in recommitting a respondent who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity to involuntary inpatient treatment because the trial court, which was unaware that it had the option of conditionally releasing respondent, made its
                        findings of fact and conclusions of law under a misapprehension of the law, and since the trial court did not make findings of fact that there was a reasonable probability that respondent's seriously violent conduct would be repeated
                        and that he would be dangerous to others in the future in the absence of an unconditional release, the court of appeals could not determine that the trial court, if aware that a conditional release was a legal disposition, would
                        still have recommitted respondent; a trial court has authority following a hearing under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-268.1 and G.S. 122C-276.1 to order a conditional
                        release of an insanity acquittee. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 681 S.E.2d 395 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 803</cite>, 690 S.E.2d 694, 2010 N.C. LEXIS

                        The trial court correctly found the appellant "dangerous to others," under this section and G.S. 122C-3(11), in spite of the appellant's objection that murders which happened 10 years in the past should not be considered because of their "remoteness,"
                        where, from both evidentiary and medical perspectives, the nature of his crimes was more important than their timing, and where the court's findings on his dangerousness were also rooted in additional evidence unrelated to his
                        prior crimes, including (1) his past and present mental illness, (2) his behavior since July 17, 1988 (including "slaw incident" during which he became upset and angry with his job supervisor over his co-worker's premature disposal
                        of coleslaw from the hospital grill where he was employed), and (3) his high likelihood of post-release relapse into multi-substance abuse, which all experts agreed was a trigger for his 1988 psychosis during which he killed four
                        people and wounded several others. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 532 S.E.2d 553 (2000).

                        Record supported trial court's judgment that defendant who was acquitted of multiple homicides by reason of insanity and was committed to a mental hospital did not meet his burden of proving he no longer had a mental illness and was not dangerous. In
                        re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 564 S.E.2d 305 (2002).

                        Appellate Review. - Because respondent, who was found not guilty of murder by reason of insanity, failed to present any argument to the trial court that conditional release was a dispositional alternative under the Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities,
                        and Substance Abuse Act of 1985, G.S. 122C-276.1, he failed to properly preserve the issue for appellate review; however, the court of appeals addressed the issue to prevent manifest injustice to respondent because the assumption
                        that the only alternative to recommitment was an unconditional release was a fundamental aspect of the State's argument for continued inpatient commitment and a critical component of the trial court's order, and the issue presented
                        by respondent's appeal would arise in every recommitment hearing of a person who had been committed by virtue of having been found not guilty by reason of insanity.

                        to control the respondent unless and until involuntary commitment is recommended; neither the examiner nor the facility owes a duty to third parties for harm resulting from an examiner's recommendation, even if the examination
                        failed to comply with statutory requirements. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C.

       § 122C-282. Special emergency procedure for violent individuals.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    When an individual subject to commitment under the provisions of this Part is also violent and requires restraint and when delay in taking the individual to a commitment examiner for examination would likely endanger life or property, a law enforcement
                    officer may take the person into custody and take him or her immediately before a magistrate or clerk. The law enforcement officer shall execute the affidavit required by G.S. 122C-281 and in addition shall swear that the respondent
                    is violent and requires restraint and that delay in taking the respondent to a commitment examiner for an examination would endanger life or property.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the clerk or magistrate finds by clear, cogent, and convincing evidence that the facts stated in the affidavit are true, that the respondent is in fact violent and requires restraint, and that delay in taking the respondent to a commitment examiner
                    for an examination would endanger life or property, the clerk or magistrate shall order the law enforcement officer to take the respondent directly to a 24-hour facility described in G.S. 122C-252.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Respondents received at a 24-hour facility under the provisions of this section shall be examined and processed thereafter in the same way as all other respondents under this Part.

                    initial (first-level) examinations of individuals meeting the criteria of G.S. 122C-261(a) or G.S. 122C-281(a). The waiver shall be implemented on a pilot-program basis. The request from the LME shall specifically describe:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "a. How the purpose of the statutory requirement would be better served by waiving the requirement and substituting the proposed change under the waiver.

                <p>
                    "a. The request meets the requirements of this section.

                    "c. The request improves the delivery of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services in the counties affected by the waiver and also protects the health, safety, and welfare of individuals receiving these services.

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The Secretary shall evaluate the effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services and protection of health, safety, and welfare under the waiver. The Secretary shall send a report on
                    the evaluation to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substances Abuse Services by October 1, 2009. The report shall include data gathered from all participating LMEs since the
                    beginning of the pilot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) The waiver granted by the Secretary under this section shall be in effect until October 1, 2012.
                </p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) In no event shall the substitution of a licensed clinical social worker, masters level psychiatric nurse, or masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist under a waiver granted under this section be construed as authorization to expand the
                    scope of practice of the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist.
                </p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    "a. How the purpose of the statutory requirement would be better served by waiving the requirement and substituting the proposed change under the waiver.

                </p>
                <p>
                    "c. The request improves the delivery of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services in the counties affected by the waiver and also protects the health, safety, and welfare of individuals receiving these services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "d. The duties and responsibilities performed by the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist are within the individual's scope of practice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The Secretary shall evaluate the effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services and protection of health, safety, and welfare under the waiver. The Secretary shall send a report on
                    the evaluation to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substances Abuse Services by October 1, 2009. The report shall include data gathered from all participating LMEs since the
                    beginning of the pilot.

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) In no event shall the substitution of a licensed clinical social worker, masters level psychiatric nurse, or masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist under a waiver granted under this section be construed as authorization to expand the
                    scope of practice of the licensed clinical social worker, the masters level psychiatric nurse, or the masters level licensed clinical addictions specialist.
                </p>

                        Physical Presence of Person to Be Examined Required. - "Examine" requires that the person to be examined be physically in the presence of the qualified physician, so that the physician may actually utilize his five senses, or such of them as he deems
                        necessary, in carrying out the mandate of this section. McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290

                        The requirement that the law-enforcement officer must take and present the person to be examined to the physician requires that the person must be physically present before the physician for the purpose of the examination. McLean v. Sale,

                            class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 703 (1982).

                        Relief from Wrongful Certification. - A physician's failure to perform an examination prior to signing certificate is a violation of the statute, and if plaintiff is involuntarily committed as a result of defendant's actions, a cause of action arises
                        against defendant, and this is true regardless of what may have prompted defendant to fail to make the examination of plaintiff. McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d
                        160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 703 (1982).

                        Custody. - McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981)Following a first examination, custody continues with law enforcement until the respondent is transferred to a 24-hour facility for
                        the custody and treatment of involuntary clients, or, in cases where commitment is not recommended, returned to a residence and released from custody; the legislature has not seen fit to confer custody of an involuntary commitment
                        respondent on anyone other than law enforcement or other person properly designated prior to and during a first examination. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017),

                    <p>
                        Relevance of Reasons for Failing to Examine. - The reasons defendant physician failed to make the required examination prior to signing certificate were competent on the question of punitive damages, but not on the issue of whether defendant violated
                        his statutory duty to plaintiff. McLean v. Sale, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 284 S.E.2d 160 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 301</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 703 (1982).

                    <p>
                        No Special Relationship Imposed Liability. - Trial court did not commit reversible error in dismissing a family's negligence complaint because healthcare providers did not have custody of or a legal right to control a patient when conducting their first
                        examination, and thus, no special relationship was created imposing liability; the county sheriff's department assumed custody of the patient until he was delivered to a 24-hour facility or transported to his home or the home of
                        a consenting individual. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 959 (N.C. 2017).

                    <p>
                        No Duty to Third Parties. - When a respondent in an involuntary commitment proceeding is delivered to a hospital for an initial examination to recommend whether commitment is required, neither the examiner nor the hospital obtains custody or a legal right
                        to control the respondent unless and until involuntary commitment is recommended; neither the examiner nor the facility owes a duty to third parties for harm resulting from an examiner's recommendation, even if the examination
                        failed to comply with statutory requirements. McArdle v. Mission Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 804 S.E.2d 214 (2017), review denied, mot. granted, 807 S.E.2d 150, 2017 N.C.

                    and employees of the jail are exempt from liability as provided in G.S. 122C-301(b). The intoxicated individual may be detained at the jail only until he becomes sober or a maximum of 24 hours and may be released at any time to a relative
                    or other individual willing to be responsible for his care.

                    <p>
                        The party states find that the proper and expeditious treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient can be facilitated by cooperative action, to the benefit of the patients, their families, and society as a whole. Further, the party states find
                        that the necessity of and desirability for furnishing such care and treatment bears no primary relation to the residence or citizenship of the patient but, that, on the contrary, the controlling factors of community safety and
                        humanitarianism require that facilities and services be made available for all who are in need of them. Consequently, it is the purpose of this Compact and of the party states to provide the necessary legal basis for the institutionalization
                        or other appropriate care and treatment of the mentally ill and mentally deficient under a system that recognizes the paramount importance of patient welfare and to establish the responsibilities of the party states in term of
                        such welfare.

                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1999-140, s. 1, provides that the Camp Butner reservation and the Community of Butner, as regulated by Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes, is a unique State resource that is and should continue to be administered by the State of North Carolina through the Office of the Secretary of Health and Human Services. There is a resident population in the
                    Community of Butner that does not have elected representation with respect to public services, such as police and fire protection, and the provision of water and sewers, that would normally be under the control of an elected city council
                    or board of county commissioners. The citizens of the Camp Butner reservation should be permitted to elect a representative body to act as the voice of the affected people of Butner with regard to the provision of public services and
                    planning for the future of the Camp Butner reservation.

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) The Camp Butner reservation is administered by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter 'Secretary') in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes (the Camp Butner reservation is variously referred to, in whole or in part, as the Camp Butner reservation, the Town of Butner, and the Community of Butner and in this act shall be referred to as the 'Butner

                <p>
                    "(2) The Department of Health and Human Services (hereinafter 'Department') has long operated the Town of Butner with the Secretary or the Secretary's designee acting as the de facto mayor of the Town of Butner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The operation of the Town of Butner is not a core function of the Department, and the Department's mission would not be negatively impacted by the incorporation of the Town of Butner.

                <p>
                    "(4) The utilities were transferred to the South Granville Water and Sewer Authority ('SGWASA') pursuant to the provisions of Session Law 2006-159 which also provides that SGWASA shall pay to the Department a sum, indexed to inflation, as set out in that
                    legislation to support the operations of the Butner Reservation including the Town of Butner.
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>

                <p>
                    "(7) Certain personal property has been purchased by the Department for use in operating the Butner Reservation and that personal property traditionally used primarily for the benefit of the portion of the Butner Reservation to be incorporated should

                    Session Laws 2007-269, s. 2, provides: "The incorporation of the Town of Butner by Section 1 of this act and the remaining provisions of this act satisfy the requirement of Section 2(c) of Session Law 2006-159 that the majority of the functions of the
                    Department performed at the Butner Reservation are assumed by a municipal corporation organized pursuant to the laws of the State of North Carolina."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2007-269, s. 14.1, provides: "Section 1.1 through 14 of this act shall become effective only if the Charter of the Town of Butner is approved under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965; provided, however, that if the Charter is not

                    of the intersection of Rural Paved Roads 1103 and 1106 and bounded by those roads and the boundaries of said reservation and said sanitary district, provided, however, that those portions of said lands within the corporate limits of

                    of Butner that does not have elected representation with respect to public services, such as police and fire protection, and the provision of water and sewers, that would normally be under the control of an elected city council or
                    board of county commissioners. The citizens of the Camp Butner reservation should be permitted to elect a representative body to act as the voice of the affected people of Butner with regard to the provision of public services and
                    planning for the future of the Camp Butner reservation.

Since this act will become effective after July 1, 2007, with respect to taxes on property located within the corporate limits, for taxes levied for the 2007-2008 fiscal year, if the incorporation
                    becomes effective, Granville County shall remit to the Town of Butner rather than to the State General Fund the taxes collected for that district on properties located within the corporate limits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence,
                    if Granville County does not bill the Butner Police and Fire Protection District tax for fiscal year 2007-2008 on properties located within the proposed corporate limits until either the incorporation is either precleared or rejected
                    under Section 5, those taxes are released or refunded if the incorporation is precleared, or shall be billed if the incorporation is rejected."
