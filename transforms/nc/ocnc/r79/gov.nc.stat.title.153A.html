                    The provisions of this Chapter, insofar as they are the same in substance as laws in effect as of December 31, 1973, are intended to continue those laws in effect and not to be new enactments. The enactment of this Chapter does not require the readoption
                    of any county or city ordinance adopted pursuant to laws that were in effect as of December 31, 1973, and that are restated or revised in this Chapter. The provisions of this Chapter do not affect any act heretofore done, any liability
                    incurred, any right accrued or vested, or any suit or prosecution begun or cause of action accrued as of January 1, 1974.

                        County Exceeded Statutory Authority With Regard to Zoning Regulations for Manufactured Homes. - County exceeded the power the general assembly conferred upon it with regard to zoning regulations for manufactured homes because an ordinance, as amended,
                        did not employ appearance and dimensional criteria as intended in G.S. 153A-341.1 and G.S. 160A-383.1 when the intent of the ordinance was to increase the tax base by the elimination of housing that rapidly depreciated in value,
                        and that wealth based criterion was neither an appearance nor dimensional criteria; G.S. 160A-383.1, as made applicable to counties by G.S. 153A-341.1, limits a county's power to enact zoning regulations for manufactured homes,

                            Counties Are Bodies Politic and Corporate. - Counties are bodies politic and corporate, which may exercise as agents for the State only such powers as are prescribed by statute and those which are necessarily implied therefrom by law, essential to the
                            exercise of the powers specifically conferred. O'Neal v. Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 184</cite>, 145 S.E. 28 (1928). See also, Board of Comm'rs v. Hanchett Bond Co., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 137</cite>,

                            Counties Are Part of the State Government. - Counties are of, and constitute a part of, the State government. Their chief purpose is to establish its political organization, and effectuate the local civil administration of its powers and authority. They
                            are in their general nature governmental - mere instrumentalities of government - and possess corporate powers adapted to its purposes. It is not their purpose to create civil liability on their part, and become answerable
                            to individuals civilly or otherwise. Manuel v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 9</cite>, 3 S.E. 829 (1887), citing White v.

                            By Art. VII of the Constitution of 1868, counties were regarded as municipal corporations. Winslow v.

                            Counties are not, in a strictly legal sense, municipal corporations, like cities and towns. Their purposes are more general and partake more largely of the purposes and powers of government proper. Manuel v. Board of Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 9</cite>, 3 S.E. 829 (1887); Bell v. Commissioners of Johnston County, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 85</cite>, 37 S.E. 136 (1900); Martin v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 354</cite>,

                            The powers of the legislature over counties are very broad and far-reaching, giving to it practically full control of them. Jones v. Commissioners, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 579</cite>, 50 S.E. 291 (1905); Woodall v. Western
                            Wake Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 377</cite>, 97 S.E. 226 (1918).

                            Legislature May Create Counties and Invest Them with Powers. - It is within the power of the legislature to subdivide the territory of the State and invest the inhabitants of such subdivisions with corporate functions, more or less extensive and varied
                            in their character, for the purpose of government. The legislature alone can create counties, directly or indirectly, and invest them, and agencies in them, with powers, corporate or otherwise in their nature, to effectuate
                            the purposes of the government, whether these be local or general, or both. Such organizations are intended to be instrumentalities and agencies employed to aid in the administration of the government, and are always under
                            the control of the power that created them unless the same shall be restricted by some constitutional limitations. McCormac v. Commissioners of Robeson, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 441</cite> (1884);
                            Board of Trustees v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. 379</cite>, 71 S.E. 520 (1911); Commissioners of Cumberland County v. Commissioners of Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 517</cite>, 73 S.E. 195 (1911);

                        <p>
                            Imposing Liability on Counties. - The legislature, subject to constitutional limitations, may confer upon counties such corporate powers to make contracts, create civil liabilities, and serve such business purposes, as it may deem expedient and wise,
                            and may make them answerable in damages for the negligence of their officers and agents in failing to properly exercise the powers with which they are charged, or for exercising them improperly, to the injury of individuals.
                            But such corporate authority and liability must be especially created by and appear from statutory provision, expressed in terms or necessarily implied. Manuel v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 9</cite>,
                            3 S.E. 829 (1887).

                        <p>
                            Legislature May Enlarge, Abridge or Modify Counties' Functions. - The functions of counties are not always the same, and they may be enlarged, abridged or modified at the will of the legislature. White v. Commissioners of Chowan,
                            <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 437</cite> (1884).

                            As Well as Alter or Abolish Counties. - Counties are legislative creations and subject to be changed, even abolished, or divided and subdivided, at the will of the General Assembly. Jones v. Commissioners, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 59</cite>,
                            55 S.E. 427 (1906); Board of Trustees v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. 379</cite>, 71 S.E. 520 (1911); Woodall v. Western Wake Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 377</cite>, 97 S.E. 226 (1918).

                            Supervisory Control of Boards of Commissioners. - Under the Constitution and public laws of North Carolina, the boards of county commissioners are generally given supervision and control of governmental matters in the several counties. Bunch v. Commissioners
                            of Randolph County, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. 335</cite>, 74 S.E. 1048 (1912).

                            County Must Act Through Commissioners Convened in a Legal Session. - For a county to exercise its power to contract, it is essential that it act through its county commissioners as a body convened in legal session, regular, adjourned or special, and,
                            as a rule, authorized meetings are prerequisite to corporate action, which should be based upon deliberate conference and intelligent discussion of proposed measures. O'Neal v. Wake County,

                        boundary as established in accordance with law. Upon receiving written request from all counties adjacent to the uncertain or disputed boundary, the NCGS may cause the boundary to be surveyed, marked, and mapped. The counties may
                        appoint special commissioners to supervise the surveying, marking, and mapping. A commissioner so appointed or a person surveying or marking the boundary may enter upon private property to view and survey the boundary or to erect
                        boundary markers. Upon ratification of the survey by the board of commissioners of each county, a map showing the surveyed boundary shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of each county in the manner provided

                        real property has been placed in whole or in part in another county due to the reestablished boundary.

                    a preliminary resurvey and present a proposed map for consideration by both counties. During the 160 years since the 1849 survey, the exact location of the surveyed line has become uncertain, resulting in unintentional modifications

                    Session Laws 2010-61, s. 3, as amended by Session Laws 2011-88, s. 3, provides: "In the 160 years since the initial survey of the Alamance County/Orange County boundary line, Alamance and Orange Counties have entered into multiple taxing agreements that
                    have resulted in properties being taxed in one county by the adjoining county. Other situations have arisen in which children of one county attend school in the adjoining county and voters in one county have voted in the adjoining
                    county. The General Assembly recognizes the difficulties in addressing these issues and authorizes Alamance County and Orange County to maintain the current taxing, elections, education, and any other recognized government functions
                    in place until July 1, 2012."

                        the board shall appoint enough members to make up a quorum, and the board shall then proceed to fill the remaining vacancies. If the number of vacancies on the board is such that a quorum of the board cannot be obtained and the
                        office of chairman is vacant, the clerk of superior court of the county shall fill the vacancies upon the request of any remaining member of the board or upon the petition of any five registered voters of the county. If for any

                        to fill the vacancy is for the remainder of the unexpired term. Otherwise, the term of the person appointed to fill the vacancy extends to the first Monday in December next following the first general election for county commissioner
                        held more than 60 days after the day the vacancy occurs; at that general election, a person shall be elected to the seat vacated, either to the remainder of the unexpired term or, if the term has expired, to a full term.

                        member being replaced, if the county is divided into electoral districts. The board of commissioners or the clerk of superior court, as the case may be, shall consult the county executive committee of the appropriate political

        Authority to Accept Resignation.

                        superior court was a tender to the proper authority. While the mere filing of the resignation did not vacate the office, its acceptance by the clerk was final, and after its acceptance the commissioner had no power to withdraw

                        Powers of Board of Commissioners. - The board of commissioners in a county possesses only those powers which have been prescribed by statute and those necessarily implied by law, and no others. This is the general rule. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. Fleming,
                        <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 332</cite>, 43 S.E. 899 (1903).

                        Powers to Be Exercised by Majority. - A majority of the commissioners constitute the legal body, and generally a majority of the members of the legally organized body can exercise the powers delegated to the county. Cleveland Cotton Mills v. Commissioners
                        of Cleveland County, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 678</cite>, 13 S.E. 271 (1891).

                    <p>
                        Remedy for Failure of Board to Act on Claim. - If the board of commissioners refuses to audit or act upon a claim, mandamus will lie to compel them to do so. If after a hearing the board refuses to allow or issue a warrant for its payment, an action will
                        lie against the commissioners to establish the debt and for such other relief as the party may be entitled to. Reed v. Farmer, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 249</cite>, 189 S.E. 882 (1937), citing Martin
                        v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 178</cite>, 47 S.E. 397 (1904).

                        Who Must Obey Mandamus When Membership of Board Changes Between Order and Service Thereof. - When a writ of mandamus is obtained against a board of commissioners, and there is a change in the individual members between the time when the writ is ordered
                        and the time when it is served, those who compose the board at the time of service must obey it. Pegram v. Commissioners of Cleveland County, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 114</cite> (1871).

                    <p>
                        Correction of Clerical Error in Record by Board. - Where the record of the board of county commissioners, through a clerical error, stated that a twenty cents (20
                        <span class="s2">
    ›
   </span> ) tax levy for general county purposes was on $100.00 valuation of property, this error could subsequently be corrected by the board, at its own instance, to correctly show that in fact the levy was actually made for
                        15 cents for general county purposes, 5 cents thereof being for the improvement of the courthouse and county home, and thus within the constitutional requirement. Norfolk S.R.R. v. Forbes, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 151</cite>,
                        124 S.E. 132 (1924).

                        A court has no power to interfere with the domestic administration of affairs of a county, so long as the board of commissioners acts intra vires. Long v. Commissioners of Richmond County, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 273</cite>                        (1877).

                        Personal Liability of Commissioners as Imposed by Legislature. - Where the legislature has created certain duties to be performed by county commissioners, and has expressly imposed a personal liability upon their failure to perform some of them but not
                        others, such liability only attaches where it is expressly so declared. Fore v. Feimster, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 551</cite>, 88 S.E. 977 (1916).

                    <p>
                        Personal Liability for Negligent Performance or Omission of Ministerial Duties. - County commissioners are held to an individual liability in the negligent performance of, or negligent omission to perform, a purely ministerial duty, to a person specially
                        injured thereby, when the means to act are available and the matter does not involve the exercise of a discretionary or judicial power conferred upon them by statute. Hipp v. Farrell, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 551</cite>,
                        86 S.E. 570 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Personal Liability for Judicial and Discretionary Acts. - Public officers are not personally liable to persons specially injured by their acts done in the exercise of judicial or discretionary powers conferred on them by statute, unless it is alleged
                        and shown that in doing the acts complained of they did so corruptly and with malice. Hipp v. Farrell, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 551</cite>, 86 S.E. 570 (1915).

                    the board of commissioners shall choose one of its members as chairman for the ensuing year, unless the chairman is elected as such by the people or otherwise designated by law. The board shall also at that time choose a vice-chairman to act in the absence

                    The chairman is the presiding officer of the board of commissioners. Unless excused by rule of the board, the presiding officer has the duty to vote on any question before the board, but he has no right to break a tie vote in which he participated.

                        Statute setting days for meetings was directory and was intended to forbid commissioners from receiving compensation for attendance on days other than those of regular meetings. It did not disable the commissioners from acting at other times on due notice

       No Conflict of Interest Found.

                    commissioners regarding the approval or disapproval of that budget, as the budget for the department of social services would not ordinarily involve an economic conflict of interest. See opinion of Attorney General to C. Preston Cornelius,

                    The chairman of the county social services board, who is also a county commissioner, can participate in discussions and vote at county commission meetings in matters pertaining to personnel and the operation of the county department of social services.
                    It is apparent that the legislature contemplates county commissioners serving on other boards and commissions as an extension of commissioner duties, and that such service will not ordinarily disqualify the commissioners from participating

                        that he was a taxpayer, failed to assert a traceable, concrete, and particularized injury resulting from the transfer of a 500 acre tract of land between the parties named in his complaint, failed to set facts to support his claim

        County Board of Health.
       </b> - Pursuant to this section, a board of commissioners, in a county with a population in excess of 325,000 (now 425,000), may assume all powers, responsibilities and duties of a county board of health. The board may exercise
                        the power and authority after conducting a public hearing pursuant to 30 days' notice. Although the board may appoint advisory groups, the statute does not authorize the delegation of the former power and authority of the county

                        services, and similar agencies. The office of local health director is unaffected by this section and must be filled by the board of commissioners. See opinion of Attorney General to Dr. Ronald H. Levine, State Health Director,

                        Severance Pay. - The right of a public officer to receive compensation can only arise out of the rendition of the public services related to his office. Leete v. County of Warren, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 116</cite>, 462

                        Where county manager worked one month after giving notice of his resignation and received all compensation due him under the terms of his employment with the County, severance pay would be compensation beyond that due for services rendered and, thus,
                        constitutionally impermissible. Leete v. County of Warren, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 116</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 476 (1995).

                        Assistant Registers of Deeds. - Employees of the register of deeds are not persons employed by a county or any department or program thereof, and in light of the statute's plain language and analogous case law concerning deputy sheriffs an assistant register
                        of deeds, appointed by and working at the pleasure of the elected register of deeds, is not a county employee within the meaning of the statute. Sims-Campbell v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite>                        503, 769 S.E.2d 643 (2015).

                        Deputy Sheriff. - Plaintiff, a deputy sheriff, was not a county employee as defined in G.S. 153A-99, and could be discharged based upon political conduct without violating her free speech rights under N.C. Const. art. I,

                    <p>
                        In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is not a county employee. Young v. Bailey,
                        <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Deputy sheriff was not entitled to the protections provided in the statute and was not terminated in violation of public policy because the deputy was not a county employee. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>,
                        781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

                    <p>
                        County Sheriff's Employees Not Covered by Statute. - Former sheriff's employees, including a deputy sheriff, were not "county employees" as defined in G.S. 153A-99 and, thus, were not entitled to the protections of that statute. Because this statute was
                        the basis of the employees' claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy, this argument was without merit. McLaughlin v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 771 S.E.2d
                        570 (2015), appeal, dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 284</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 835, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 713 (2015), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 618</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 23, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 28 (2016).

                        Summary Judgment Granted in Retaliatory Discharge Case. - In the former deputy sheriff's retaliatory discharge in violation of G.S. 153A-99 cause of action against the sheriff and the surety, the sheriff and surety were entitled to summary judgment pursuant
                        to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 56; the former deputy's assertion that the former deputy was fired due to the former
                        deputy's affiliation with the sheriff's primary election foe was insufficient to establish a nexus between the protected activity and the discharge, because the evidence of the nexus was from the former deputy's deposition testimony
                        that amounted to mere conjecture. Venable v. Vernon, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 702, 592 S.E.2d 256 (2004).

                        The legislature may confer upon a county the power to create debts for necessary expenses, without the approval of a majority of the qualified voters in the county. Evans v. Commissioners of Cumberland, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 154</cite>                        (1883).

                        Necessity of Expense to Be Determined by Commissioners. - What is a "necessary expense" for a county is to be determined by the sound judgment and discretion of its board of commissioners. Broadnax v. Groom, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 244</cite>                        (1870); Commissioners of Yancey County v.

                        If the entire fund which can be raised by taxation is required to meet necessary expenses of an economical administration of the county government, and none can be diverted to pay its indebtedness without serious detriment to the public, none ought to
                        be thus appropriated. Cromartie v. Commissioners of Bladen, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 211</cite> (1881).

                        Sheriff Not Liable for County's Salary Administration. - Because there was absolutely no evidence that defendant sheriff "acted in concert" with defendant county, as alleged, or had anything to do with the administration of plaintiffs' salaries, he was
                        an unnecessary party to their case. Hubbard v. County of Cumberland, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 544 S.E.2d 587, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 69</cite>, 553 S.E.2d 40

                        Employee of Sheriff Held Not an Employee of the County. - Plaintiff's argument that even though she was hired by the sheriff, she remained the employee of the county, and that thus all the protections and privileges provided by the Board of Commissioners
                        to other county employees should have been afforded her, was without merit. Peele v. Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 368 S.E.2d 892, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 366</cite>,

                        Deputy Sheriff Not County Employee. - In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is
                        not a county employee. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

                        Because, pursuant to this section, sheriff/defendant, and not the county, had exclusive responsibility for discharging plaintiff/jailer (who claimed the discharge was retaliatory), the district court properly granted summary judgment for the county on

                        thus, the sheriff, rather than the department or associated county, could be held liable for employment law violations within the department. Efird v. Riley, 342 F. Supp. 2d 413 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

                        The fact that North Carolina has established a generous pension system for its public employees as part of its compensatory and incentive package does not confer upon those employees a property interest in continued employment; the programs are merely

                        Employee Was an At-Will Employee. - Employee failed to state a claim for wrongful termination in violation of public policy as the employee was an at-will employee under G.S. 153A-103(1), and the employee did not meet a heightened pleading standing by
                        alleging a violation of any "explicit statutory or constitutional provision" or that a sheriff encouraged the employee to violate any law that might result in potential harm to the public. Gillis v. Montgomery County Sheriff's

                        Where a sheriff filed a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion as to a former deputy's state wrongful termination claim, the complaint made clear that the deputy's term of employment expired with sheriff's term of office, and the sheriff's decision not to reappoint
                        him did not amount to wrongful termination. Randleman v. Johnson, 162 F. Supp. 3d 482 (M.D.N.C., 2016).

                    <p>
                        Termination for Political Reasons. - Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be
                        lawfully terminated for political reasons under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary
                        to ensure that the sheriff's policies are carried out. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

                        Discharge of Sheriff's Employees Based Upon Political Matters. - Deputy sheriff was discharged based upon political conduct without violating free speech rights. Dismissal of another employee's claim for violation of the employee's rights to free speech
                        was appropriate because the sheriff produced evidence that the employee was discharged for failure to comply with the sheriff's department rules and policies, and the employee failed to produce specific evidence that the employee's
                        discharge was politically motivated. McLaughlin v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 771 S.E.2d 570 (2015), appeal, dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 284</cite>, 775 S.E.2d

                        Ordinance Upheld. - County ordinance which regulated the location of adult and sexually oriented businesses (but did not prohibit them) for the stated purpose of promoting the health, safety and morals and general welfare of the citizenry of the county
                        was well within the parameters of this section. Maynor v. Onslow County, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 488 S.E.2d 289, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 268</cite>, 493 S.E.2d

                        The enactment of the Sign Control Ordinance of Transylvania County, North Carolina, was a valid exercise of the general police power of Transylvania County, North Carolina, under G.S. 153A-121, and, therefore, Transylvania County did not have to follow
                        the enactment procedures of ch. 153A, art. 18 in enacting the ordinance. Transylvania County v. Moody, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 565 S.E.2d 720 (2002).

                        Former G.S. 153-9(55) Was a Home Rule Statute. - Former G.S. 153-9(55), authorizing boards of county commissioners to adopt ordinances for the better government of the county, was a Home Rule statute, applicable throughout the State. It enabled the county
                        commissioners of every county to enact ordinances in the exercise of the general police power within the prescribed territory, just as other statutes enable the governing bodies of cities and towns to enact ordinances in the exercise
                        of the general police powers within their corporate limits. Whitney Stores, Inc. v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 322</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 418 (1970).

                        Statute was General Law. - Former G.S. 153-9(55) was a general law and therefore did not contravene N.C. Const. 1868, Art. II,

                        Conferring General Police Powers. - Former G.S. 153-9(55) did not confer or withhold authority in respect of specific activities; on the contrary, it conferred authority to enact ordinances in the exercise of the general police power. In this respect,
                        the statute was similar to the statutes which confer general police power upon cities and towns. Whitney Stores, Inc. v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 322</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 418 (1970); State v.

                        Same Power as That Conferred Upon Cities and Towns. - The authority conferred by former G.S. 153-9(55) upon the boards of commissioners of the respective counties was the same as that conferred upon cities and towns by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa08s160A-174" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-174</a></cite>                        and 160A-181.

                        County Cannot Enact Its Own Employment Discrimination Ordinance. - G.S. 153A-121 did not empower a county to enact its own employment discrimination ordinance, as the county only possessed those powers validly delegated to it by the State, and the State's
                        attempted delegation of this power to the county violated N.C. Const., Art. II,

                        Regulation of Signs Held Constitutional. - The off-premise/on-premise classification is a constitutionally valid basis for regulation of outdoor advertising signs. Summey Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. County of Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite>                        533, 386 S.E.2d 439 (1989).

                        County ordinance regulating off-premises signs larger than 15 square feet held to meet the constitutional requirements of due process. Summey Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. County of Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite>                        533, 386 S.E.2d 439 (1989).

                        Regulation of Signs Did Not Constitute a Taking. - Five year amortization provisions of county ordinance regulating off-premises signs of over 15 square feet were sufficient, and the ordinance did not constitute a taking of plaintiff's property without
                        compensation. Summey Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. County of Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 533, 386 S.E.2d 439 (1989).

                        Legislative Authority of County Board of Commissioners. - A county board of commissioners has no legislative authority not granted to it expressly or by necessary implication from expressly granted powers. State v. Tenore,
                        <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 238</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 644 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Power of General Assembly to Delegate Authority to County Boards. - Subject to constitutional limitations, the power of the General Assembly to delegate to county commissioners the authority to adopt ordinances in the lawful exercise of the police power
                        is well established. Whitney Stores, Inc. v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 322</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 418 (1970).

                        Courts Are Not Concerned with Motives, Wisdom or Expediency of Board's Acts. - If the board of commissioners does not exceed its delegated or constitutional authority, the courts are not concerned with the motives, wisdom or expediency which prompt its
                        actions. Whitney Stores, Inc. v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 322</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 418 (1970).

                    <p>
                        When the most that can be said against an ordinance is that it is fairly debatable whether it is an unreasonable, arbitrary or unequal exercise of power, the courts will not interfere. County of Hoke v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite>                        658, 421 S.E.2d 800 (1992).

                    <p>
                        Ordinance May Not Forbid Conduct Dealt with by Statute. - The board of commissioners of a county cannot enact a valid ordinance forbidding certain conduct if a statewide statute in effect at the time the ordinance in question is adopted deals specifically
                        with the identical conduct. State v. Tenore, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 238</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 644 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Repeal of Statute Does Not Breathe Life into Ordinance. - The repeal of a statewide law which, during its life, prohibited the enactment of a county ordinance, is prospective and does not breathe life into an ordinance which was beyond the authority of
                        the ordaining body when it was adopted. State v. Tenore, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 238</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 644 (1972).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        A county's zoning authority is limited: it can be applied only to buildings within the county's borders which are outside city limits, and it is confined to the purposes of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare. Davidson County v. City
                        of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 252</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 553 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Authority to Regulate the Development of Real Estate. - County correctly tied an Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) to its zoning and subdivision regulation authority, and G.S. 153A-121 did not provide an independent source of authority for the
                        APFO because the General Assembly enacted zoning and subdivision regulation statutes for the purposes of delineating the authority of county governments to regulate the development of real estate. Union Land Owners Ass'n v. County
                        of Union, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 689 S.E.2d 504 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Right of County to Proscribe Obscenity Which Is Not Forbidden by State Law. - Nothing in G.S. 14-190.1 through 14-190.9, statewide laws relating to obscene literature and exhibitions and to indecent exposure, expresses or indicates an intent by the General
                        Assembly to preclude cities and towns or counties from enacting and enforcing ordinances requiring a higher standard of conduct or condition within their respective jurisdictions. State v. Tenore,
                        <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 238</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 644 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Authority to Regulate Signs. - Fact that defendant county had authority to regulate signs under the zoning power in G.S. 153A-340 did not mean that it could not regulate signs in a similar manner under the general police powers in this section, allowing
                        regulation of "conditions detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of its citizens and the peace and dignity of the county." Summey Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. County of Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite>                        533, 386 S.E.2d 439 (1989).

                    <p>
                        County's moratorium on outdoor advertising signs did not require a notice or a public hearing prior to passage, as it was enacted pursuant to the county's general police powers, and a property owner did not have a statutory vested right to erect a sign.

                        Defendant county's ordinance regulating off-premises signs larger than 15 square feet was well within the parameters of this section; while it might have been more desirable and better planning for defendant county to adopt a county-wide zoning ordinance,
                        the fact that defendant did not do so did not preclude it from regulating outdoor advertising signs under this section. Summey Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. County of Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite>                        533, 386 S.E.2d 439 (1989).

                        Authority for County Ordinance Concerning Drive-In Theaters. - Former G.S. 153-9(55) provided plenary authority for enacting a county ordinance making it unlawful to operate a drive-in motion picture theater near streets or highways in such a manner that
                        the screen is visible to passing motorists. Variety Theaters, Inc. v. Cleveland County, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 272</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 290 (1972), appeal dismissed, 411 U.S. 911, 93 S. Ct. 1548, 36

                        Authority to Regulate Location of Adult and Sexually Oriented Businesses. - Failure of a county to adopt a county-wide comprehensive zoning plan did not preclude it from regulating the location of adult and sexually oriented businesses pursuant to its
                        police powers. Onslow County v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 499 S.E.2d 780 (1998).

                    <p>
                        Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses. - County's amended ordinance requiring the licensure and other conditions of sexually oriented businesses was a civil regulatory law that did not violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution.

                        Authority for County Ordinance Concerning Collection and Disposal of Solid Waste. - County governments are delegated by the State with a general police power. Additionally, counties are specifically vested by statute with authority to regulate by ordinance
                        the collection and disposal of solid waste within their jurisdictions. In order to effect this regulatory power and meet their police power responsibilities, counties are specifically authorized by statute to enact ordinances granting
                        exclusive franchises to commercially collect or dispose of solid waste within all or a defined portion of the county. Stillings v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 618, 306

                        Use of City-Owned Sewage Treatment Plant Without Prior Approval of County. - Since county had no authority to restrict or regulate city's provision of sewer service to its residents, the city could use city-owned sewage treatment plant located outside
                        the city but within the county, which was upgraded pursuant to the county's special use permit, with a condition attached to the permit requiring the county's prior approval of service to county citizens, to meet its statutory
                        mandate to provide sewer service to residents in newly annexed areas without seeking the county's prior approval, even though the facility was located in the county. Davidson County v. City of High Point,

        Regulation of Asphalt Plants.
       </b> - A county's enactment of a moratorium on the building of asphalt plants and adoption of a polluting industries development ordinance pursuant to the statute's general grant of police power, rather than through the
                        specific statutory provisions governing zoning, was proper. Tri-County Paving, Inc. v. Ashe County, 281 F.3d 430 (4th Cir. 2002).

                        Notice Required for Ordinance Regulating Issuance of Building Permits. - Where the county argued that it did not have to issue notice in compliance with G.S. 153A-323 because the ordinance, imposing a moratorium on the issuance of building permits for
                        the construction or operation of heavy industry, was enacted pursuant to the county's police power under G.S. 153A-121, the claim failed; the county adopted an ordinance that imposed a moratorium on the issuance of building permits,
                        which was governed by G.S. 153A-323, and which was, therefore, not governed by G.S. 153A-121. Sandy Mush Props., Inc. v. Rutherford County, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 683, 586 S.E.2d 849

                        Trial court erred in granting a county's summary judgment motion and in denying a property owner's summary judgment motion where: (1) an ordinance prohibiting heavy industry was enacted after the county was enjoined from enforcing a moratorium on the
                        issuance of building permits in the same area, (2) the moratorium was covered by N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 153A, art. 18 as it dealt with the issuance of building permits, (3) the county could not avoid the notice requirements G.S. 153A-323,
                        by stating that the moratorium was enacted pursuant to the police powers under G.S. 153A-121, and (4) although the county complied with the notice requirements before enacting the ordinance, the county had already been ordered
                        to issue the building permit. Sandy Mush Props., Inc. v. Rutherford County, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 162, 595 S.E.2d 233 (2004).

                        Notice Requirements for Zoning Ordinance Could Not be Avoided by Citing to Police Powers. - County's failure to comply with G.S. 153A-323 in enacting the Buncombe County, N.C. Multi-Family Dwelling Ordinance (Ordinance) rendered the ordinance invalid;
                        although the county claimed that the Ordinance was adopted in the exercise of its general police power pursuant to G.S. 153A-121, the Ordinance substantially affected land use, was therefore a zoning ordinance, and the county was
                        not permitted to evade the legislative notice requirements imposed by G.S. 153A-323 by labeling the Ordinance an exercise of police power. Thrash Ltd. P'ship v. County of Buncombe, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite>                        727, 673 S.E.2d 689 (2009).

                        Statute Did Not Authorize "School Impact Fees." - G.S. 153A-121 and G.S. 153A-340 did not authorize a county to impose "school impact fees" on new residential construction. They did not allow a county to charge a fee for providing its own governmental
                        services, such as school construction, to the public. Durham Land Owners Ass'n v. County of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 630 S.E.2d 200 (2006).

                        County Exceeded Statutory Authority With Regard to Zoning Regulations for Manufactured Homes. - County exceeded the power the general assembly conferred upon it with regard to zoning regulations for manufactured homes because an ordinance, as amended,
                        did not employ appearance and dimensional criteria as intended in G.S. 153A-341.1 and G.S. 160A-383.1 when the intent of the ordinance was to increase the tax base by the elimination of housing that rapidly depreciated in value,
                        and that wealth based criterion was neither an appearance nor dimensional criteria; G.S. 160A-383.1, as made applicable to counties by G.S. 153A-341.1, limits a county's power to enact zoning regulations for manufactured homes,
                        and a county may not use its broad police powers as a guise to enact zoning regulations for manufactured homes inconsistent with G.S. 160A-383.1. Five C'S, Inc. v.

                        Power to Enact Ordinances Giving Franchise Rights. - In general, a State legislature has the power to delegate to the state or inferior agency the authority to make ordinances, such as those giving rise to franchise rights, as it deems appropriate in
                        the lawful exercise of the police power. Stillings v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 689</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 233 (1984).

                        Effect of Annexation on Franchises. - Given the limited territorial jurisdiction of a county ordinance granting exclusive solid waste collection franchises, such franchises were not protected from the city's actions in annexing some areas of the county
                        served by the franchisees and providing free solid waste collection services in the newly annexed areas, and therefore did not survive annexation as to those areas which became part of the city. Stillings v. City of Winston-Salem,

                        Enforcement of Zoning Ordinances. - This section and G.S. 153A-345 (repealed - see now G.S. 153A-345.1 and G.S. 160A-388) give the superior court the power to enforce zoning ordinances through the issuance of an injunction. Mize v. County of Mecklenburg,

                        Ordinance's Enforcement Provisions Not Followed. - Although G.S. 153A-123 authorized Transylvania County, North Carolina, to collect a civil penalty for the violation of the terms of the Sign Control Ordinance of Transylvania County, North Carolina, a
                        civil penalty was erroneously imposed on defendants, a property owner and an advertising company, where the enforcement procedures of the ordinance were not followed. Transylvania County v. Moody,

                        Ordinance Itself Need Not Provide for Equitable Enforcement. - It is unnecessary for a zoning ordinance itself to contain any specific provision for equitable enforcement because G.S. 153A-324 allows any remedy under this section to be used at the county's
                        election as a matter of right and without qualification, unless the county's zoning ordinance provides otherwise. New Hanover County v. Pleasant, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 297 S.E.2d

                        Verification of Complaint Not Required. - In a suit wherein a county filed a declaratory judgment action pursuant to G.S. 153A-123 seeking enforcement of an ordinance and seeking equitable relief, plaintiffs were not required to verify the complaint;
                        therefore, no error occurred as a result of the trial court refusing to dismiss plaintiff's complaint for failure to have the pleading verified. Pitt County v.

                    an adequate bond be posted to protect the public from fraud. A county may charge a fee for a permit issued pursuant to such an ordinance.

                            Tax Is on Occupation, Not Goods. - Peddlers and transient dealers are commonly taxed a specific sum because they are likely to escape any other tax. A peddler's tax is on the occupation, not on the goods, and one who engages in the business, whether as
                            agent or owner, must pay it. State v. Rhyne, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 905</cite>, 26 S.E. 126 (1896).

                            Peddling Is a Privilege and Not a Right. - To peddle is not a matter of right under the laws, which any person can demand upon the payment of the tax. It is a privilege. It is discretionary with the county commissioners whether or not they will grant
                            a license to a peddler. The privilege is personal to the applicant, and is not assignable. State v. Rhyne, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 905</cite>, 26 S.E. 126 (1896).

                            An auctioneer is not deemed to be an itinerant merchant if he travels into a city or county in which he does not maintain a regular place of business and auctions merchandise belonging to another person, whether or not that person maintains a regular
                            place of business in the particular city or county. Therefore, such an auctioneer would not be required to comply with G.S. 105-53(d) or any local ordinances of the particular city or county governing itinerant merchants. However,
                            if the owner of the goods to be auctioned off does not maintain a regular place of business in the particular city or county, that person would be required to comply with G.S. 105-53(d) and any local ordinances governing itinerant
                            merchants. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. DeWitt S. McCarley, City Attorney, Greenville, North Carolina, 55 N.C.A.G. 38 (1985).

                        Constitutionality of Former G.S. 153-272. - Former G.S. 153-272, authorizing counties to regulate private collectors of garbage, was not an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, but came within the exception permitting the delegation to municipal
                        corporations and counties of power to legislate concerning local problems. Porter v. Suburban San. Serv., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 479</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 760 (1973), decided under former G.S.

                        Power to Enact Ordinances Giving Franchise Rights. - In general, a State legislature has the power to delegate to the state or inferior agency the authority to make ordinances, such as those giving rise to franchise rights, as it deems appropriate in
                        the lawful exercise of the police power. Stillings v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 689</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 233 (1984).

                        Authority of County Ordinance Concerning Collection and Disposal of Solid Waste. - County governments are delegated by the State with a general police power. Additionally, counties are specifically vested by statute with authority to regulate by ordinance
                        the collection and disposal of solid waste within their jurisdictions. In order to effect this regulatory power and meet their police power responsibilities, counties are specifically authorized by statute to enact ordinances granting
                        exclusive franchises to commercially collect or dispose of solid waste within all or a defined portion of the county. Stillings v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 618, 306

                    <p>
                        A county ordinance providing that no fees could be charged residents of the county or franchise haulers by the owners or operators of a sanitary landfill located within the county was improper, because it based fees upon the wrong criteria (residence
                        rather than kind and degree of service) in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa16s160A-314" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-314</a></cite>. Therefore, the county could not
                        enforce the ordinance against a city which operated a sanitary landfill in the county. Cabarrus County v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 192, 321 S.E.2d 476 (1984).

                        Superior court did not err in concluding that G.S. 153A-136(c) was inapplicable to a county's application for a proposed landfill site because the actions of the county's board were sufficient to constitute selection of the landfill site prior to the
                        effective date of the subsection. Accordingly, the county was not required to consider alternative sites and socioeconomic and demographic data, or to hold a public hearing prior to selecting the site. County of Wake v. N.C. Dep't

                        Motion to dismiss plaintiffs' Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964's intentional discrimination claims with regard to placement of a landfill was denied only to the extent that they were based on an alleged failure to follow
                        G.S. 153A-136(c) because the court had previously ruled that if the county's alleged violation of G.S. 153A-136(c) was no longer relevant, then it would no longer be used as proof of the county's wrongdoing by plaintiffs. Franks

                        Effect of Annexation on Franchises. - Given the limited territorial jurisdiction of a county ordinance granting exclusive solid waste collection franchises, such franchises were not protected from the city's actions in annexing some areas of the county
                        served by the franchisees and providing free solid waste collection services in the newly annexed areas, and therefore did not survive annexation as to those areas which became part of the city. Stillings v. City of Winston-Salem,

                    The county commissioners may call a referendum on approval of a property tax levy. The referendum may be held at the same time as any other referendum or election, but may not be otherwise held within the period of time beginning 30 days before and ending
                    10 days after any other referendum or election to be held in the county and already validly called or scheduled by law at the time the tax referendum is called. The referendum shall be conducted by the county board of elections. The
                    clerk to the board of commissioners shall publish a notice of the referendum at least twice. The first publication shall be not less than 14 days and the second publication not less than seven days before the last day on which voters
                    may register for the referendum. The notice shall state the date of the referendum, the purpose for which it is being held, and a statement as to the last day for registration for the referendum under the election laws then in effect.

                        Where a statute authorizing the levy of a tax beyond the constitutional limit for a special purpose is intra vires, the taxes collected beyond the requirements of the special purpose may be turned into the general fund and used for general purposes; but
                        where the act authorizes the levy partly for a "special purpose" and partly for general purposes it is ultra vires, and no part of the levy can be collected. Williams v. Commissioners of Craven County,

                        Levy to Fund Medically Unnecessary Abortions Is Ultra Vires and Void. - Section 153A-255 does not give counties the underlying authority to levy taxes pursuant to subdivision (c)(30) of this section to fund medically unnecessary abortions, since the authority
                        conferred upon counties to provide social services pursuant to G.S. 153A-255 is limited to providing the poor with the basic necessities of life, and a medically unnecessary abortion is not a basic necessity of life; therefore,
                        a county exceeds its statutorily conferred power in levying a tax to fund medically unnecessary abortions, and the tax levy is ultra vires and void. Stam v. State, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 357</cite>,

                        Tax Rate Variable. - There is no constitutional requirement that the tax rate for county purposes shall be the same everywhere. It varies in the different counties, and may vary in different townships, parts of townships, districts, towns, and cities

                        The legislature has the power to provide for the listing, assessment, and taxing of personal property omitted to be listed by the owner as the law requires. And there is no reason why it may not be taxed for five or more preceding years if it has escaped

                        may, perhaps, be an exception where a tax is levied by a special authority from the legislature, or upon the vote of the people, which would not otherwise be lawful. Long v. Commissioners of Richmond County,

                <p>
                    Before the beginning of the fiscal year immediately following the effective date of a reappraisal of real property conducted as required by G.S. 105-286, the county budget officer shall present to the board of commissioners a budget for financing the
                    cost of the next reappraisal. The budget shall estimate the cost of the reappraisal and shall propose a plan for raising the necessary funds in annual installments during the intervening years between reappraisals, with all installments
                    as nearly uniform as practicable. The board shall consider this budget, making any amendments to the budget it deems advisable, and shall adopt a resolution establishing a special reserve fund for the next reappraisal. In the budget
                    ordinance of the first fiscal year of the plan, the board of commissioners shall appropriate to the special reappraisal reserve fund the amount set out in the plan for the first year's installment. When the county budget for each succeeding
                    fiscal year is in preparation, the board shall review the reappraisal budget with the budget officer and shall amend it, if necessary, so that it will reflect the probable cost at that time of the reappraisal and will produce the necessary
                    funds at the end of the intervening period. In the budget ordinance for each succeeding fiscal year, the board shall appropriate to the special reappraisal reserve fund the amount set out in the plan as due in that year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moneys appropriated to the special reappraisal reserve fund shall not be available or expended for any purpose other than the reappraisal of real property required by G.S. 105-286, except that the funds may be deposited at interest or invested as permitted
                    by G.S. 159-30. If there is a fund balance in the reserve fund following payment for the required reappraisal, it shall be retained in the fund for use in financing the next required reappraisal.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Within 10 days after the adoption of each annual budget ordinance, the county finance officer shall report to the Department of Revenue, on forms to be supplied by the Department, the terms of the county's reappraisal budget, the current condition of
                    the special reappraisal reserve fund, and the amount appropriated to the reserve fund in the current fiscal year.

                        gross receipts derived in the preceding month from rentals upon which the tax is levied. A room occupancy tax return filed with the county finance officer is not a public record and may not be disclosed except in accordance with
                        G.S. 153A-148.1 or G.S. 160A-208.1.

                        Penalties. - A person, firm, corporation, or association who fails or refuses to file a room occupancy tax return or pay a room occupancy tax as required by law is subject to the civil and criminal penalties set by G.S. 105-236 for failure to pay or file
                        a return for State sales and use taxes. The governing board of the taxing county has the same authority to waive the penalties for a room occupancy tax that the Secretary of Revenue has to waive the penalties for State sales and
                        use taxes.

                        Repeal or Reduction. - A room occupancy tax levied by a county may be repealed or reduced by a resolution adopted by the governing body of the county. Repeal or reduction of a room occupancy tax shall become effective on the first day of a month and may
                        not become effective until the end of the fiscal year in which the resolution was adopted. Repeal or reduction of a room occupancy tax does not affect a liability for a tax that was attached before the effective date of the repeal
                        or reduction, nor does it affect a right to a refund of a tax that accrued before the effective date of the repeal or reduction.

                <p>
                    If a taxable accommodation is furnished as part of a package, the bundled transaction provisions in G.S. 105-164.4D apply in determining the sales price of the taxable accommodation. If those provisions do not address the type of package offered, the
                    person offering the package may determine an allocated price for each item in the package based on a reasonable allocation of revenue that is supported by the person's business records kept in the ordinary course of business and calculate
                    tax on the allocated price of the taxable accommodation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A retailer must separately state the room occupancy tax. Room occupancy taxes paid to a retailer are held in trust for and on account of the taxing county.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The taxing county shall design and furnish to all appropriate businesses and persons in the county the necessary forms for filing returns and instructions to ensure the full collection of the tax. A retailer who collects a room occupancy tax may deduct
                    from the amount remitted to the taxing county a discount equal to the discount the State allows the retailer for State sales and use tax.

                        by the county of the total lease or rental price, excluding highway use tax, is being charged as a tax on gross receipts. For purposes of this section, the transaction giving rise to the tax shall be deemed to have occurred at
                        the location of the entity from which the customer takes delivery of the vehicle. The tax shall be collected at the time of lease or rental and placed in a segregated account until remitted to the county.

                        and necessary for public school purposes; (2) the board determined that the replacement office space in the Government Center was more suitable for its needs; (3) this determination was adequate to meet the unnecessary or unsuitable

                        Courts cannot substitute their judgment for that of the county officials honestly and fairly exercised. For a court to enjoin a proposed expenditure, there must be allegation and proof that the county officials acted in wanton disregard of public good.

                        Effect of Limit on Expense Imposed by Legislature. - When a special act of the legislature has imposed a limit on the expense of a county to be incurred in improving its courthouse, the commissioners cannot avoid the will of the legislature as therein
                        declared by setting up a general power of contracting debts for necessary expenses, limited only by the constitutional limitation of taxation, and thus under an entire contract made beforehand expend a larger amount for the purpose
                        than that prescribed by the special act. Burgin v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 561</cite>, 66 S.E. 607 (1909).

                        have the special authority of the General Assembly. Harrell v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 225</cite>, 173 S.E. 614 (1934), holding that the county had such authority under former

                        County Bound by Conditions Expressed in Conveyance. - Where a county, owning a site upon which to build its courthouse, is authorized by statute to buy, sell, and exchange real estate surrounding it upon such terms and conditions as it may deem just and
                        proper, and for the best interest of the county, and in pursuance of this authority has acquired a conveyance of lands from adjoining owners upon condition that they shall be used as a public square and kept open for that purpose,
                        etc., regardless of whether such conditions are called conditions subsequent or otherwise they are within the purview of the authority conferred upon the county; and coming within the intent of the parties as expressed in the conveyance,

                        Commissioners Not Individually Liable for Failure to Take Contractor's Bond. - County commissioners are not individually liable for the failure of their ministerial duty to take the bond required from a contractor for the erection of a county home, such
                        not having been expressly declared; and the remedy is by indictment. Fore v. Feimster, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 551</cite>, 88 S.E. 977 (1916).

                        Discretion of Commissioners with Respect to Repair or Erection of Courthouse or Jail. - It is within the sound discretion of the county commissioners to have the courthouse or jail of the county repaired or to erect new ones on the same sites as a necessary
                        county expense, which will not be reviewed in the courts in the absence of mala fides; and should a bill of indictment be drawn by the solicitor, at the request of the judge holding the courts of the county, and a true bill be
                        found by the grand jury thereon, it is open to the commissioners to set up any available defense they may have. Jackson v. Board of County Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 379</cite>, 88 S.E. 521

                    A county may by ordinance regulate parking of motor vehicles on county-owned property. Such an ordinance may be enforced pursuant to G.S. 153A-123. In addition, the ordinance may provide that vehicles parked in violation thereof may be removed from the
                    property by the county or an agent of the county to a storage area or garage. If a vehicle is so removed, the owner, as a condition of regaining possession of the vehicle, shall be required to pay to the county all reasonable costs
                    incidental to the removal and storage of the vehicle and any fine or penalty due for the violation.

                        Commissioners Act as Fiduciaries or Trustees. - Boards of commissioners, in selling or leasing real property belonging to the county, are acting as fiduciaries or trustees for the taxpayers and citizens of the county, and must exercise their best judgment
                        and skill, as reasonable men, to obtain the best price for the land. Puett v. Gaston County, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 198 S.E.2d 440 (1973).

                        of Forsyth County, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 636</cite>, 24 S.E. 425 (1896).

                        Power to sell is not a power to mortgage; hence, express authority conferred upon county commissioners to sell real estate of the county at a fair price does not imply power to encumber the same by a mortgage. Threadgill v. Board of Comm'rs,

                        County commissioners had no authority to convey land on which they proposed to erect courthouse by a mortgage deed to secure the bonds issued to build it, and thereby render the site and buildings liable to sale for satisfaction of the debt. Vaughn v.

                        Different Methods Permissible. - G.S. 153-186 specifically anticipates that a project may require different methods for different geographical areas involved in a project and that a combination of methods may be used; therefore, an owner's challenge to
                        an assessment imposed for inlet relocation based on this reason was properly denied. Parker v. New Hanover County, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 619 S.E.2d 868 (2005).

                        What Challenge is Permissible. - Plain language of G.S. 153A-186(d) and G.S. 153A-197 suggests that, while a landowner may appeal a special assessment, he may not challenge the board of commissioners' choice of which method or methods provided for in
                        the statute should be used in calculating the assessment; nothing, however, in G.S. 153A-186(d) precludes a property owner from arguing that the special assessment was for a purpose not authorized by statute, that the board of
                        commissioners improperly abrogated its responsibilities under G.S. 153A-186(d) in choosing a method of calculation, or that the method chosen was not one permitted by the statute. Parker v. New Hanover County,

                        Duties of County Commissioners When Financing Project by Special Assessments. - Pursuant to this section, when all or any portion of a public enterprise is to be financed by assessments, the county commissioners are required to adopt a preliminary assessment
                        resolution, which must contain information about the proposed project, a statement as to the percentage of the cost of the project that will be assessed, and an order setting a date for public hearing. The preliminary assessment
                        resolution must be sent by first-class mail to each property owner in the project at least ten days prior to the public hearing. In return, the county receives a specific lien; the delinquency of the assessed obligation authorizes
                        a foreclosure of property without any exemptions allowed or the payment of prior recorded liens except local, state, and federal taxes. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,

                        Duties of County Commissioners When Financing Project by Special Assessments. - Pursuant to G.S. 153A-190, when all or any portion of a public enterprise is to be financed by assessments, the county commissioners are required to adopt a preliminary assessment
                        resolution, which must contain information about the proposed project, a statement as to the percentage of the cost of the project that will be assessed, and an order setting a date for public hearing. The preliminary assessment
                        resolution must be sent by first-class mail to each property owner in the project at least ten days prior to the public hearing. In return, the county receives a specific lien; the delinquency of the assessed obligation authorizes
                        a foreclosure of property without any exemptions allowed or the payment of prior recorded liens except local, state, and federal taxes. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,

                        County's Election of Procedural Requirements Determines Remedies and Owners' Protections. - If no special assessment liens under G.S. 153A-200 exist on the property, the process invoked and completed, rather than the words used, is of paramount importance.
                        If the requirements of this Article are met, the County then has certain remedies otherwise not available to it. However, if the County does not elect to acquire these statutory benefits by following the procedural requirements
                        which would culminate in a lien on the property, the plaintiffs do not receive the statutory protections of notice and a hearing as set out in this section. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,

                    At the public hearing, the board of commissioners shall hear all interested persons who appear with respect to any matter covered by the preliminary assessment resolution. At or after the hearing, the board may adopt a final assessment resolution directing

                    is available for inspection, and state the time and place for the hearing on the roll. In addition, at least 10 days before the date set for the hearing, the board shall cause a notice of the hearing to be mailed by first-class mail
                    to each owner of property listed on the roll. The mailed notice shall state the time and place of the hearing, note that the roll in the clerk's office is available for inspection, and state the amount as shown on the roll of the assessment
                    against the property of the owner. The person designated to mail these notices shall file with the board a certificate stating that they were mailed by first-class mail and on what date. In the absence of fraud, the certificate is

                        Scope of Appeal. - Plain language of G.S. 153A-186(d) and G.S. 153A-197 suggests that, while a landowner may appeal a special assessment, he may not challenge the board of commissioners' choice of which method or methods provided for in the statute should
                        be used in calculating the assessment; nothing, however, in G.S. 153A-186(d) precludes a property owner from arguing that the special assessment was for a purpose not authorized by statute, that the board of commissioners improperly
                        abrogated its responsibilities under G.S. 153A-186(d) in choosing a method of calculation, or that the method chosen was not one permitted by the statute. Parker v.

                    When in its judgment an irregularity, omission, error, or lack of jurisdiction has occurred in any proceeding related to a special assessment made by it, the board of commissioners may set aside the assessment and make a reassessment. In that case, the
                    board may include in the total project cost all additional interest paid, or to be paid, as a result of the delay in confirming the assessment. A reassessment proceeding shall, as far as practicable, follow the comparable procedures
                    of an original assessment proceeding. A reassessment has the same force as if it originally had been made properly.

                        Foreclosure of Assessment Liens. - Pursuant to G.S. 153A-190, when all or any portion of a public enterprise is to be financed by assessments, the county commissioners are required to adopt a preliminary assessment resolution, which must contain information
                        about the proposed project, a statement as to the percentage of the cost of the project that will be assessed, and an order setting a date for public hearing. The preliminary assessment resolution must be sent by first-class mail
                        to each property owner in the project at least ten days prior to the public hearing. In return, the county receives a specific lien; the delinquency of the assessed obligation authorizes a foreclosure of property without any exemptions
                        allowed or the payment of prior recorded liens except local, state, and federal taxes. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                        Special Assessment Proceeding. - Forced sale of land under a general lien is subjected to exemptions and prior recorded liens. It is, therefore, the special assessment proceeding itself which creates the lien for the assessment. If the county commissioners
                        elect not to pursue the procedure which would establish the lien, then the special proceeding is not necessary. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                        If the requirements of this Article are met, the County then has certain remedies otherwise not available to it. However, if the County does not elect to acquire these statutory benefits by following the procedural requirements
                        which would culminate in a lien on the property, the plaintiffs do not receive the statutory protections of notice and a hearing as set out in G.S. 153A-191. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,

                    If a special assessment has been made against property that has been or is about to be subdivided, the board of commissioners may, with the consent of the owner of the property, (i) apportion the assessment among the lots or tracts within the subdivision,

                    is released from the lien of the original assessment, and the portion of the original assessment assessed against each lot or tract has, as to that lot or tract, the same force as the original assessment. At the time the board makes
                    an apportionment under this section, the clerk shall enter on the minutes of the board the date, hour, and minute of apportionment and a statement to the effect that the apportionment is made with the consent of the owners of the property

                    and any installment not then due shall fall due at the same date as it would have under the original assessment.

                    A county may establish, acquire, erect, repair, maintain, and operate local confinement facilities and may for these purposes appropriate funds not otherwise limited as to use by law.

                    no person under the age of 18 may be held in a county confinement facility unless there is an agreement between the county confinement facility and the Division of Adult Correction and Juvenile Justice allowing the housing of persons
                    under the age of 18 at the facility or a portion of the facility that has been approved as a juvenile detention facility by the Juvenile Justice Section. A juvenile detention facility may be located in the same facility as a county
                    jail provided that the juvenile detention facility meets the requirements of this Article and G.S. 147-33.40.

                        to him and his family. The doctrine is that while such corporate agencies must provide the means and employ the men to perform such duties, they are not personally and by their own labor to perform such menial services; the default
                        to make them liable must be in neglecting to exercise their authority in the use of labor and money for that purpose, and so it must be charged to make a cause of action against them. Threadgill v. Board of Comm'rs,

                        Negligence Claim Against State Jail Inspection Agency Not Barred By Public Duty Doctrine. - Public duty doctrine did not apply to bar a negligence suit brought by multiple plaintiffs against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS),
                        after four inmates were killed and one inmate was seriously injured as a result of a jailhouse fire. Plaintiffs' complaint, which alleged that the inspector for DHHS was negligent in his inspection of the jail and that DHHS failed

                        Negligence Claim Against State Jail Inspection Agency Not Barred By Public Duty Doctrine. - Public duty doctrine did not apply to bar a negligence suit brought by multiple plaintiffs against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS),
                        after four inmates were killed and one inmate was seriously injured as a result of a jailhouse fire. Plaintiffs' complaint, which alleged that the inspector for DHHS was negligent in his inspection of the jail and that DHHS failed
                        to properly train the inspector to perform his duties as an inspector of county jails, was not barred under the public duty doctrine because DHHS' duty to inspect was for the purpose of protecting the inmates and not for protection
                        of the public generally or, even if the public duty doctrine did apply, plaintiffs fell within the special relationship exception to that doctrine of custodian/prisoner, therefore, the motion to dismiss filed by DHHS was properly

                        Prison Health Clinician Was Agent of Sheriff. - Because a sheriff had a nondelegable duty to provide medical care to inmates, defendant, who was employed by prison health services as a mental health clinician, was an agent of the sheriff as a matter of
                        law; in a prosecution for sexual activity by a custodian, the trial court did not err in barring in limine the introduction of a contract, which according to defendant showed that he was an independent contractor and not an agent
                        or employee of the sheriff's office, because as a matter of law defendant was acting as an agent of the sheriff when the crimes were allegedly committed. State v.

                <p>
                    Department personnel shall visit and inspect each local confinement facility at least semiannually. The purpose of the inspections is to investigate the conditions of confinement, the treatment of prisoners, the maintenance of entry level employment standards
                    for jailers and supervisory and administrative personnel of local confinement facilities as provided for in G.S. 153A-216(4), and to determine whether the facilities meet the minimum standards published pursuant to G.S. 153A-221. The
                    inspector shall make a written report of each inspection and submit it within 30 days after the day the inspection is completed to the governing body and other local officials responsible for the facility. The report shall specify
                    each way in which the facility does not meet the minimum standards. The governing body shall consider the report at its first regular meeting after receipt of the report and shall promptly initiate any action necessary to bring the
                    facility into conformity with the standards. Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 8-53 or any other provision of law relating to the confidentiality of communications between physician and patient, the representatives of the Department
                    of Health and Human Services who make these inspections may review any writing or other record in any recording medium which pertains to the admission, discharge, medication, treatment, medical condition, or history of persons who
                    are or have been inmates of the facility being inspected. Physicians, psychologists, psychiatrists, nurses, and anyone else involved in giving treatment at or through a facility who may be interviewed by representatives of the Department
                    may disclose to these representatives information related to an inquiry, notwithstanding the existence of the physician-patient privilege in G.S. 8-53 or any other rule of law; provided the patient, resident or client has not made
                    written objection to such disclosure. The facility, its employees, and any person interviewed during these inspections shall be immune from liability for damages resulting from the disclosure of any information to the Department. Any
                    confidential or privileged information received from review of records or interviews shall be kept confidential by the Department and not disclosed without written authorization of the inmate or legal representative, or unless disclosure
                    is ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. The Department shall institute appropriate policies and procedures to ensure that this information shall not be disclosed without authorization or court order. The Department shall not
                    disclose the name of anyone who has furnished information concerning a facility without the consent of that person. Neither the names of persons furnishing information nor any confidential or privileged information obtained from records
                    or interviews shall be considered "public records" within the meaning of G.S. 132-1. Prior to releasing any information or allowing any inspections referred to in this section the patient, resident or client must be advised in writing
                    that he has the right to object in writing to such release of information or review of his records and that by an objection in writing he may prohibit the inspection or release of his records.

                        Negligence Claim Against State Jail Inspection Agency Not Barred By Public Duty Doctrine. - Public duty doctrine did not apply to bar a negligence suit brought by multiple plaintiffs against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS),
                        after four inmates were killed and one inmate was seriously injured as a result of a jailhouse fire. Plaintiffs' complaint, which alleged that the inspector for DHHS was negligent in his inspection of the jail and that DHHS failed
                        to properly train the inspector to perform his duties as an inspector of county jails, was not barred under the public duty doctrine because DHHS' duty to inspect was for the purpose of protecting the inmates and not for protection
                        of the public generally or, even if the public duty doctrine did apply, plaintiffs fell within the special relationship exception to that doctrine of custodian/prisoner, therefore, the motion to dismiss filed by DHHS was properly

                        This section and G.S. 153A-224(b) require that a county provide emergency medical services to prisoners incarcerated in the county's jail and pay for such services. University of N.C. v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite>                        673, 386 S.E.2d 755, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 465</cite>, 396 S.E.2d 323 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Liability of County for Emergency Medical Services. - Where a sheriff in an emergency requested a physician to render services to a prisoner in his custody who had been badly wounded resisting arrest, and there was evidence tending to show that under
                        the circumstances he could not have obtained in time an order from the board of county commissioners assuming responsibility on behalf of the county to pay for such services, the objection of the commissioners that under such circumstances
                        the county would not pay for the services and that liability would only attach as to those prisoners delivered at the county jail was untenable. Spicer v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 487</cite>,
                        132 S.E. 291 (1926), decided under former law.

                    <p>
                        Payment of Expenses Under Insurance Policy. - Since medical payments made by county were mandated by statute, paying jail inmate's medical expenses was not voluntary, and therefore, payment under insurance policy was not barred for this reason. County
                        of Guilford v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 422 S.E.2d 360 (1992).

                    <p>
                        County's Claim Not Barred by Policy Exclusion. - Although insurance company argued that since county had a contract with hospital to provide medical care for prison inmates, policy exclusion barred coverage of payments made under that contract, since
                        the county's liability for inmate's medical expenses was due not to its contract with the hospital, but rather to the statutory requirement that county prisons implement a plan for providing medical care to inmates, the county's
                        claim was not barred by this policy exclusion. County of Guilford v. National Union Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 422 S.E.2d 360 (1992).

                    A county may permanently close any public road or any easement within the county and not within a city, except public roads or easements for public roads under the control and supervision of the Department of Transportation. The board of commissioners
                    shall first adopt a resolution declaring its intent to close the public road or easement and calling a public hearing on the question. The board shall cause a notice of the public hearing reasonably calculated to give full and fair
                    disclosure of the proposed closing to be published once a week for three successive weeks before the hearing, a copy of the resolution to be sent by registered or certified mail to each owner as shown on the county tax records of property
                    adjoining the public road or easement who did not join in the request to have the road or easement closed, and a notice of the closing and public hearing to be prominently posted in at least two places along the road or easement. At
                    the hearing the board shall hear all interested persons who appear with respect to whether the closing would be detrimental to the public interest or to any individual property rights. If, after the hearing, the board of commissioners
                    is satisfied that closing the public road or easement is not contrary to the public interest and (in the case of a road) that no individual owning property in the vicinity of the road or in the subdivision in which it is located would
                    thereby be deprived of reasonable means of ingress and egress to his property, the board may adopt an order closing the road or easement. A certified copy of the order (or judgment of the court) shall be filed in the office of the
                    register of deeds of the county.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any person aggrieved by the closing of a public road or an easement may appeal the board of commissioners' order to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice within 30 days after the day the order is adopted. The court shall hear the matter
                    de novo and has jurisdiction to try the issues arising and to order the road or easement closed upon proper findings of fact by the trier of fact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No cause of action founded upon the invalidity of a proceeding taken in closing a public road or an easement may be asserted except in an action or proceeding begun within 30 days after the day the order is adopted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon the closing of a public road or an easement pursuant to this section, all right, title, and interest in the right-of-way is vested in those persons owning lots or parcels of land adjacent to the road or easement, and the title of each adjoining landowner,
                    for the width of his abutting land, extends to the center line of the public road or easement. However, the right, title or interest vested in an adjoining landowner by this paragraph remains subject to any public utility use or facility
                    located on, over, or under the road or easement immediately before its closing, until the landowner or any successor thereto pays to the utility involved the reasonable cost of removing and relocating the facility.

                        Legislative Intent as to Giving Notice. - The true legislative intent is that if a municipality wishes to close a street, or a part thereof, the notices required must be given. Such an intent if fair and just, because it affords all interested parties

                        The words of the statute are clear and unequivocal. There is nothing to indicate that only those with a "special interest" must be notified by registered mail.

                    A county may by ordinance regulate or prohibit fishing from any bridge within the county and not within a city. In addition, the governing board of a city may by resolution permit a county to regulate or prohibit fishing from any bridge within the city.
                    The city may by resolution withdraw its permission to the county ordinance. If it does so, the city shall give written notice to the county of its withdrawal of permission; 30 days after the date the county receives this notice the
                    county ordinance ceases to be applicable within the city. An ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall provide for signs to be posted on each bridge affected, summarizing the regulation or prohibition pertaining to that bridge.

                <p>
                    No person may fish from the drawspan of a regularly attended bridge, and no county may permit any person to do so.

                <p>
                    The authority granted by this section is subject to the authority of the Department of Transportation to prohibit fishing from any bridge on the State highway system.

                    A county may grant to persons who between them own or occupy real property on both sides of a body of navigable water lying wholly within the county the right to construct and maintain across the body of water a bridge connecting the property. The board

                    the hearing. At the hearing the board shall hear all interested persons who appear with respect to whether the grant would be in the public interest. If, after the hearing, the board finds that the grant is not contrary to the public
                    interest, it may adopt an order granting the right to construct the bridge. The board may place reasonable terms and conditions, including time limitations, on the grant.

                        Tax Levy to Fund Medically Unnecessary Abortions Ultra Vires and Void. - This section does not give counties the underlying authority to levy taxes pursuant to G.S. 153A-149(c)(30) to fund medically unnecessary abortions, since the authority conferred
                        upon counties to provide social services pursuant to this section is limited to providing the poor with the basic necessities of life, and a medically unnecessary abortion is not a basic necessity of life; therefore, a county exceeds
                        its statutorily conferred power in levying a tax to fund medically unnecessary abortions, and the tax levy is ultra vires and void. Stam v. State, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 357</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 439

                        Liability for Illegitimate Child Fixed by Mother's Settlement. - The liability of the county for the maintenance of an illegitimate child is fixed not by its birth but by the settlement of its mother at the time of its birth. State v. Elam,
                        <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. 460</cite> (1868).

                        An illegitimate child, who has not gained a new settlement by a year's residence in some other county, is, for the purpose of being apprenticed, subject to the jurisdiction of the court of that county in which its mother was settled at the time of its
                        birth. Ferrell v. Boykin, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. 9</cite> (1866).

                        What County Liable When Mother of Illegitimate Child Is Without Settlement. - An illegitimate child, born in this State of a mother who had not resided in it for 12 months, as required by the statute then in effect, was chargeable for maintenance upon
                        the county in which it was born. Since the statute did not contemplate the case of foreign paupers, the question of settlement was left as at common law. State ex rel. Merritt v. McQuaig, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 550</cite>                        (1869).

                        of another county with such attention and board, the latter was entitled to recover the expenses thereof from the county where the pauper had his settlement. Board of Comm'rs of McDowell County v. Board of Comm'rs of Forsyth County,

                        sewer system for and on behalf of another unit of local government, such as a water and sewer district, and in conjunction therewith may exercise those rights, powers, and functions granted to water and sewer districts as found

                        Such units of local government may contract with each other to execute undertakings such as public enterprises, which would include a sewer system. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,

                        the city but within the county, which was upgraded pursuant to the county's special use permit, with a condition attached to the permit requiring the county's prior approval of service to county citizens, to meet its statutory
                        mandate to provide sewer service to residents in newly annexed areas without seeking the county's prior approval, even though the facility was located in the county. Davidson County v. City of High Point,

                        Findings. - The General Assembly finds that it is in the best interest of the residents of North Carolina to promote and fund the implementation of stormwater management programs to control and manage water quantity and flow in order to reduce the chances
                        of loss of life and damage to property due to flooding. The General Assembly also finds that a county has an integral role in furthering this public purpose by promoting and funding implementation of stormwater management programs
                        within the county's territorial jurisdiction to reduce reliance on emergency response services, to reduce negative financial impacts on the community and the public from flooding, including the cost of public infrastructure repairs,
                        to decrease the number of flood-prone homes and businesses, to increase infiltration of stormwater into the ground, and to reduce pollutants from entering the streams.

                    of the airport property. An airport shall be exempt from paying a stormwater utility fee levied on its runways and taxiways. To qualify for an exemption under this subdivision, an airport shall use the amount of savings realized from
                    this exemption for attracting business to the airport and shall provide certification to the county that the savings realized shall be used for this purpose. Except as otherwise prohibited under federal law, and upon request, an airport
                    shall provide the levying county with evidence that the full amount of savings realized from the exemption authorized under this subdivision has been used or encumbered for the purpose set forth in this subdivision. Any amount of savings
                    realized from the exemption authorized under this subdivision that is not used or encumbered for the purpose set forth in this subdivision shall be remitted to the county to be used in accordance with applicable law governing the use
                    of stormwater utility fee proceeds. Savings realized from the exemption authorized under this subdivision shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any local funding provided by the county to the airport.

                        To require notice and opportunity for hearing to all individual property owners prior to the adoption of an ordinance mandating connection of improved properties pursuant to the enabling act would be burdensome, costly to local governments, and not consistent
                        with procedures employed in the exercise of other police powers. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                        Power of County to Mandate Connections and Fix Charges. - In addition to those powers granted to the Sewer District in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.162A.html#t162Aa06s162A-88" target="_blank">G.S. 162A-88</a></cite>,
                        a county, as operator of a public enterprise, is clothed with those powers set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 153A</a></cite>, Article 15, including the power to mandate
                        connections and to fix charges for those connections under this section. The plain wording of this section clearly supports this conclusion. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                        There is no meaningful legal distinction between a mandated connection and mandated charges and fees for that connection. The latter naturally follow the former. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,

                        County Must Own "or" Operate Sewage Collection Line. - This section provides that a county may mandate connections to a sewage collection line "owned or operated" by the county. The use of the word "or," indicating the alternative, is dispositive of this
                        issue. Had the legislature intended that a county could mandate connections only when it both owned and operated a sewage collection line, the language of the statute would have so provided. McNeill v. Harnett County,
                        <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                    The board of county commissioners may impose a fee for the use of a disposal facility provided by the county. Except as provided in this subsection, the fee for use may not exceed the cost of operating the facility. The fee may exceed those costs if the
                    county enters into a contract with another local government located within the State to accept the other local government's solid waste and the county by ordinance levies a surcharge on the fee. The fee authorized by this paragraph
                    may only be used to cover the costs of operating the facility. The surcharge authorized by this paragraph may be used for any purpose for which the county may appropriate funds. A fee under this paragraph may be imposed only on those
                    who use the facility. The fee for use may vary based on the amount, characteristics, and form of recyclable materials present in solid waste brought to the facility for disposal. A county may not impose a fee for the use of a disposal
                    facility on a city located in the county or a contractor or resident of the city unless the fee is based on a schedule that applies uniformly throughout the county.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The board of county commissioners may impose a fee for the availability of a disposal facility provided by the county. A fee for availability may not exceed the cost of providing the facility and may be imposed on all improved property in the county that
                    benefits from the availability of the facility. A county may not impose an availability fee on property whose solid waste is collected by a county, a city, or a private contractor for a fee if the fee imposed by a county, a city, or
                    a private contractor for the collection of solid waste includes a charge for the availability and use of a disposal facility provided by the county. Property served by a private contractor who disposes of solid waste collected from
                    the property in a disposal facility provided by a private contractor that provides the same services as those provided by the county disposal facility is not considered to benefit from a disposal facility provided by the county and
                    is not subject to a fee imposed by the county for the availability of a disposal facility provided by the county. To the extent that the services provided by the county disposal facility differ from the services provided by the disposal
                    facility provided by a private contractor in the same county, the county may charge an availability fee to cover the costs of the additional services provided by the county disposal facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In determining the costs of providing and operating a disposal facility, a county may consider solid waste management costs incidental to a county's handling and disposal of solid waste at its disposal facility, including the costs of the methods of solid
                    waste management specified in G.S. 130A-309.04(a) of the Solid Waste Management Act of 1989. A fee for the availability or use of a disposal facility may be based on the combined costs of the different disposal facilities provided
                    by the county.

                        Property Under Consideration for Annexation into Municipality. - When a county initiates condemnation of property for a sanitary landfill, and the property is being considered for voluntary annexation into a municipality, the county may proceed with the
                        condemnation action. The county is entitled to an injunction enjoining the annexation proceeding, and the property owners and the municipality may raise the proposed annexation in the answer to the condemnation complaint, for appropriate
                        consideration by the court. Yandle v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 355 S.E.2d 216, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 798</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 91 (1987).

                    A county may adopt an ordinance providing that any fee imposed under G.S. 153A-292 may be billed with property taxes, may be payable in the same manner as property taxes, and, in the case of nonpayment, may be collected in any manner by which delinquent
                    personal or real property taxes can be collected. If an ordinance states that delinquent fees can be collected in the same manner as delinquent real property taxes, the fees are a lien on the real property described on the bill that
                    includes the fee.

                <p>

                    If a multi-county district is established, as provided in this subsection, the boards of commissioners of the counties involved shall jointly determine whether the same appraisal and assessment standards apply uniformly throughout the district, or, in
                    the case of a multijurisdictional industrial park that satisfies the criteria of G.S. 143B-437.08(h), whether there is a current need in each participating county to levy a tax, which determination shall be made by each participating
                    county's board of commissioners. This determination shall be set out in concurrent resolutions of the boards. If the same appraisal and assessment standards apply uniformly throughout the district, the boards of commissioners of all
                    the counties shall levy the same rate of tax for the district, so that a uniform rate of tax is levied for district purposes throughout the district. If the boards determine that the same standards do not apply uniformly throughout

                    that there is no current need to levy a tax for all or part of the property meeting said requirements within its jurisdictional boundaries, then that county or those counties shall be under no obligation to do so. That county or those
                    counties participating in a multijurisdictional industrial park that satisfies the criteria of G.S. 143B-437.08(h) that choose to levy a tax for all or part of the property meeting said requirements within its jurisdictional boundaries
                    may do so without setting an effectively uniform rate of tax as described above, provided such rate shall not exceed the rate allowed in G.S. 143B-317(b).

                        A county may contract to insure itself and any of its officers, agents, or employees against liability for wrongful death or negligent or intentional damage to person or property or against absolute liability for damage to person or property caused by
                        an act or omission of the county or of any of its officers, agents, or employees when acting within the scope of their authority and the course of their employment. The board of commissioners shall determine what liabilities and
                        what officers, agents, and employees shall be covered by any insurance purchased pursuant to this subsection.
                    </li>

                        If a county has waived its governmental immunity pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, any person, or if he dies, his personal representative, sustaining damages as a result of an act or omission of the county or any of its officers, agents, or
                        employees, occurring in the exercise of a governmental function, may sue the county for recovery of damages. To the extent of the coverage of insurance purchased pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, governmental immunity
                        may not be a defense to the action. Otherwise, however, the county has all defenses available to private litigants in any action brought pursuant to this section without restriction, limitation, or other effect, whether the defense
                        arises from common law or by virtue of a statute.

                <p>
                    Purchase of insurance pursuant to this subsection waives the county's governmental immunity, to the extent of insurance coverage, for any act or omission occurring in the exercise of a governmental function. Participation in a local government risk pool
                    pursuant to Article 23 of General Statute <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html" target="_blank">Chapter 58</a></cite> shall be deemed to be the purchase of insurance for the purposes of this section.
                    By entering into an insurance contract with the county, an insurer waives any defense based upon the governmental immunity of the county.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If a county uses a funded reserve instead of purchasing insurance against liability for wrongful death, negligence, or intentional damage to personal property, or absolute liability for damage to person or property caused by an act or omission of the
                    county or any of its officers, agents, or employees acting within the scope of their authority and the course of their employment, the county board of commissioners may adopt a resolution that deems the creation of a funded reserve
                    to be the same as the purchase of insurance under this section. Adoption of such a resolution waives the county's governmental immunity only to the extent specified in the board's resolution, but in no event greater than funds available
                    in the funded reserve for the payment of claims.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the purchase of insurance as authorized by subsection (a) of this section, the liability of a county for acts or omissions occurring in the exercise of governmental functions does not attach unless the plaintiff waives the right to have all issues
                    of law or fact relating to insurance in the action determined by a jury. The judge shall hear and determine these issues without resort to a jury, and the jury shall be absent during any motion, argument, testimony, or announcement
                    of findings of fact or conclusions of law relating to these issues unless the defendant requests a jury trial on them.

                        Waiver of Immunity by Local Agencies. - Since cities and counties can waive their immunity by purchasing liability insurance, local agencies of the state such as a county ABC Board can likewise waive their immunity by purchasing such insurance. McNeill

                        A governmental entity generally retains immunity from civil liability in its governmental capacity to the extent it does not purchase liability insurance or participate in a local government risk pool pursuant to statute. Kephart v. Pendergraph,

        Waiver of Immunity by Nonprofit Fire Company.
       </b> - Defendant, a nonprofit fire company employed by the county, was liable for plaintiff's injuries in a nonfire related rescue attempt only to the extent of their insurance coverage, since they had governmental immunity
                        up to their insurance coverages and were engaged in duties other than the suppression of a reported fire. Geiger v. Guilford College Community Volunteer Firemen's Ass'n, 668 F. Supp. 492 (M.D.N.C. 1987).

                        If a rural fire department was a "fire protection district fire department" subject to the requirements of G.S. 69-25.8 and G.S. 153A-435, the specific and limited immunity provided by G.S. 58-82-5 still applied to an action against the department and
                        one of its firemen for personal injuries received from one of the department's vehicles when the department and the fireman were in the process of responding to and suppressing a fire. Luhmann v. Hoenig,

                        Fire Protection District. - Relationship between a county and a fire department was consistent with a fire protection district, and, therefore, the fire department was entitled to sovereign immunity, but to extent of its insurance coverage, had waived
                        its sovereign immunity and was liable for damages to an individual injured in an accident which happened while the fire department was fighting a fire. Luhmann v. Hoenig, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 529</cite>,
                        597 S.E.2d 763 (2004).

                        County Department of Social Services. - Since County Department of Social Services was not a state agency, the Tort Claims act did not apply to claim against the Department. Meyer v. Walls, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 97</cite>,

                        Waiver of Immunity by County. - A county may waive its immunity by purchasing liability insurance to the extent of the insurance coverage. Marlowe v. Piner, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 458 S.E.2d 220 (1995).

                    <p>
                        County waived sovereign immunity to the extent that an insurance policy it purchased covered negligent acts committed by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) who worked for the county, and the trial court erred by dismissing a lawsuit which claimed that
                        a person died because EMTs employed by the county were negligent. Dawes v. Nash County, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 442</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 760 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Constituted Waiver of Immunity. - By requiring a security company to obtain an insurance policy and to name the county as an additional insured, the county contracted, within the meaning of this section, to have itself insured and, thus, waived its governmental
                        immunity. Wood v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 546 S.E.2d 641 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Actions Against Sheriffs. - The legislature has prescribed two ways for a sheriff to be sued in his official capacity, G.S. 58-76-5 and this section. Smith v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 451 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Terminated deputy sheriff clearly alleged in the amended complaint that the sheriff waived his immunity from civil liability through a plan of insurance pursuant to G.S. 153A-435; this allegation of waiver, which the court had to take as true for the
                        purpose of the motion to dismiss, was sufficient to overcome the sheriff's motion to dismiss based on sovereign immunity. Efird v. Riley, 342 F. Supp. 2d 413 (M.D.N.C. 2004).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in denying a sheriff and a surety summary judgment in a former employee's action asserting retaliatory termination because the sheriff waived governmental immunity by purchasing an official bond; the employee's claim, if supported
                        by adequate proof, came within the scope of the sheriff's official duties because she alleged that the sheriff wrongfully terminated her employment in retaliation for her decision to file a workers' compensation claim. White v.
                        Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 748 S.E.2d 334 (2013).

                        <b>
        Inclusion of the sheriff in the county's liability insurance policy
       </b> did not serve to make the county liable for the sheriff's actions or a proper or necessary defendant in plaintiff's action against the sheriff for illegal seizure of plaintiff's property. Goodwin v. Furr, 25 F. Supp.
                        2d 713 (M.D.N.C. 1998).

                        <b>
        Sheriffs Not Specified as Local Officials.
       </b> - This section provides for the availability of insurance for county officials sued for negligence in their official capacity, but does not identify the sheriff or his deputies as local officials nor specify judgments
                        against them will be paid by counties. Braswell v. Ellis, 950 F. Supp. 145 (E.D.N.C. 1995).

                    <p>
                        Local Government Risk Pool. - The county's self-funded loss program was not a "local government risk pool," for purposes of determining whether that program waived the county's governmental immunity, since the county was the sole entity retaining risks
                        and funds under the program. Kephart v. Pendergraph, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 559, 507 S.E.2d 915 (1998).

                        Proof of Waiver of Immunity. - Where plaintiff alleged and offered proof of the county's liability insurance policy, the trial court properly denied defendants' motion to dismiss based upon governmental immunity. Smith v. Phillips,
                        <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 378, 451 S.E.2d 309 (1994).

                        Self-funded Loss Program Not Insurance. - The county's self-funded loss program did not constitute insurance for purposes of waiving governmental immunity. Kephart v. Pendergraph, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 559,

                        Immunity Not Waived by Ambulance Service. - Defendant/county-operated ambulance service did not waive its immunity for claims totaling less than $250,000 since it was only insured for negligence claims equal to or above that amount. McIver v. Smith,
                        <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 518 S.E.2d 522 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Immunity Not Waived as to Employees and Premises Not Included in Policy. - A policy of insurance affording protection to a county against liability caused by negligence of named personnel and employees of the county and covering listed and described premises
                        does not waive the county's governmental immunity for negligence in the operation of a public library when the employees of the library and library premises are not included in the policy. Seibold v. City of Kinston,
                        <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 615</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 654 (1966).

                        Insurance policy purchased by Chatham County, North Carolina did not allow law enforcement employees to recover damages from the County, and because the County had not waived immunity from suit by law enforcement employees, the trial court properly ruled
                        that a school resource officer (SRO) who worked for a sheriff's department could not sue the sheriff or a chief deputy sheriff in their official capacities. However, the SRO engaged in a protected activity when he cooperated with
                        federal agents who were investigating the sheriff, and the trial court erred when it dismissed a claim for wrongful discharge which the SRO filed against the sheriff in his individual capacity. Phillips v. Gray,
                        <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 592 S.E.2d 229, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 545</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 406 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Immunity Not Waived Where Action Excluded from Coverage. - Because an insurance policy did not indemnify the defendant county against the negligent acts alleged in the plaintiff's complaint, the county had not waived its sovereign immunity. Doe v. Jenkins,
                        <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 131, 547 S.E.2d 124 (2001).

                    <p>
                        County's purchase of liability insurance was not a waiver of sovereign immunity relating to a claim alleging a failure to properly inspect during a house construction and negligent issuance of permits relating to the property because a policy provision
                        excluded construction defects such as alleged in the complaint. Norton v. SMC Bldg., <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 577 S.E.2d 310 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Because the administrators did not waive the sovereign immunity in G.S. 153A-435 through the purchase of a liability insurance policy, that excluded coverage for negligence actions, they were entitled to summary judgment. Patrick v. Wake County Dep't
                        of Human Servs., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 592, 655 S.E.2d 920 (2008).

                        Summary judgment in favor of a County was properly granted in an action by homeowners against the County for negligent inspection and negligent misrepresentation because the County did not have insurance that would have covered the claims in the case
                        and, therefore, there was no waiver of sovereign immunity under G.S. 153A-435. Bullard v. Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 729 S.E.2d 686, review denied, 735 S.E.2d 184, 2012

                        County and an officer in the officer's official capacity were entitled to summary judgment dismissing a citizen's respondeat superior excessive force claims because the county did not waive sovereign immunity as the county's liability insurance policy
                        preserved the defense. Hart v. Brienza, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 784 S.E.2d 211, review denied, 793 S.E.2d 223, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 841 (2016).

        Immunity Not Waived By University.
       </b> - University's motion to dismiss an employee's state law claims against it pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) was granted because the university, as a state agency, enjoyed the protection of Eleventh Amendment immunity
                        from liabilities that had to be paid from public funds; therefore, because North Carolina had not explicitly waived immunity from state court proceedings with regard to torts by state employees under G.S. 143-291, the university
                        did not waive its immunity through removal to federal court, nor did the university waive its immunity under G.S. 153A-435(a) by purchasing liability insurance since there was not a plain and unmistakable mandate from the General
                        Assembly to waive immunity in these circumstances. Alston v. N.C. A&T State Univ., 304 F. Supp. 2d 774 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

                        Liability Not Waived Where Action Excluded from Coverage. - Because county liability insurance policy excluded libel action from coverage, the county did not waive its governmental immunity as to this action by purchasing the policy. Dickens v. Thorne,

                        Failure to Plead Waiver of Immunity. - Lienholder that sought damages from a county, based on its claim that the county was liable for negligent acts committed by its tax collector, did not state a valid claim for recovery because it failed to allege
                        that the county had waived governmental immunity. Oakwood Acceptance Corp., LLC v. Massengill, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 199, 590 S.E.2d 412 (2004).

                        Liability for Injury on Public Walk Within Courthouse Grounds. - The liability of a county for injuries sustained by a pedestrian falling on a public walk within the courthouse grounds is no more extensive than the liability of a city to a pedestrian
                        falling upon a public sidewalk maintained by the city. Cook v. County of Burke, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 94</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 611 (1967).

        Jurisdiction of Federal Courts.
       </b> - Former G.S. 153-9(44), similar to this section, providing that the injured person could sue "in any court of competent jurisdiction in such county," did not attempt to limit jurisdiction to a State court in such county,
                        nor to a court of such county; the United States District Court was a court of competent jurisdiction in the county. Moreover, even if the legislative intent was to deprive the federal court of jurisdiction, it could not do so,
                        as federal jurisdiction cannot be defeated by a State statute prescribing the court in which an action is to be brought. Knighton v. Johnston County, 330 F. Supp. 652 (E.D.N.C. 1971).

                        Allegations of Complaint. - It is appropriate for the complaint to contain allegations regarding liability insurance and waiver of governmental immunity. Wilkie v. Henderson County, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 155,
                        160 S.E.2d 505 (1968).

                        When suing a county or its officers, agents or employees, the complainant must allege waiver of immunity by a county contracting to insure itself in order to recover. Absent an allegation to the effect that immunity has been waived, the complaint fails
                        to state a cause of action against the county. Clark v. Burke County, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 450 S.E.2d 747 (1994).

                        Trial court properly denied motions filed by a county, the county department of social services (DSS), DSS supervisory employees, and social workers to dismiss a father's claims against them in their official capacities because if they purchased liability
                        insurance as the father alleged, they could be liable for negligent or intentional actions carried out in the performance of their duties. Christmas v.

                        Motion to Dismiss. - County's motion to dismiss a personal injury action was properly denied because plaintiffs' first amended complaint specifically alleged, inter alia, that the county had purchased insurance pursuant to G.S. 153A-435 and thus had waived
                        its immunity; although an affidavit proffered by the county claimed that it had not purchased insurance, on the motion to dismiss, the trial court declined to consider the affidavit, and so did the appellate court. Based only on
                        the pleadings, plaintiffs alleged sufficient facts to survive a dismissal on the basis of governmental immunity. Robinson v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 724 S.E.2d 629 (2012).

                        Where a county is covered by a policy of liability insurance, the question of governmental immunity from suit from injuries caused by alleged negligence does not arise with reference to the validity of a judgment of nonsuit. Cook v. County of Burke,

                        As a county, a county social service agency, and agency employees in their official capacities were covered by general liability and public officials liability policies with respect to a claim of negligent supervision of a juvenile which was asserted
                        by a decedent's estate administrator, they were not entitled to governmental immunity under G.S. 153A-435(a); the administrator alleged that due to the lack of supervision of the juvenile, who had a history of violence and psychiatric
                        problems, the juvenile fatally stabbed the decedent, who lived next to the juvenile's grandmother. Fulford v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 672 S.E.2d 759, review denied,

                        Public duty doctrine did not bar a negligent home inspection claim and a liability insurance covering law officers did not waive sovereign immunity as building inspectors were not officers; summary judgment for the county was proper. Kennedy v. Haywood

                        Immunity Not Waived by County. - Strictly construing the plain language of G.S. 153A-435's immunity waiver to apply to insurance policies actually purchased by the county, the court held that a former volunteer treasurer for an emergency medical services
                        provider failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact that the county waived its immunity where the franchise agreement requiring the policy made clear that such a policy was purchased, if at all, by the provider, not by
                        the county, and the franchise agreement explicitly provided that nothing in its indemnification provision was intended to affect or abrogate the county's governmental immunity. Fuller v. Wake Cty.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 802 S.E.2d 106 (2017).

                        Trial court properly dismissed property owners' common law tort claims against a county based on immunity because the terms of an excess insurance policy did not waive the county's governmental immunity; the policy language stated that the insurer's obligation
                        to pay was not triggered until a judgment was entered against the county or the county agreed to pay the claim, with the insurer's approval, and the owners did not show that either of those triggering events had occurred. Ballard

                        In a wrongful death action arising from an incident at a county jail, although the sheriff claimed that sovereign immunity entitled him to summary judgment as a matter of law to the extent plaintiffs - the decedent's mother and the administrator of his

                        plaintiffs' claims were not barred by exclusions in the county's liability insurance under G.S. 153A-435; although the policy excluded coverage for claims arising from criminal behavior and plaintiffs claimed the sheriff was negligent
                        by violating G.S. 153A-224 - a Class 1 misdemeanor, other grounds were alleged for the sheriff's negligence. Myers v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 655 S.E.2d 882, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 360</cite>,
