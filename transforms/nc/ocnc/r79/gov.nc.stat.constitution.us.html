                    [2.] Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the congress: but no senator or representative,
                    or person holding an office of trust or profit under the United States, shall be appointed an elector.

                    [3.] The electors shall meet in their respective states, and vote by ballot for two persons, of whom one at least shall not be an inhabitant of the same state with themselves. And they shall make a list of all the persons voted for, and of the number
                    of votes for each; which list they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the senate. The president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate
                    and house of representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the president, if such number be a majority of the whole number of electors appointed;
                    and if there be more than one who have such majority, and have an equal number of votes, then the house of representatives shall immediately chuse by ballot one of them for president; and if no person have a majority, then from the
                    five highest on the list the said house shall in like manner chuse the president. But in chusing the president, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall
                    consist of a member or members from two-thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice. In every case, after the choice of the president, the person having the greatest number of votes of the
                    electors shall be the vice president. But if there should remain two or more who have equal votes, the senate shall chuse from them by ballot the vice president.

                <p>
                    [4.] The congress may determine the time of chusing the electors and the day on which they shall give their votes; which day shall be the same throughout the United States.

                <p>
                    [5.] No person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained
                    to the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a resident within the United States.

                <p>
                    [6.] In case of the removal of the president from office, or of his death, resignation, or inability to discharge the powers and duties of the said office, the same shall devolve on the vice president, and the congress may by law provide for the case
                    of removal, death, resignation, or inability, both of the president and vice president, declaring what officer shall then act as president, and such officer shall act accordingly, until the disability be removed, or a president shall
                    be elected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [7.] The president shall, at stated times, receive for his services a compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that period any other emolument
                    from the United States, or any of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    [8.] Before he enter on the execution of his office, he shall take the following oath or affirmation: - "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability preserve,
                    protect and defend the constitution of the United States."

                    they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat of the government of the United States, directed to the president of the senate; - the president of the senate shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives,
