      <p>
       Editor's Note. -
   
<span class="s1">

     Many of the cases cited below were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.078.html" target="_blank">Chapter 78</a></cite>.
     <br />

</span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - It is within the police power of the State to pass a statute for the protection of its citizens against the sale to them of worthless shares of stock in speculative companies in the exercise of a power in the State reserved from that grant to the federal government, and such a statute does not contravene either the State or federal Constitution. State ex rel. Smith v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 643</cite>, 132 S.E. 792 (1926), error dismissed, 275 U.S. 505, 48 S. Ct. 156, 72 L. Ed. 396 (1927).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter Is Within Police Power.
   
   - The regulation of the sale of securities for the protection of the public is within the police power of the State. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 621</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 844 (1939).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of Chapter.
   
   - This Chapter applies where money is invested in stock, securities, profit-sharing agreements, etc., with the purpose of securing an income from the employment of the money, and a contract whereby the owner of a copyright system gives the exclusive right to another to operate the system in certain counties, and in return is to receive a percentage of the gross receipts from the operation of the system, with further provision for a division of net profit from sales or contracts written by either party, does not contemplate the placing of money in a way to secure an income from its employment, but the earning of a portion of the gross receipts in return for individual services, and the agreement is not a profit-sharing scheme or investment contract within the intent and meaning of the statute. State v. Heath, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 135</cite>, 153 S.E. 855 (1930).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of "Blue Sky Laws"
   
   is to protect the general public from "wildcat" organizers, promoters and their agents, whether foreign or domestic, preying upon an unsuspecting and confiding public by selling "blue sky stock," without obtaining license and giving bond. State ex rel. Smith v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 643</cite>, 132 S.E. 792 (1926), error dismissed, 275 U.S. 505, 48 S. Ct. 156, 72 L. Ed. 396 (1927).

        Opinions of Attorney General
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       No Precedence over Administrative Procedure Act.
   
   - The provisions of this Chapter are not stated with the specificity and particularity sufficient to take precedence over any similar provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba01s150B-1" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-1</a></cite> et seq., which might conceivably apply to the actions and proceedings addressed by the Securities Act. See opinion of the Attorney General to Mr. Stephen M. Wallis, Deputy Securities Administrator (acting), 58 N.C.A.G. 76 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Contested Cases.
   
   - Determinations made by the securities administrator pursuant to his statutory authority are considered "contested cases" within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba01s150B-2" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-2(2)</a></cite>. Such determinations control or restrict the activities of dealers, salesmen, or issuers of securities, but these determinations only become "contested cases" if the administrator's action is "disputed" by the subject of such determination. See opinion of the Attorney General to Mr. Stephen M. Wallis, Deputy Securities Administrator (acting), 58 N.C.A.G. 76 (1988).

       Value of Property Does Not Affect Definition as a Security.
   
   - In a prosecution for violation of the Capital Issues Law the fact that the property sold is of little value is irrelevant to the question of whether the property is a security as defined by the statute. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 621</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 844 (1939).

   - Where defendant falsely told the victims that he would invest their money in stock options and subsequently falsely told the victims that he had invested their money in stock options when, in fact, defendant never actually purchased or sold a "security" as defined by subdivision (11), the State failed to present evidence linking defendant's offer to invest money for the victims to any participation of defendant in an actual transaction involving a "security" and defendant's misconduct (offering to transact business) did not fall within the scope of G.S. 78A-36.

       "Tipper" and "Tippee" Defined.
   
   - Federal law has defined a "tipper" as a person who has possession of material inside information and who makes selective disclosure of such information for trading or other personal purposes. A "tippee" is one who receives such information from a "tipper." Skinner v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 320 S.E.2d 424, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 267</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 236 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of Securities Laws to Stop Both Tippers and Tippees.
   
   - Although heretofore securities laws promulgated to protect against the disclosure of "inside information" have primarily been used to stop tippers, so as to most effectively insure that the innocent investing public is protected, the unscrupulous tippee as well as the tipper must be deterred. Skinner v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 320 S.E.2d 424, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 267</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 236 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept of selective disclosure of inside information assumes the fact that the tipper will tell a tippee who will act on the information and unfairly profit by it at the public's expense. The investing public will more readily be protected if those tippees are discouraged from acting on any inside information illegally disclosed. It is also more probable that inside trading will stop if tippers realize the senselessness of risking criminal prosecution for disclosing inside information to a tippee who will not use the information. Moreover, there should be no opportunity in the scheme of securities laws' enforcement for the tippee to weigh the reliability and the value of the tip against the amount he may be able to recover in a lawsuit against the tipper for his disclosure of false inside information, especially when that tippee could conceivably recover treble damages under the Unfair Trade Practice Act. Skinner v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 320 S.E.2d 424, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 267</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 236 (1985).

   - Investors' claims under the North Carolina Securities Act, G.S. 78A-1 to G.S. 78A-66, were not barred by the Act's statute of limitations, G.S. 78A-56(f), because the investors not only asserted claims under G.S. 78A-24 and G.S. 78A-36, but also brought a claim for securities fraud under G.S. 78A-8 and G.S. 78A-56, which were subject to the three-year limitations period, G.S. 78A-56(f); the jury's finding that the agent violated G.S. 78A-8 and G.S. 78A-56, which were subject to the three-year statute of limitations, supported its verdict.

This purpose is intended to be accomplished by the establishment of guidelines and standards of permissible and impermissible conduct in the advertising of viatical settlement contracts to assure that product descriptions are presented in a manner that prevents unfair, deceptive, or misleading advertising and is conducive to accurate presentation and description of viatical settlement contracts through the advertising media and material used by issuers of viatical settlement contracts and their sales agents.

      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1b">
       This section shall apply to any advertising of viatical settlement contracts intended for dissemination in this State, including Internet advertising viewed by persons located in this State. Where disclosure requirements are established pursuant to federal regulation, this section shall be interpreted so as to minimize or eliminate conflict with federal regulation wherever possible.
      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1c">
       Every person offering or selling viatical settlement contracts shall establish and, at all times, maintain a system of control over the content, form, and method of dissemination of all advertisements of these securities. All advertisements, regardless of by whom written, created, designed, or presented, shall be the responsibility of the issuer. A system of control shall include regular routine notification, at least once a year, to agents and others authorized by the issuer who disseminate advertisements of the requirements and procedures for approval before the use of any advertisements not furnished by the issuer.
      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1d">
       Advertisements shall be truthful and not misleading in fact or by implication. The form and content of an advertisement of a contract or purchase agreement, product, or service shall be sufficiently complete and clear so as to avoid deception. It shall not have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive. Whether an advertisement has the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive shall be determined by the Administrator from the overall impression that the advertisement may be reasonably expected to create upon a person of average education or intelligence within the segment of the public to which it is directed.

      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1e">
       Certain viatical settlement contract advertisements are deemed false and misleading on their face and are prohibited. False and misleading viatical settlement advertisements include, but are not limited to, the following representations:

The fact that the contract or purchase agreement offered is made available for inspection before consummation of the sale, or an offer is made to refund the payment if the purchaser is not satisfied or that the contract or purchase agreement includes a "free look" period that satisfies or exceeds legal requirements, does not remedy misleading statements.

       Testimonials, appraisals, or analysis used in advertisements must be genuine; represent the current opinion of the author; be applicable to the contract or purchase agreement, product, or service advertised, if any; and be accurately reproduced with sufficient completeness to avoid misleading or deceiving prospective purchasers as to the nature or scope of the testimonials, appraisals, analysis, or endorsement.

      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1k">
       When an endorsement refers to benefits received under a contract or purchase agreement, all pertinent information shall be retained for a period of five years after its use.

      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1m">
       An advertisement may state that issuer is registered in the state where the advertisement appears, provided it does not exaggerate that fact or suggest or imply that a competing issuer may not be so licensed. The advertisement may ask the audience to consult the issuer's web site or contact the department of insurance and/or the state securities regulatory agency to find out if the state requires licensing or registration and, if so, whether the issuer or its sales agents are licensed.

      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1n">
       The name of the actual issuer shall be stated in all of its advertisements. An advertisement shall not use a trade name, any group designation, name of any affiliate or controlling entity of the issuer, service mark, slogan, symbol, or other device in a manner that would have the capacity or tendency to mislead or deceive as to the true identity of the actual issuer or create the false impression that an affiliate or controlling entity would have any responsibility for the financial obligation of the issuer.

      <li id="t78Aa02s78A-14ol1o">

   the initial offering violated the registration requirements of G.S. 78A-24 and such violation precluded protection under subdivision (9) and subjected the sellers to the civil liabilities provision of G.S. 78A-56(a)(1), even though the proceeds of the initial offering were for use as seed money while the proceeds of the second offering were for use as general operating expenses, and the profit and losses between the two types of offerings were allocated differently and each
   had different tax deduction consequences. Walker v. Montclaire Hous. Partners, 736 F. Supp. 1358 (M.D.N.C. 1990).

   - Because a sales agent's testimony at trial raised a triable issue of fact concerning the number of investors in a corporation's mobile billboard advertising in North Carolina, the trial court properly submitted the issue to the jury to determine whether the agent met his burden of proof under the North Carolina Securities Act, G.S. 78A-18(b); the corporation, through its sales agents, was the actual "offeror" of the securities at issue, and the agent failed to cite any authority for his position that the registration exemption in the Act, G.S. 78A-17(9), applied to the investments because he sold them to only "11 or 12" people in North Carolina.

       The Administrator may by order deny or revoke any exemption specified in subdivision (9), (11), or (15) of G.S. 78A-16 or in 78A-17 with respect to a specific security or transaction. No such order may be entered without appropriate prior notice to all interested parties, opportunity for hearing, and written findings of fact and conclusions of law, except that the Administrator may by order summarily deny or revoke any of the specified exemptions pending final determination of any proceeding under this section. Upon the entry of a summary order, the Administrator shall promptly notify all interested parties that it has been entered and of the reasons therefor and that within 20 days of the receipt of a written request the matter will be scheduled for hearing in accordance with Chapter 150B of the General Statutes. If no hearing is requested and none is ordered by the Administrator, the order will remain in effect until it is modified or vacated by the Administrator. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the Administrator, after notice of an opportunity for hearing to all interested persons, may not modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination. No order under this subsection may operate retroactively. No person may be considered to have violated G.S. 78A-24 or 78A-49(d) by reason of any offer or sale effected after the entry of an order under this subsection if he sustains the burden of proof that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the order.

       In a civil or administrative proceeding brought under this Chapter, the burden of proving an exemption or an exception from a definition is upon the person claiming it. In a criminal proceeding brought under this Chapter, the State has no initial burden of producing evidence to show that the defendant's actions do not fall within the exemption or exception; however, once the defendant introduces evidence to show that his conduct is within the exemption or exception, the burden of persuading the trier of fact that the exemption or exception does not apply falls upon the State.

       Investments Not Exempt From Registration Requirements.
   
   - Because a sales agent's testimony at trial raised a triable issue of fact concerning the number of investors in a corporation's mobile billboard advertising in North Carolina, the trial court properly submitted the issue to the jury to determine whether the agent met his burden of proof under the North Carolina Securities Act, G.S. 78A-18(b); the corporation, through its sales agents, was the actual "offeror" of the securities at issue, and the agent failed to cite any authority for his position that the registration exemption in the Act, G.S. 78A-17(9), applied to the investments because he sold them to only "11 or 12" people in North Carolina.

       - The integration doctrine, a method used to combine two or more otherwise exempt securities sales into a single offering, was applicable to a sale of securities where initial purchaser was offered securities through a special arrangement with his broker and was classified as the sole preliminary limited partner, and where the other North Carolina purchasers were 1985 limited partners admitted pursuant to an offering about a month later.

       Sale Not Shown.
   
   - Actions of defendant, an attorney who drafted articles of incorporation and served as an original director and officer of corporation, did not constitute a "sale" and defendant was not a "seller," where there was neither evidence at trial that he was the owner of the security, nor that he was the one who successfully solicited the purchase, motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or those of the securities owner.

       Questions of Fact.
   
   - The questions of whether debentures of a finance company sold to individuals in this State in a given case are exempted securities and of whether such sales were transactions exempted from the operation and of whether the debentures sold to individuals in this State in a given case were of a class that should have been registered before being offered for sale or sold within this State are questions of fact.

       Claims Not Barred by Statute of Limitations.
   
   - Investors' claims under the North Carolina Securities Act, G.S. 78A-1 to G.S. 78A-66, were not barred by the Act's statute of limitations, G.S. 78A-56(f), because the investors not only asserted claims under G.S. 78A-24 and G.S. 78A-36, but also brought a claim for securities fraud under G.S. 78A-8 and G.S. 78A-56, which were subject to the three-year limitations period, G.S. 78A-56(f); the jury's finding that the agent violated G.S. 78A-8 and G.S. 78A-56, which were subject to the three-year statute of limitations, supported its verdict. Latta v. Rainey, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 689 S.E.2d 898 (2010).

        Initial Securities Offering Violated This Section.
       </b>
       - Where it was clear that offering of securities initially to one purchaser and to five other purchasers a month later were part of a single financing plan since the second offering was contemplated at the time of the initial offering and it was apparent that the offering memorandum would not be published until sellers were sure initial offering was purchased and the consideration for all the offerings was the same,
   the initial offering violated the registration requirements of this section and such violation precluded protection under G.S. 78A-17(9) and subjected the sellers to the civil liabilities provision of G.S. 78A-56(a)(1), even though the proceeds of the initial offering were for use as seed money while the proceeds of the second offering were for use as general operating expenses, and the profit and losses between the two types of offerings were allocated differently and each
   had different tax deduction consequences. Walker v. Montclaire Hous. Partners, 736 F. Supp. 1358 (M.D.N.C. 1990).

The registrant shall promptly notify the Administrator by telephone or telegram of the date and time when the federal registration statement became effective and the content of the price amendment, if any, and shall promptly file a post-effective amendment containing the information and documents in the price amendment. "Price amendment" means the final federal amendment which includes a statement of the offering price, underwriting and selling discounts or commissions, amount of proceeds, conversion rates, call prices, and other matters dependent upon the offering price. Upon failure to receive the required notification and post-effective amendment with respect to the price amendment, the Administrator may enter a stop order without notice or hearing, retroactively denying effectiveness to the registration statement or suspending its effectiveness until compliance with this subsection, if he promptly notifies the registrant by telephone or telegram (and promptly confirms by letter or telegram when he notifies by telephone) of the issuance of the order. If the registrant proves compliance with the requirements of this subsection as to notice and post-effective amendment, the stop order is void as of the time of its entry. The Administrator may by rule or otherwise waive either or both of the conditions specified in clauses (ii) and (iii). If the federal registration statement becomes effective before all the conditions in this subsection are satisfied and they are not waived, the registration statement automatically becomes effective as soon as all the conditions are satisfied. If the registrant advises the Administrator of the date when the federal registration statement is expected to become effective, the Administrator shall promptly advise the registrant by telephone or telegraph, at the registrant's expense, whether all the conditions are satisfied and whether he then contemplates the institution of a proceeding under G.S. 78A-29; but this advice by the Administrator does not preclude the institution of such a proceeding at any time.

      <li id="t78Aa04s78A-28ol1b">
       Every person filing a registration statement shall pay a filing fee of two thousand dollars ($2,000). When a registration statement is withdrawn before the effective date or a pre-effective stop order is entered under G.S. 78A-29, the Administrator shall retain the filing fee. A registration statement relating to redeemable securities to be offered for a period in excess of one year, other than securities covered under federal law, must be renewed annually by payment of a renewal fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) and by filing any documents or reports that the Administrator may by rule or order require.
      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa04s78A-28ol1c">
       Every registration statement shall specify (i) the amount of securities to be offered in this State; (ii) the states in which a registration statement or similar document in connection with the offering has been or is expected to be filed; and (iii) any adverse order, judgment, or decree entered in connection with the offering by the regulatory authorities in each state or by any court or the Securities and Exchange Commission.

       Any document filed under this Chapter or a predecessor law within five years preceding the filing of a registration statement may be incorporated by reference in the registration statement to the extent that the document is currently accurate.

       The Administrator may by rule or otherwise permit the omission of any item of information or document from any registration statement.
      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa04s78A-28ol1f">
       In the case of a nonissuer distribution, information may not be required under G.S. 78A-27 or 78A-28(i) unless it is known to the person filing the registration statement or to the persons on whose behalf the distribution is to be made, or can be furnished by them without unreasonable effort or expense.
      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa04s78A-28ol1g">
       The Administrator may by rule or order require as a condition of registration by qualification or coordination (i) that any security issued within the past three years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially different from the public offering price, or to any person for a consideration other than cash, be deposited in escrow; and (ii) that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this State be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the securities either in this State or elsewhere. The Administrator may by rule or order determine the conditions of any escrow or impounding required hereunder, but he may not reject a depository solely because of location in another state.

       Except during the time a stop order is in effect under G.S. 78A-29, a registration statement relating to redeemable securities to be offered for a period in excess of one year, other than securities covered under federal law, expires on December 31 of each year or some other date not more than one year from its effective date as the Administrator may by rule or order provide. Every other registration statement is effective for one year from its effective date, or any longer period during which the security is being offered or distributed in a nonexempted transaction by or for the account of the issuer or other person on whose behalf the offering is being made or by any underwriter or dealer who is still offering part of an unsold allotment or subscription taken by him as a participant in the distribution, except during the time a stop order is in effect under G.S. 78A-29. All outstanding securities of the same class as a registered security are considered to be registered for the purpose of any nonissuer transaction (i) so long as the registration statement is effective and (ii) between the thirtieth day after the entry of any stop order suspending or revoking the effectiveness of the registration statement under G.S. 78A-29 (if the registration statement did not relate in whole or in part to a nonissuer distribution) and one year from the effective date of the registration statement. A registration statement may not be withdrawn for one year from its effective date if any securities of the same class are outstanding. A registration statement may be withdrawn otherwise only in the discretion of the Administrator.
      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa04s78A-28ol1i">
       So long as a registration statement is effective, the Administrator may by rule or order require the person who filed the registration statement to file reports, not more often than quarterly, to keep reasonably current the information contained in the registration statement and to disclose progress of the offering.
      </li>
      <li id="t78Aa04s78A-28ol1j">

   - Investors' claims under the North Carolina Securities Act, G.S. 78A-1 to G.S. 78A-66, were not barred by the Act's statute of limitations, G.S. 78A-56(f), because the investors not only asserted claims under G.S. 78A-24 and G.S. 78A-36, but also brought a claim for securities fraud under G.S. 78A-8 and G.S. 78A-56, which were subject to the three-year limitations period, G.S. 78A-56(f); the jury's finding that the agent violated G.S. 78A-8 and G.S. 78A-56, which were subject to the three-year statute of limitations, supported its verdict.

       Registration with Secretary of State.
   
   - This section makes it unlawful to engage in the business of affecting transactions in securities without being registered with the Secretary of State. That registration is encompassed by the definition of "occupational license" at <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba01s150B-2" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-2</a></cite>(4a) in that registration confers the right or privilege to engage in a field of endeavor regulated by an occupational licensing agency.

       A dealer or salesman may obtain an initial or renewal registration by filing with the Administrator an application together with a consent to service of process pursuant to G.S. 78A-63(f). The application shall contain whatever information the Administrator by rule requires concerning such matters as (i) the applicant's form and place of organization; (ii) the applicant's proposed method of doing business; (iii) the qualifications and business history of the applicant; in the case of a dealer, the qualifications and business history of any partner, officer, or director, any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions, or any person directly or indirectly controlling the dealer, and a representation that the applicant dealer is duly registered as a dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; (iv) any injunction or administrative order or conviction of a misdemeanor involving a security or any aspect of the securities business and any conviction of a felony; and (v) the applicant's financial condition and history. If no denial order is in effect and no proceeding is pending under G.S. 78A-39, registration becomes effective at noon of the thirtieth day after an application is filed. The Administrator may by rule or order specify an earlier effective date and may by order defer the effective date until noon of the thirtieth day after the filing of any amendment. Registration of a dealer automatically constitutes registration of any salesman who is a partner, executive officer, or director, or a person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions. After the Administrator institutes a proceeding under G.S. 78A-39 to postpone or deny an application for registration, withdrawal of the application shall be allowed only at such time and under such conditions as the Administrator may by order determine.

       The Administrator may by rule require registered dealers to post surety bonds in amounts up to one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000) and salesmen to post surety bonds in amounts up to ten thousand dollars ($10,000), and may determine their conditions. Any appropriate deposit of cash or securities shall be accepted in lieu of any bond so required. No bond may be required of any registrant whose net capital, which may be defined by rule, exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Every bond shall provide for suit thereon by any person who has a cause of action under G.S. 78A-56 and, if the Administrator by rule or order requires, by any person who has a cause of action not arising under this Chapter. Every bond shall provide that no suit may be maintained to enforce any liability on the bond unless brought within two years after the sale or other act upon which it is based.

       The Administrator may by rule or order provide an alternative method of registration by which any dealer or salesman acting in that capacity or as a principal may satisfy the requirements of this Article by furnishing the information otherwise required to be filed pursuant to this Article. The Administrator may provide for, among other things, alternative filing periods for dealers or salesmen, elimination of the issuance of a paper license and alternative methods for the payment and collection of initial or renewal filing fees, which shall be known as "alternative filing fees". The alternative filing fees shall be the same as provided in G.S. 78A-37(b).

The Administrator may enter into an agreement with or otherwise facilitate an alternative method of registration with any national securities association registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any national securities exchange registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or any national association of state securities Administrators or similar association to effectuate the provisions of this section.

       Whenever it appears to the Administrator that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this Chapter or any rule or order hereunder, he may in his discretion bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enjoin the acts or practices and to enforce compliance with this Chapter or any rule or order hereunder. Upon a proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction, restraining order, or writ of mandamus shall be granted and a receiver or conservator may be appointed for the defendant or the defendant's assets. In addition to any other remedies provided by this Chapter, the Administrator may apply to the court hearing this matter for an order of restitution whereby the defendant in such action shall be ordered to make restitution of those sums shown by the Administrator to have been obtained by him in violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter.  Such restitution shall be payable, in the discretion of the court, to the Administrator or receiver appointed pursuant to this section for the benefit of those persons whose assets were obtained in violation of this Chapter, or directly to those persons. The court may not require the Administrator to post a bond.

       Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Administrator may obtain a review of the order in the Superior Court of Wake County by filing in court, within 30 days after a written copy of the decision is served upon the person by personal service or by registered or certified mail, a written petition praying that the order be modified or set aside in whole or in part. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith served upon the Administrator, and thereupon the Administrator shall certify and file in court a copy of the filing and evidence upon which the order was entered. When these have been filed, the court has exclusive jurisdiction to affirm, modify, enforce, or set aside the order, in whole or in part. The findings of the Administrator as to the facts, if supported by competent, material and substantial evidence, are conclusive. If either party applies to the court for leave to adduce additional material evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce the evidence in the hearings before the Administrator, the court may order the additional evidence to be taken before the Administrator and to be adduced upon the hearing in such manner and upon such conditions as the court considers proper. The Administrator may modify his findings and order by reason of the additional evidence and shall file in court the additional evidence together with any modified or new findings or order. The judgment of the court is final, subject to review by the Court of Appeals.

       A person who willfully violates G.S. 78A-12 is liable to a person who purchases or sells a security, other than a security traded on a national securities exchange or quoted on a national automated quotation system administered by a self-regulatory organization, at a price that was affected by the act or transaction for the damages sustained as a result of the act or transaction. Damages are the difference between the price at which the securities were purchased or sold and the value the securities would have had at the time of the person's purchase or sale in the absence of the act or transaction, plus interest at the legal rate as provided by G.S. 24-1 from the date of the purchase or sale, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.

Notice of rescission is effective upon deposit in the United States mail. The notice of rescission need not take a particular form and is sufficient if it expresses the intention of the purchaser to rescind the transaction.

   the initial offering violated the registration requirements of G.S. 78A-24 and such violation precluded protection under G.S. 78A-17(9) and subjected the sellers to the civil liabilities provision of subdivision (a)(1), even though the proceeds of the initial offering were for use as seed money while the proceeds of the second offering were for use as general operating expenses, and the profit and losses between the two types of offerings were allocated differently and each

       For purposes of G.S. 78A-56(a)(2)(c), an arbitration panel's imposition of control person liability on two stock purchasers' claims against the president and two directors of a brokerage firm manifestly disregarded the law and facts; there was no evidence that the president or directors were involved in the allegedly unsuitable and unauthorized transactions in the stock purchasers' accounts with the brokerage firm or in the misrepresentations of fraud by a defrauding broker, and the task of supervising the operations of the brokerage firm was not in the hands of the president or the directors.

        A cause of action for aiding and abetting a securities violation is comprised of three elements.

      <p>
       Because investment firms failed to prove that public accounting firm possessed a "high conscious intent" to assist company in soliciting investors by untrue and misleading statements, and that public accounting firm substantially assisted such a violation, the investment firms could not establish a claim for aiding and abetting a violation of G.S. 78A-56.

Mashburn v. First Investors Corp., <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 432 S.E.2d 869 (1993).

        Investor's Involvement in Constructing Offer Made to Him Did Not Bar Recovery.

        Evidence of Liability Sufficient.
       </b>
       - Evidence that broker discussed realty partnership and various securities of his security firm employer in the same conversation with one investor, that he was an employee and representative of the firm that whole time, that he operated out of firm's office in his dealings with the investors, received mail there concerning the realty partnership and in at least one case transferred money for the realty investment out of an investor's firm account, that the transfer was recorded on the firm's computer system but was never questioned by its managers, who were responsible for monitoring all transactions and who admitted that broker required more supervision than any other employee in the firm's office, was more than sufficient to sustain verdict finding firm liable as a controlling person of broker.

        No Error in Holding Firm Jointly and Severally Liable with Employee.
       </b>
       - In action against securities firm and broker employee of firm for securities fraud, evidence was sufficient to establish that firm as controlling party and breached a duty owed investers by permitting employee to engage in fraudulent conduct that was within the scope of his apparent authority as an employee of the securities firm and of the same general nature as that authorized or incidental to the conduct authorized by the firm; therefore, it was not error to hold the firm jointly and
   severally liable with employee for attorneys' fees. Hunt v. Miller, 908 F.2d 1210 (4th Cir. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proofing Prima Facie Case.
   
   - When a plaintiff successfully proves a prima facie case under G.S. 78A-56(a)(2), the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to prove that he did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the untruth or omission. Therefore, if a plaintiff proves a prima facie case, a defendant will be liable unless he brings forward evidence to prove that his statement or omission was made with reasonable care as set out in G.S. 78A-56(a)(2). Piazza v. Kirkbride, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 576, 785 S.E.2d 695 (2016), aff'd and modified in part, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 137</cite>, 827 S.E.2d 479, 2019 N.C.

       Failure to Establish Active Misstatement of Any Material Facts
   
   - Grant of summary judgment to the employing corporation and its stockholder on the former employee's G.S. 78A-56(b) claim was proper as the employee, who sold his stock in the corporation to the stockholder upon the employee's leaving the corporation because he had signed an agreement stating that only employees could own stock, did not establish that the corporation or the stockholder actively misstated any material facts regarding the sale of the stock. Sullivan v. Mebane Packaging Group, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 581 S.E.2d 452 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 511</cite>, 588 S.E.2d 473 (2003).

      <p>
       Amendment to Complaint Held Prejudicial.
   
   - When plaintiff's new counsel filed motion to amend plaintiff's complaint to include a cause of action under subsection (a)(2) almost two years after the filing of the original complaint and approximately 9 months prior to trial, the trial court denied plaintiff's motion on the basis that it would be unfairly prejudicial to the defendant.

        Failure to Give Instruction Regarding Controlling Firm's Culpable Participation Not Error.
       </b>
       - In action by investors against securities firm and its employee for securities fraud, since it is only required of a controlling person that he maintain an adequate system of internal control in a diligent manner, jury instruction which contained this language was adequate to permit the jury to find that firm had failed to adequately supervise its employee; failure to give instruction regarding culpable participation was not error.

       <b>
        Acknowledgments Held Void.
       </b>
       - To extent that acknowledgments signed by stock purchasers could be seen as releases of securities claims, they were void under subsection (1) of this section. Signature of waiver stating that purchasers received all necessary information, when they may not have, constituted anticipatory waiver of duty to disclose, and purchasers could not have known of any misrepresentation or omission at time of signing.

   remaining securities claims had to be resolved by a jury. Andrews v. Fitzgerald, 823 F. Supp. 356 (M.D.N.C. 1993).

       <b>
        Motion to Dismiss Claims as Barred by This Section Denied.
       </b>
       - Since the dates for the sale or contract for sale of securities could not be determined from the face of the complaint, plaintiffs' claims were not barred on their face by the North Carolina Securities Act's two-year statute of limitations, and defendant's motion to dismiss the North Carolina Securities Act claims as barred by that statute was denied.

        Summary Judgment Inappropriate.
       </b>
       - When investors sued a limited liability company's managers and the company's managing limited liability company (LLC) for securities fraud, summary judgment was inappropriate as to claims under G.S. 78A-56(a)(2) because the managing LLC was an offeror of securities based on a manager's solicitation of investments, and fact issues existed as to alleged misrepresentations.

        Summary Judgment Appropriate.
       </b>
       - Two managers of a limited liability company were not primarily liable for securities fraud under G.S. 78A-56(a)(2) because nothing showed the managers offered securities, as defined in G.S. 78A-2(8)(b). Atkinson v. Lackey, - N.C.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Feb. 27, 2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Business court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of sellers and a real estate company on purchasers' secondary liability claims because the purchasers failed to offer proof that either the sellers or the company provided material aid with the requisite actual knowledge under the North Carolina Securities Act; the sellers and company had no duty to disclose anything directly to the purchasers, and there was no proof they knew of the alleged misrepresentations a bidder made.
