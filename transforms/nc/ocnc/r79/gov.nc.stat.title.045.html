                <p>
                    When the mortgagee in a mortgage, or the trustee in a deed in trust, executed for the purpose of securing a debt, containing a power of sale, dies before the payment of the debt secured in such mortgage or deed in trust, all the title, rights, powers
                    and duties of such mortgagee or trustee pass to and devolve upon the executor or administrator or collector of such mortgagee or trustee, including the right to bring an action of foreclosure in any of the courts of this State as prescribed
                    for trustees or mortgagees, and in such action it is unnecessary to make the heirs at law of such deceased mortgagee or trustee parties thereto.

                    <p>
                        Power of Sale Vests in Executor of Mortgagee. - When a power of sale in a mortgage is given to the mortgagee, his executors, etc., upon default, and the mortgagee dies leaving a will under which his executors qualify, the power of sale vests in the executors
                        by virtue of this section and the contract in the mortgage. Scott v. Blades Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 44</cite>, 56 S.E. 548 (1907).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even Absent Stipulation to That Effect. - The executor of a mortgagee may exercise the power of sale contained in the mortgage when the deed in terms confers such power upon the mortgagee and his executors. This section was intended to confer the power
                        of sale upon executors and administrators when such power is not given in the deed. Yount v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 520</cite>, 13 S.E. 892 (1891).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Joint Exercise of Power of Sale by Executors of Mortgagee. - While the executors of a deceased mortgagee may exercise the power of sale in the mortgage, where there are two executors of the deceased mortgagee the power must be exercised by them jointly.
                        Combs v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 585</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 100 (1950).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Objection to Foreclosure to Be Raised. - If the foreclosure proceeding was not authorized for any reason or if it was irregularly conducted (e.g., the notice was incorrect or inadequate in certain respects; the affidavit of default was based on hearsay),
                        it was incumbent on the mortgagor to raise that issue in that proceeding either by objection or motion in the cause. Douglas v. Pennamco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 331 S.E.2d 298,
                        cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 664</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 399 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Collateral Attack Not Permitted. - The law does not permit a collateral attack on a foreclosure proceeding and judgment. Douglas v. Pennamco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 331 S.E.2d 298, cert. denied,
                        <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 664</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 399 (1985).

                    The executor or administrator of any deceased mortgagee or trustee in any mortgage or deed of trust heretofore or hereafter executed may renounce in writing, before the clerk of the superior court before whom he qualifies, the trust under the mortgage

                    a trustee can be appointed. In every such case of renunciation the clerk of the superior court of any county wherein the said mortgage or deed of trust is registered has power and authority, upon proper proceedings instituted before
                    him, as in other cases of special proceedings, to appoint some person to act as trustee and execute said mortgage or deed of trust. The clerk, in addition to recording his proceedings in his book of orders and decrees, shall record
                    a separate instrument, as required by G.S. 161-14.1, containing the name of the substituted trustee or mortgagee, with the register of deeds of said county.

                        In addition to the rights and remedies now provided by law, the noteholders may, in their discretion, substitute a trustee whether the trustee then named in the instrument is the original or a substituted trustee or a holder or owner of any or all of
                        the obligations secured thereby, by the execution of a written document properly recorded pursuant to Chapter 47 of the North Carolina General Statutes. An attorney who serves as the trustee or substitute trustee shall not represent
                        either the noteholders or the interests of the borrower while initiating a foreclosure proceeding. Notwithstanding this restriction, an attorney may serve as the trustee in a foreclosure proceeding while simultaneously representing
                        the noteholders on unrelated matters and others within the attorney's firm may also continue to represent the noteholders on unrelated matters. Additionally, an attorney who has as trustee initiated a foreclosure proceeding may
                        resign as trustee after the foreclosure is contested and act as counsel to the noteholders.

                        Section Becomes Part of Contract. - Where a deed of trust is executed after the effective date of this section, the provisions of this section enter into and become a part of the contract, and a later statute providing a more economical and expeditious
                        procedure for such substitution, so long as the rights of the parties, especially those of the cestui que trust, are not injuriously affected, does not violate the constitutional provisions. Bateman v. Sterrett,

                        Trustee's Right to Foreclose. - Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court's foreclosure order because, while the trial court erroneously entered a "dismissal with prejudice," it properly refused to authorize the bank to proceed with the non-judicial
                        foreclosure by power of sale where the bank failed to establish a substitute trustee's authority to foreclose the deed of trust due to the significant internal inconsistencies in the power of attorney at issue, and the bank did
                        not effectuate any of ways to overcome the inconsistencies. In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Lucks, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 222</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 501 (2016).

                        A substituted trustee succeeds to all the rights, titles and duties of the original trustee, and has the power to foreclose the instrument according to its terms upon default. Pearce v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 636</cite>,

                <p>
                    Whenever before January 1, 1979, a trustee has been substituted in a deed of trust in the manner provided by G.S. 45-10 to 45-17, but the instrument executed by the holder and/or owners of all or a majority in amount of the indebtedness, notes, bonds,
                    or other instruments secured by said deed of trust, has not been registered as provided by said sections until after the substitute trustee has exercised some or all of the powers conferred by said deed of trust upon the trustee therein,
                    including the advertising of the property conveyed by said deed of trust for sale, the sale thereof, and the execution of a deed by such substituted trustee to the purchaser at such sale, all such acts of said substituted trustee shall
                    be deemed valid and effective in the same manner and to the same extent as if said instrument substituting said trustee, had been registered prior to the performance by said substituted trustee of any one or more of said acts, or other
                    acts authorized by such deed of trust.

                        Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - Plaintiff sought a strict foreclosure, which was no longer recognized in North Carolina, and by not pursuing a foreclosure sale, plaintiff was not seeking a foreclosure procedure allowed under either of the foreclosure statutes;
                        plaintiff failed to invoke the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction, and thus the default judgment order, to the extent it ordered the conveyance of defendant's real property, and the subsequent order of divestiture, were
                        void for lack of jurisdiction. Banks v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 528, 796 S.E.2d 361 (2017).

                        This Article and G.S. 1-339.1 through 1-339.40 Provide Exclusive Means of Foreclosure. - Foreclosure may be by judicial sale pursuant to G.S. 1-339.1 through 1-339.40, or, if expressly provided in the deed or mortgage, by power of sale under this Article.
                        These statutes provide the exclusive means for foreclosure in North Carolina, and it was error for the trial court to provide for foreclosure in any other manner. Wolfe v.

                        Foreclosure pursuant to a power of sale is strictly regulated by this Article, which requires a hearing before the clerk of superior court to determine four issues. If the clerk determines the existence of each item, the clerk then authorizes the trustee
                        to proceed with the sale pursuant to the power of sale contained in the mortgage instrument itself. This procedure enables the trustee or mortgagee to conduct the foreclosure sale with a level of judicial involvement somewhat less
                        than that required in a foreclosure by action. If the mortgage contains a power of sale, the mortgagee or trustee may elect to proceed under this Article or may choose to proceed under foreclosure by action. Phil Mechanic Constr.

                        This Article does not apply to or prevent bringing of foreclosure by action. However, when a mortgagee or trustee elects to proceed under G.S. 45-21.1 et seq., issues decided thereunder as to the validity of the debt and the trustee's right to foreclose
                        are res judicata and cannot be relitigated in an action for strict judicial foreclosure. Phil Mechanic Constr. Co. v. Haywood, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 325 S.E.2d 1 (1985).

                        by the bankruptcy judge, the foreclosing trustee was required to pursue foreclosure again by readvertising and selling the property in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 45-21.16A, 45-21.17, and 45-21.17A. Beneficial Mortg.

                        with the power of sale foreclosures within 10 days of a public auction pursuant to G.S. 45-21.27, the government had to rely on the language in 26 U.S.C.S.

                        he will require the cash deposit when the terms of the deed of trust do not require a cash deposit. White v. Lemon Tree Inn, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 239 S.E.2d 878 (1978).

                    When a series of notes maturing at different times is secured by a mortgage or deed of trust and the exercise of the power of sale for the satisfaction of one or more of the notes is barred by the statute of limitations, that fact does not bar the exercise
                    of the power of sale for the satisfaction of indebtedness represented by other notes of the series not so barred.

                        Former G.S. 45-26 was not a mere statute of limitation, and was not required to be pleaded by a party whose rights might be affected. It simply destroyed, by direct prohibition, the authority of any power of sale made in the mortgage contract or conveyance.

                        Construction Against Exercise of Power. - Where reasonable doubt existed as to the interpretation of former G.S. 45-26, it was required to be strictly construed against the exercise of the power of foreclosure and doubt would be resolved in favor of the
                        holder of the equitable title. Spain v. Hines, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 432</cite>, 200 S.E. 25 (1938).

                        Exercise of Power in Mortgage Subject to 10-Year Limitation. - While formerly there was no bar to the execution of a power of sale contained in a mortgage of lands, by former G.S. 45-26 mortgages then executed were made subject to the 10-year statute.
                        Jenkins v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 184</cite>, 95 S.E. 166 (1918).

                        was barred, was changed by former G.S. 45-26. Lester Piano Co. v. Loven, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 96</cite>, 176 S.E. 290 (1934).

                        The provisions of G.S. 1-47(3), relating to the bar of actions to foreclose mortgages of real property, were required to be read into former G.S. 45-26; and it appears that a power of sale contained in a mortgage becomes inoperative and unenforceable
                        when not exercised within 10 years after the forfeiture of the mortgage, or after the power of sale becomes absolute, or within 10 years after the last payment on the same "where the mortgagor or grantor has been in possession
                        of the property." Ownbey v. Parkway Properties, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 54</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 900 (1942).

                        Ten-Year Period Runs from Maturity of Note or Notes Secured. - The right to exercise any power of sale contained in a deed of trust is barred after 10 years from the maturity of any note or notes secured thereby, where no payments have been made thereon
                        extending the statute. Lowe v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 634</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 1 (1965).

                        Statute Does Not Commence Running until Debt Is Due. - The statute of limitations does not begin to run against the principal of a mortgage of lands until it is due, and the power of sale contained in the mortgage may be exercised within 10 years after
                        the maturity of the principal. Scott v. Blades Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 44</cite>, 56 S.E. 548 (1907).

                        Restraint of Foreclosure. - Where notes secured by a mortgage were barred by the statute of limitations, and the power of sale contained in the instrument was barred by the lapse of over 10 years from the date of the last payment on the notes, the trustee's
                        contention that the mortgagor would have to pay the amount of the notes in order to be entitled to the equitable relief of restraining the foreclosure, on the principle that he who seeks equity must do equity, was unavailing. Serls

                        Court of Appeals erred in affirming an order dismissing a bank's judicial foreclosure action for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because it applied the requirements applicable to non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale, and
                        not the notice-pleading standard applicable to judicial foreclosures, the bank adequately pled its claim for judicial foreclosure and provided adequate notice of the claim, the bank's attachment of additional exhibits in support
                        of its claim did not deprive borrower of adequate notice of foreclosure by judicial action, and the absence of an endorsement did not deprive the bank of the right to enforce the instrument. United States Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Pinkney,

                        The intent of the General Assembly in enacting the notice and hearing provisions of this section was not to alter the essentially contractual nature of the remedy of foreclosure under a power of sale, but rather to satisfy the minimum due process requirements
                        of notice to interested parties and hearing prior to foreclosure and sale. In re Burgess, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 267 S.E.2d 915 (1980).

                        Minimum Due Process Requirements. - The previous foreclosure statute was declared unconstitutional because it did not provide adequate notice of foreclosure and did not provide a foreclosure hearing, but this section was enacted to satisfy these minimum
                        due process requirements. Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Raleigh Oaks Joint Venture, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 451 S.E.2d 325 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Scope of Section. - Inasmuch as this section was the first legislation enacted which affected foreclosure proceedings after the decision in Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975), which held the then existing procedures before the clerk
                        unconstitutional, it is safe to assume that the legislature was responding to the due process requirements set out in that case. This section, therefore, would be concerned solely with procedures taking place before the clerk of
                        court and appeals therefrom to the district or superior court, not with the more traditional and constitutionally permissible procedures for appeal from the district court or the superior court to the Court of Appeals. In re Simon,

                        contained in G.S. 45-21.16(d) and lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider and confirm the arbitration award. In re Foreclosure of the Nine Deeds of Trust of Marshall &amp; Madeline Cornblum,

                        elements under G.S. 45-21.16(d) since the debtors did not dispute that they were correct copies, the photocopies indicated that the original holder of both instruments was not the party seeking to foreclose; the photocopies did
                        not indicate that the original holder negotiated, indorsed, or transferred the note to the party seeking to foreclose. In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Hannia M. Adams &amp; H. Clayton Adams,

                        Issues to Be Determined by Clerk and on Hearing De Novo. - Under this section, there are only four issues before the clerk at a foreclosure hearing: the existence of a valid debt of which the party seeking to foreclose is the holder, the existence of
                        default, the trustee's right to foreclose, and the sufficiency of notice to the record owners of the hearing. The clerk's findings are appealable to the superior court within 10 days for a hearing de novo, but the court's authority

                        Upon appeal from an order of the clerk authorizing the trustee to proceed with sale, the judge is limited upon the hearing de novo to determining the same four issues resolved by the clerk. Those issues are: (1) the existence of a valid debt of which
                        the party seeking to foreclose is the holder; (2) default; (3) the right to foreclose under the instrument; and (4) notice to those entitled to such.

                        Trial court did not exceed its authority by examining the underlying validity of the loan documents in a foreclosure proceeding, because such an inquiry related to the finding of a "valid debt" under G.S. 45-21.16; the trial court properly found that
                        the debt claimed by the lender pursuant to the note was not valid. In re Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 642 S.E.2d 485 (2007).

                        Allowance of a power of sale foreclosure of the borrowers' home to proceed was appropriate because the borrowers ceased making payments on a valid debt, the trial court found that a bank was then in possession of the original promissory note and that
                        the note contained a chain of valid and complete indorsements from the original lender to the bank, and the authorized appointment of a substitute trustee after the decision by the clerk of court to allow foreclosure to proceed
                        was appropriate. In re Forclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Worsham, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 239 (2019), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 268</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 350, 2020 N.C. LEXIS

                        Findings of Fact. - Superior court's order allowing a foreclosure to proceed was reversed where G.S. 45-21.16(d1) required it to conduct a de novo hearing and not just a de novo review, as a result G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 52(a), required it to make
                        its own findings of fact as to each of the statutorily-required factors set forth in G.S. 45-21.16(d), and the superior court had not done so. In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Garvey,

                        Limitation on Findings of Fact. - The clerk of superior court is limited to making the four findings of fact specified in this section, and it follows that the superior court judge is similarly limited in the hearing de novo. In re Watts,

                        A superior court judge is not authorized to invoke equity jurisdiction in a hearing de novo on appeal pursuant to subsection (d) of this section. He is limited to hearing the same matters in controversy which were before the clerk of superior court. In

                        Equitable Defenses May Be Asserted in Action Under G.S. 45-21.34. - Because the hearing under this section is designed to provide a less timely and expensive procedure than foreclosure by action, it does not resolve all matters in controversy between
                        mortgagor and mortgagee. If respondents feel that they have equitable defenses to the foreclosure, they should be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under G.S. 45-21.34. In re Helms,

                        How Equitable Defenses Raised. - Equitable defenses, such as the acceptance of late payments, may not be raised in a foreclosure hearing pursuant to this section, but must instead be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under G.S. 45-21.34.
                        In re Fortescue, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 330 S.E.2d 219, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 330</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 890 (1985).

                    <p>
                        The trial court erred in considering an equitable defense to foreclosure in a hearing held pursuant to this section, because the debtor had to pursue such a defense through an action to enjoin the foreclosure pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34. In re Trust of
                        Azalea Garden Bd. &amp; Care, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 535 S.E.2d 388 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Borrowers could not raise the equitable defense of merger based on their filing of a quitclaim deed to prevent foreclosure in an action for foreclosure under power of sale pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16 when the existence of all the conditions required under
                        the statute was undisputed. Mosler v. Druid Hills Land Co., <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 293, 681 S.E.2d 456 (2009).

                    <p>
                        Trial court exceeded its authority in considering the equitable estoppel defense asserted by the mortgagors' in a power of sale foreclosure action. In re Young, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 744 S.E.2d 476 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Defense that the mortgagor was incompetent to execute the deed of trust was not available in a pre-foreclosure hearing either before the clerk or before the superior court on appeal; however, such defense could be raised by bringing an action to enjoin
                        the foreclosure under G.S. 45-21.34. In re Godwin, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 703, 468 S.E.2d 811 (1996).

                        Trial Court Properly Refused To Consider Rescission Defense. - Trial court did not err in refusing to consider mortgagors' defense that the debt a substitute trustee sought to foreclose was not a valid debt because the trial court properly concluded that
                        the mortgagors' argument that they had rescinded the loan transaction, invaliding the debt the trustee sought to foreclose, was an equitable defense and not properly before the trial court. In re Foreclosure by David A. Simpson,

                        Bankruptcy court had the power to hear <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> debtors' claim that a deed they signed should be reformed because it encumbered a larger tract
                        of land than the debtors agreed to encumber when they borrowed money from a home loan company. A clerk that reviewed a bank's foreclosure request under G.S. 45-21.16 did not make findings of fact concerning the accuracy of the
                        property's description, so the debtors' claim for reformation was not barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, the debtors' request was timely under G.S. 45-21.27, and G.S. 45-21.34 allowed courts to enjoin a sale upon the ground
                        that the amount bid or price offered was inadequate and inequitable and would result in irreparable damage to the owner. Hinson v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (In re Hinson), 481 B.R. 364 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2012).

                        Valid Debt Must Be Shown. - A party seeking to go forward with foreclosure under a power of sale must establish by competent evidence the existence of a valid debt of which he is the holder.

                        Evidence of Valid Debt. - The introduction of a promissory note, along with evidence of execution and delivery, in the absence of probative evidence to the contrary, will support the finding of a valid debt in a proceeding to foreclose under a power of
                        sale. In re Cooke, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 246 S.E.2d 801 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Subdivision (d)(i) of this section permits the clerk to find a valid debt of which the party seeking to foreclose is a holder if there is competent evidence that the party seeking to foreclose is the holder of some valid debt, irrespective of the exact
                        amount owed. In re Burgess, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 267 S.E.2d 915 (1980).

                        Evidence of a repurchase agreement, whereby seller agrees with the lender that seller will repurchase goods sold to debtor in the event of default by debtor on the loan used to finance the sale, is proper evidence of the existence of a valid debt and
                        the right to foreclose. Hofler v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 293 S.E.2d 238 (1982), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 325</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 670 (1984).

                        In an action by a lender to foreclose a deed of trust securing a note, where the borrower failed to refute the presumption of consideration for a note under seal, there was no competent evidence to support a conclusion that a valid debt did not exist.

                        Trial court did not err by ordering a foreclosure sale under G.S. 45-21.16 based on a finding that respondent was the holder of the note sought to be foreclosed and the note evidenced a valid debt petitioners owed. They failed to prove that two individuals
                        who advised them as to their rights and obligations under the mortgage at closing engaged in the unauthorized practice of law so as to render the debt invalid. In re Gray, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite>                        46, 741 S.E.2d 888 (2013).

                    <p>
                        Pertinent parts of an estate order were void and had no legal effect on a foreclosure action because the clerk of court had no jurisdiction over the property which was not part of an estate and a court erred in ordering that a deed of trust, which secured
                        property outside the estate, was cancelled. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust from Manning, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 747 S.E.2d 286 (2013).

                        Bank presented sufficient evidence to establish all the required elements of G.S. 45-21.16, because the bank showed that it was the holder of a promissory note through a corporate merger, and a default on the debt. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust

                        In a foreclosure by power of sale, the trial court shall enter an order permitting foreclosure upon finding: (i) a valid debt of which the party seeking to foreclose is the holder, (ii) default, (iii) right to foreclose under the instrument, and (iv)
                        notice to those entitled. A corporation's plan of reorganization (confirmed plan) evidenced a valid debt, and the deed of trust and confirmed plan adequately described the indebtedness each secured, which was sufficient to notify
                        creditors of the nature of the obligations. In re Foreclosure of a N.C. Deed of Trust, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 764 S.E.2d 221 (2014).

                        Valid Debt Not Shown. - Where defendants executed a promissory note and deed of trust with the understanding that photo processing equipment would be assigned to them, but authorization for the assignment was never obtained, and the defendants did not
                        have possession of the equipment there was a failure of consideration and no valid debt was created between the parties. In re Land Covered By Certain Deed of Trust, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite>                        133, 472 S.E.2d 369 (1996).

                        Where all parties to an appeal agreed that the defendants' signatures on a loan application were forged and the president of the bank, a long-time friend of one defendant's father, accepted his representation of the signatures as authentic, the superior
                        court correctly found that there was no "valid debt" for plaintiff/bank to enforce, that the loans were not ratified because the loan maker did not act as defendants' agent, and defendants did not receive, directly or indirectly,
                        any of the loan proceeds; foreclosure under power of sale was properly denied. Espinosa v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 520 S.E.2d 108 (1999).

                        No Valid Debt and No Default. - Where person executed notes and deed of trust based upon the understanding and for the specific consideration that no criminal proceedings would be instituted against her and criminal proceedings subsequently were instituted,
                        the notes and deed of trust were without consideration, and the lower court was correct in finding (1) no valid debt existed and (2) there was no default on the notes or deed of trust, thereby properly disallowing the foreclosure
                        proceeding. In re Kitchens, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 175, 437 S.E.2d 511 (1993).

                        Possession is significant in determining whether a person is the holder of a valid debt, and the absence of possession defeats that status. Connolly v. Potts, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 306 S.E.2d 123 (1983).

                        Failure to Contradict Evidence of Possession and Past Due Note. - If the respondent in a proceeding to foreclose under a power of sale fails to offer any evidence to contradict evidence of possession and of a past due note when it is introduced in a foreclosure
                        proceeding, the trial court's finding of default will not be disturbed on appeal. In re Cooke, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 575, 246 S.E.2d 801 (1978).

                        note, that was not sufficient evidence that the trustee was the "holder" of the note under the UCC, G.S. 25-1-201(b)(21); the note was not indorsed to the trustee or to bearer, a prerequisite to confer upon the trustee the status
                        of holder under G.S. 25-1-201(b)(21). In re Foreclosure by David A. Simpson, P.C., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 711 S.E.2d 165 (2011).

                        Failure To Determine Holder Of Adjustable Rate Note. - Trial court erred in permitting a substitute trustee to proceed with foreclosure proceedings under G.S. 45-21.16(d) because there was no competent evidence that the trustee was the owner and holder
                        of a mortgagor's adjustable rate note and deed of trust, and production of an original note at trial did not, in itself, establish that the note was transferred to the party presenting the note with the purpose of giving that party
                        the right to enforce the instrument; the trial court's findings of fact did not address who had possession of the mortgagor's note at the time of the de novo hearing, and without a determination of who had physical possession of
                        the note, the trial court could determine, under the Uniform Commercial Code, G.S. 25-1-201(b)(21), the entity that was the holder of the note. In re Foreclosure by David A. Simpson, P.C., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite>                        483, 711 S.E.2d 165 (2011).

                        Insufficient Evidence Of Holder Of Adjustable Rate Note. - Substitute trustee did not offer sufficient evidence that a bank, as trustee, was the holder of a mortgagor's adjustable rate note and, thus, the party entitled to proceed with a foreclosure action
                        under G.S. 45-21.16(d) because pursuant to the Uniform Commercial Code, G.S. 25-3-110(c), the note was payable to the bank as trustee; the note was clearly indorsed to the bank as trustee. In re Foreclosure by David A. Simpson,

                        Surviving Corporation Was Holder of Note. - Lender's successor's evidence, including a letter from the Comptroller of the Currency officially certifying a merger between the successor and the lender, was sufficient to establish the merger. The successor,
                        as the surviving corporation after the merger, succeeded by operation of law to the lender's status as holder of a note, pursuant to G.S. 55-11-06(a)(2). In re Foreclosure of N.C. Deed of Trust by Carver Pond I L.P.,

                        Affiant's conclusion that petitioner was the holder of a note and a deed of trust petitioner sought to foreclose was a legal conclusion and was disregarded; whether an entity was a holder under G.S. 25-1-201(b)(21) was a legal conclusion that was to be
                        determined by a court on the basis of factual allegations. In re Yopp, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 720 S.E.2d 769 (2011).

                        Determining which property is legally secured by a deed of trust is a proper issue and element of proof before the Clerk of Superior Court. Therefore, if a party contends that the property is not secured, or should no longer be secured by the deed of
                        trust, such contention may be raised as a defense to the four requisite findings under this section. In re Michael Weinman Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 221</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 385 (1993).

                        Duty of Court to Consider All Relevant Documents. - The trial court's denial of the creditor's right to foreclose was in error where the court determined the rights of the parties under the deed of trust only, and failed to apply the provisions of the
                        original promissory note, modified by the compromise and settlement agreement and the amended plan of reorganization. In re Trust of Azalea Garden Bd. &amp; Care, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite>                        45, 535 S.E.2d 388 (2000).

                        Trustee's Right to Foreclose. - Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court's foreclosure order because, while the trial court erroneously entered a "dismissal with prejudice," it properly refused to authorize the bank to proceed with the non-judicial
                        foreclosure by power of sale where the bank failed to establish a substitute trustee's authority to foreclose the deed of trust due to the significant internal inconsistencies in the power of attorney at issue, and the bank did
                        not effectuate any of ways to overcome the inconsistencies. In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Lucks, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 222</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 501 (2016).

                        Substitute Trustee. - The substitute trustee at the time of a hearing being a different trustee than the trustee identified in the notice of hearing did not require that the hearing be re-noticed, or prevent the trial court from correctly concluding that
                        the substitute trustee at the time of the hearing was authorized to foreclose. In re Forclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Worsham, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 239 (2019), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 268</cite>,

                        Evidence of Right to Foreclose. - Subdivision (d)(iii) of this section permits the clerk to find a right to foreclose under the instrument if there is competent evidence that the terms of the deed of trust permit the exercise of the power of sale under
                        the circumstances of the particular case. In re Burgess, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 267 S.E.2d 915 (1980).

                        Because evidentiary rules were relaxed in nonjudicial power-of-sale foreclosure proceedings, the binder of relevant documents supplied by the lender, which included the promissory note and deed of trust, along with the parties' stipulations, provided
                        sufficient competent evidence of the existence of the statutorily required criteria to support a superior court's foreclosure order. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop. Under Deed of Trust from Clayton,

                        Foreclosure under Original Deed of Trust Where Second Deed of Trust Invalid. - Where second deed of trust was given by respondents as security for second loan, which was used to pay off first loan, the parties intending the second note and deed of trust
                        to replace and be substituted for the original note and deed of trust, but failure of the respondents to affix the proper signatures to the second deed of trust caused it to be invalid and amounted to substantial failure of consideration
                        for the second loan agreement, the second loan agreement was rendered a nullity, and the parties' duties under the original loan agreement were revived. Thus, where respondents were in default under the original debt petitioner
                        had a right to foreclose under the original deed of trust. Bowers v. Bowers, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 708, 329 S.E.2d 725, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 540</cite>, 335 S.E.2d

        The statutory scheme set forth in this section and G.S. 45-21.17 applies directly to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) when it exercises its subrogation rights
       </b> under state law to recover amounts paid to cover deficiencies after defaults on VA guaranteed loans. Under a subrogation theory, the VA's rights are the same as those of the lender who foreclosed, and thus are governed
                        by state foreclosure law such as the North Carolina antideficiency statute. The VA therefore lost its right to subrogation against plaintiff-borrower when bank-lender failed to comply with the statutory notice requirements. Boley

                        Nature of Foreclosure by Power of Sale. - Order granting bank's motion to lift the stay of foreclosure proceedings against an owner was proper because the foreclosure action was not a compulsory counterclaim in a separate federal action. G.S. 1A-1, N.C.
                        R. Civ. P. 13(a) did not compel the bank to pursue its foreclosure in the federal action; pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 2072, Fed. R. Civ. P. 13(a) did not apply to the bank's foreclosure by power of sale and thus, did not require the bank to file the foreclosure action as a compulsory counterclaim in the federal action. The notice and
                        hearing provisions in G.S. 45-21.16 do not alter the contractual nature of a foreclosure by power of sale in North Carolina. In re Foreclosure of a Deed of Trust from Draffen, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. App.</cite> 39, 731

                        Arbitration Issue. - Trial court properly refused to rule on the owners' motion to compel arbitration in a foreclosure action because, as the substitute trustee initiated the foreclosure under a power of sale, both the clerk's and the trial court's scope
                        of review was limited to issues related to the six findings specified in G.S. 45-21.16; the owners' argument concerning their right to arbitration was not pertinent to the six required findings. The owners should have raised their
                        right to arbitrate in a motion to enjoin pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, which granted the trial court statutory authority and jurisdiction to issue a stay and enforce the arbitration agreement contained in the deed of trust. In re

                        Denial of a co-owner's motion for a jury trial in his appeal from a clerk's order allowing a foreclosure was proper because, inter alia, G.S. 45-21.16 did not guarantee a right to a jury determination of the type of issues to be resolved by a hearing

                        Measure of Damages. - The language of this section is considerably broader than the language under either G.S. 45-21.34 or G.S. 1-292. It must be concluded, therefore, that the legislature intended that the courts have great latitude in measuring damages
                        under this section. In re Simon, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 243 S.E.2d 163 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Interest accruing on the indebtedness during the pendency of a stay would be a proper measure of damages under a bond conforming to the language of this section. In re Simon, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 243 S.E.2d

                        Request for Equitable Relief Denied. - Superior court correctly declined to address the plaintiff/bank's argument for equitable relief, as such an action would have exceeded its permissible scope of review in a foreclosure action. Espinosa v. Martin,
                        <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 520 S.E.2d 108 (1999).

                        Testimony of Trustee Held Proper. - Where the debtors challenged the trial court's jurisdiction on the grounds that the trustee's service of the notice of hearing was inadequate, the trial court properly allowed the foreclosing creditor to rebut the debtors'
                        assertion by calling the trustees as witness and inquiring as to his efforts to serve the debtors, since the trustee had a statutory duty to effect valid service of process and did not adversely affect his proper status as a "disinterested
                        third party" in the deed of trust relationship. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop. Under Deed of Trust from Brown, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 577 S.E.2d 398 (2003).

                        Admission of Affidavit Held Proper. - Necessity for expeditious procedure in foreclosure actions substantially outweighed any concerns about the efficacy of allowing a loan servicer's employee, who lived out of state, to testify by affidavit, and the
                        trial court properly admitted her affidavit into evidence. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop. Under Deed of Trust from Brown, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 577 S.E.2d 398 (2003).

                        Proof of Service. - Homeowners were entitled to attack foreclosure proceeding either by a motion in the cause or by an independent action where the officer's return was insufficient on its face to show service upon homeowner husband in that the return
                        did not show the place where the papers were left. Hassell v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 307</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 77 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although an officer's return was insufficient to show service upon plaintiff husband in mortgage foreclosure proceedings because it did not show the place where the papers were left, such defect was not necessarily fatal to the foreclosure proceedings;
                        the matter would be remanded for the trial judge to determine, within his discretion, whether the sheriff's return ought to be amended so as to comport with facts regarding the place and manner of service. Hassell v. Wilson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 307</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 77 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Service by Posting. - This section allows service upon a party by posting the notice only in those instances where the party's name and address are not reasonably ascertainable; otherwise, posting will suffice only when "supplemented" by notice mailed
                        to the party's last known address or by personal service. Federal Land Bank v. Lackey, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 380 S.E.2d 538 (1989), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 478</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Under this section, service by posting may run concurrently with any other effort to effect service; therefore, when the notice was posted on the property concurrent with the attempt to serve defendants by mail, the notice requirement was satisfied. McArdle

                    <p>
                        Mortgagor was properly served with process by posting because such service was proper when service by publication, under G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j1), was allowed, and Rule 4(j1) was interpreted in the disjunctive, so a mortgagee did not have to try
                        all other methods of service listed in the Rule. In re Powell, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 768 S.E.2d 133 (2014).

                        Mortgagee exercised due diligence in attempting to serve a mortgagor with notice of a foreclosure hearing, authorizing service by posting, since service by publication was authorized, because the mortgagee not only unsuccessfully attempted service by
                        certified mail, return receipt requested, which would have sufficed, but the mortgagor also unsuccessfully attempted service by personal delivery. In re Powell, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite>                        441, 768 S.E.2d 133 (2014).

                        Original Obligor Entitled to Notice. - Where original obligors negotiated a deed of trust with trustee, and second obligors assumed the loan but original obligors were not released and remained personally liable for the debt, trial court erred in granting
                        summary judgment to trustee since original obligor was not properly served with notice; though second obligors assumed the original obligor's loan, original obligor remained personally liable for the debt and accordingly, he was
                        entitled to notice of any foreclosure hearing. Federal Land Bank v. Lackey, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 380 S.E.2d 538 (1989), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 478</cite>, 390 S.E.2d

                        Subordinate Lienholder Entitled to Notice. - If a trustee owed a fiduciary duty to the subordinate lienholder, the trustee conceivably would be compelled to give the subordinate lienholder notice of the foreclosure sale so that the subordinate lienholder
                        could enforce its rights, and this result is appropriate because it is incumbent upon a subordinate lienholder to contemplate the risk associated with subordinating its right to payment to that of a higher priority lienholder;
                        the subordinate lienholder is not left without recourse because it has an adequate means to compensate for this risk by charging a higher interest rate on the debt, and therefore, in the context of a foreclosure sale, only a foreclosing
                        lienholder may bring a claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the trustee of a deed of trust being foreclosed upon. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Vogler Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 389</cite>,

                        Requirements of Notice. - Subsection (c) lists the information the notice of hearing must contain and does not include a requirement that the notice contain the names of the parties entitled to notice, nor is such a requirement implied by the statute

                        Notice Held Sufficient. - In a foreclosure action, a loan servicer's efforts to serve the debtors prior to posting the property by mailing notice to the address of the subject real property (though the debtors no longer lived there) were "reasonable and
                        diligent" within the meaning of G.S. 45-21.16(a), in light of the fact that the debtors had actual notice of the hearing. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop.

                        Superior court properly found that a bank met the notice criteria of the statute because the purchaser of the property and the sellers received proper notice of the initial hearing before the clerk of court; the sellers did not appeal the clerk of court's
                        decision, and the purchaser made no showing on appeal regarding how he had been prejudiced by or how he had standing to contest the adequacy of the notice to the sellers of the hearing on his appeal. Greene v. Tr. Servs. of Carolina,

                        It was no error to deny a mortgagee's motion to set aside a homeowners' association's foreclosure because (1) the mortgagee had notice mailed to an address the mortgagee gave in prior communications, and (2) the mortgagee did not timely object within
                        one year. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop. Under Deed of Trust from Garrett, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 795 S.E.2d 1 (2016).

                        Notice Held Insufficient. - The clerk of court erred in permitting a foreclosure sale of property pursuant to a deed of trust where the debtor was not given notice of the foreclosure hearing in a manner prescribed by subsection (a) of this section, a
                        letter to and telephone conservation with the debtor being insufficient and the debtor's actual knowledge of the hearing being irrelevant. PMB, Inc. v.

                        Original obligor's name and address were reasonably ascertainable, and the trustee testified he had original obligor's name and address in his files; therefore, where plaintiff gave notice to original obligor of the foreclosure hearing by posting notice
                        on the property, plaintiff's failure to supplement constructive notice with notice by mail failed to comply with the minimum due process requirements. Federal Land Bank v. Lackey, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite>                        553, 380 S.E.2d 538 (1989), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 478</cite>, 390 S.E.2d 138 (1990).

                        Where plaintiff's sole attempt at personal service of notice consisted of a certified letter mailed to the business address of a partnership, a postal box number, this solitary venture constituted neither application of "due diligence" as required by
                        Rule 4(j1) nor a "reasonable and diligent effort" as required by subsection (a). Barclays American/Mortgage Corp. v. BECA Enters., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 446 S.E.2d 883 (1994).

                        Trial court correctly determined a foreclosure sale was void due to lack of personal jurisdiction over the homeowner because the foreclosure trustee failed to serve all record owners of the property; the attempted service of the notice of foreclosure
                        upon the homeowner by leaving a copy at the property was inadequate because the property was not his dwelling house or usual place of abode. In re Proposed Foreclosure of Claim of Lien Filed on George,

                        Notice Not Fatally Defective. - Notice of a foreclosure hearing before the clerk of court was not fatally defective in that the notice, dated December 8, 1978, stated that the hearing would be held on January 3, 1978, rather than 1979. Lovell v. Rowan

                        Mortgage company, not a purchaser in a foreclosure sale, was not a party protected by G.S. 45-21.21 and was entitled to notice under G.S. 45-21.16 only if it filed a request for notice under G.S. 45-21.17A, which it did not; because the mortgage company
                        was not entitled to notice of sale, it had no standing to dispute the adequacy of that notice on appeal nor did it have standing to argue that the sale was held on a holiday in contravention of G.S. 45-21.23. Beneficial Mortg.

                        If a bankruptcy petition is filed (1) after the notice and hearing provided for in G.S. 45-21.16 has been completed and (2) after the clerk of superior court has authorized the foreclosure and (3) prior to the expiration of the upset bid period, then

                        and sell it in accordance with G.S. 45-21.1 and G.S. 45-21.17A; thus, where the debtors filed for an automatic stay after a mortgagee had started foreclosure proceedings but before the 10 day upset period, once the stay was annulled
                        by the bankruptcy judge, the foreclosing trustee was required to pursue foreclosure again by readvertising and selling the property in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 45-21.16A, 45-21.17, and 45-21.17A. Beneficial Mortg.

                        Waiver of Notice. - Where a party to a foreclosure hearing argued that he received no notice of the hearing, but the record on appeal showed that he was present at the hearing and participated in it, the party would be held to have waived notice of the
                        foreclosure hearing. In re Norton, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 255 S.E.2d 287 (1979).

                        Second Proceeding Set Aside Where Debt Satisfied in Prior Proceeding. - The mortgage indebtedness that a substitute trustee sought to collect in a foreclosure proceeding instituted in Davidson County, upon a tract of land located partly in Davidson and
                        Randolph counties, was paid off in full during a prior foreclosure in Randolph County. Thus, this second foreclosure was without foundation and the order of the trial court authorizing the foreclosure was set aside. In re Rollins,

                        Payment Delinquent Where One Day Past Due. - The 30-day grace period contained in the original promissory note was contained in the clause governing the lender's right to accelerate the debt, and the loan modification agreement contained a new acceleration
                        clause, which provided that the lender could accelerate the debt in the event one monthly payment became "delinquent." The judge properly gave the word "delinquent" its plain meaning, i.e., overdue or late. Consequently, it was
                        clear that the debtor became delinquent in making his payment one day after the agreement provided it was due. In re Fortescue, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 330 S.E.2d 219, cert. denied,

                        Mortgagors, by joining in consent order, not only waived their right to appeal from final adjudication based thereon, but also left the case with no unresolved issue to appeal, even though their appeal to the judge was not from the consent order but from
                        the clerk's follow-up order authorizing foreclosure, since the consent order established that the foreclosure issue would be finally set at rest by the subsequent order, and the parties, in effect, agreed and consented to the subsequent
                        order as well. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 395, 363 S.E.2d 380 (1988).

                        Bonds on Appeal. - This section governs only the bond covering the appeal from the clerk to the trial court; bonds for appeals from the traditional trial courts to the Court of Appeals in foreclosure actions are governed by G.S. 1-292. In re Simon,
                        <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 243 S.E.2d 163 (1978).

                    <p>
                        In foreclosure proceedings a clerk may require a bond by an appealing respondent pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, and a superior court judge may require a bond upon appeal from that court pursuant to G.S. 1-292, and if the bond is not posted,
                        the trustee may proceed with the foreclosure; however, neither statute gives the clerk or the judge the power to make the posting of a bond a condition to the appeal, and it is error for the superior court to dismiss an appeal
                        from that court when the bond required by the court is not posted. In re Coley Properties, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 273 S.E.2d 738 (1981).

                        With respect to debtors' objection to creditors' secured claim, res judicata did not bar debtors from litigating validity of Note and Deed of Trust underlying claim because state court foreclosure judgment was on appeal, meaning that judgment was not
                        final, and failure to post bond did not affect validity of appeal. Huff v. Gallagher (In re Huff), 521 B.R. 107 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Dec. 5, 2014).

                        Payment of Bond to Bank. - Because the superior court correctly found that all six elements of the statute were satisfied, it properly ordered the bond paid to the bank.

                        Finding of No Default Proper. - Trial court's judgment denying foreclosure was proper because an owner's testimony that the mortgage company returned the owners' payment check to the owners and failed to respond to the owners' attempts to communicate
                        with it supported the trial court's finding of fact that there was no default. In re Foreclosure of Bigelow, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 649 S.E.2d 10 (2007).

        Res Judicata Applied to Federal Action.
       </b> - Court found that the borrowers failed to appeal the order of foreclosure to the superior court within the requisite time period. The borrowers also failed to file a separate action in superior court to enjoin the
                        foreclosure sales on equitable grounds; as such, res judicata prevented relitigation of the order permitting foreclosure of the property. Mixon v. Wells Fargo Home Mortg., - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. Apr. 13, 2012).

                        Two Dismissal Rule Not Applicable. - Trial court erred in finding that a bank's claim for judicial foreclosure was barred under the "two dismissal rule" because a judicial foreclosure was not a type of special proceeding limited in scope and jurisdiction;
                        the bank could not have brought a claim for judicial foreclosure in the same action as its claims for foreclosure by power of sale because a judicial foreclosure could be pursued by a creditor after a foreclosure by power of sale
                        failed. Lifestore Bank v. Mingo Tribal Preservation Trust Dated January 4, 1993, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 763 S.E.2d 6 (2014).

                        Nonjudicial Foreclosure Sale Under Reverse Mortgage. - Nonjudicial foreclosure sale of property for failure to make payments under a promissory note was authorized, under a reverse mortgage, based on the power-of-sale provision in a deed of trust, because,
                        although the borrower's widow signed the deed of trust as a borrower, the terms of the borrower's note and loan agreement, in conjunction with the widow's statutory ineligibility to qualify as a reverse-mortgage borrower, excluded
                        the widow as a surviving borrower as contemplated by the deed of trust's acceleration provision. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop.

                        Statute of Limitations. - Assignee was squarely within the requisite time frame in which it could bring its foreclosure action because the statute of limitations did not run until ten years after a final payment was made on an obligation, and a corporation
                        made payments pursuant to the terms of a reorganization plan. In re Foreclosure of a N.C. Deed of Trust, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 764 S.E.2d 221 (2014).

                        Effect of Remand to Trial Court. - Appellate court's earlier remand to the trial court to make the findings and conclusions required by statute did not prevent the trial court from making those required findings and conclusions, even if no new default
                        was shown. In re Forclosure of a Deed of Trust Executed by Worsham, - N.C. App. - , 833 S.E.2d 239 (2019), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 268</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 350, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 292 (N.C.

                        Foreclosure and sale pursuant to the statutory scheme of this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 was prospectively unlawful and void unless the power of sale was determined by the clerk to be a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of
                        due process rights under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, or the clerk determined that there had been adequate and timely notice to the mortgagor, coupled with opportunity for a hearing, before any rights were lost. Turner v. Blackburn,

                        Purpose of Notice. - The principal object in publishing notice of sale of mortgaged property in the exercise of a power of sale is not so much to notify the grantor or mortgagor as it is to inform the public generally, so that bidders may be present at
                        the sale and a fair price may be obtained. Huggins v. Dement, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 673, 187 S.E.2d 412, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 314</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 898, appeal

        Guaranty Agreements.

                        rights such as those in guaranty agreements do not fall within the statute's coverage. Private third party guarantors of loans are not required by the statute to give notice to those whose obligations they guarantee before seeking
                        indemnity from them. Any notice requirement in such a situation is imposed by the contract between the parties, not by the antideficiency statute. Boley v. Principi, 144 F.R.D. 305 (E.D.N.C. 1992), aff'd sub nom., Boley v. Brown,

                        the mortgage company was not entitled to notice of sale, it had no standing to dispute the adequacy of that notice on appeal nor did it have standing to argue that the sale was held on a holiday in contravention of G.S. 45-21.23.

                        Requirement to Readvertise After Lifting of Automatic Stay. - If a bankruptcy petition is filed (1) after the notice and hearing provided for in G.S. 45-21.16 has been completed and (2) after the clerk of superior court has authorized the foreclosure
                        and (3) prior to the expiration of the upset bid period, then if the automatic stay of 11 U.S.C.S.

                        and sell it in accordance with G.S. 45-21.1 and G.S. 45-21.17A; thus, where the debtors filed for an automatic stay after a mortgagee had started foreclosure proceedings but before the 10 day upset period, once the stay was annulled
                        by the bankruptcy judge, the foreclosing trustee was required to pursue foreclosure again by readvertising and selling the property in accordance with the provisions of G.S. 45-21.16A, 45-21.17, and 45-21.17A. Beneficial Mortg.

                        mortgage company was not entitled to notice of sale, it had no standing to dispute the adequacy of that notice on appeal nor did it have standing to argue that the sale was held on a holiday in contravention of G.S. 45-21.23. Beneficial

                        Payment of Mortgage Within 10-Day Period. - The last and highest bidder at a foreclosure sale of a mortgage on lands is but a proposed purchaser acquiring no right until the statutory provision of 10 days has expired, and the payment of the full mortgage
                        indebtedness to the mortgagee within that time cancels the instrument and all rights arising thereunder. In such case no recovery of damages can be had by the bidder against the mortgagor or a purchaser from him to whom the equity

                        The one who is the last and highest bidder at the foreclosure of a mortgage or deed of trust on lands is but a proposed purchaser within the 10 days before confirmation, and where the mortgagee has become such purchaser and within the 10 days allowed
                        by statute for an increase bid a third person pays the mortgage debt and has the notes and mortgage assigned to him, such person has the right of lien and foreclosure under the terms of the mortgage securing the note. Davis v.

      </b> - Session Laws 2018-40, s. 11.1, which amended this section, is located in Part XI of Session Laws 2018-40. Section 11.2 of that act provides, "This section becomes effective July 1, 2018, and applies to foreclosure sales
                    noticed on or after that date." The reference to "This section" in Section 11.2 appears to have been in error and "This Part" was apparently the intended wording. Section 15 of the act provides that except as otherwise provided, the

                        Persons Protected by Section. - This section provides procedural protections for a mortgagor, not for the purchaser of property, who acts at his own risk and has no basis to assert a sale is invalid because it is postponed in a manner inconsistent with
                        this section. Gore v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 620, 279 S.E.2d 102 (1981).

                        Mortgage company, not a purchaser in a foreclosure sale, was not a party protected by G.S. 45-21.21 and was entitled to notice under G.S. 45-21.16 only if it filed a request for notice under G.S. 45-21.17A, which it did not; because the mortgage company
                        was not entitled to notice of sale, it had no standing to dispute the adequacy of that notice on appeal nor did it have standing to argue that the sale was held on a holiday in contravention of G.S. 45-21.23. Beneficial Mortg.

                        the trustee does not violate the fiduciary duty of the office, and does not give unfair advantages to any party, the exercise of that discretion is not reviewable by the courts. Sprouse v. North River Ins. Co.,

        Court Should Have Set New Sale Date and Period for Notice.
       </b> - Whether by stating that the temporary restraining order was "dissolved" or by denying the motion for a preliminary injunction, the state court judge effectively "dissolved an order restraining or enjoining the sale"
                        and he should have set a new sale date and period for notice. G.S 45-21.22(b) (and, similarly, G.S. 45.21.22(c), which applies when a bankruptcy petition is filed during the upset bid period and the automatic stay is subsequently
                        terminated) contemplates that a new sale will be conducted with some notice period, not that the upset bid period will resume for whatever time was remaining when the injunction was entered, after an injunction is issued and dissolved;
                        here, because no new sale date was set, the property was still owned by debtor. In re Highway 751 Partners, LLC, 52 Bankr. Ct. Dec. 126 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Dec. 3, 2009).

                        Objection to Sale on a Holiday - Mortgage company, not a purchaser in a foreclosure sale, was not a party protected by G.S. 45-21.21 and was entitled to notice under G.S. 45-21.16 only if it filed a request for notice under G.S. 45-21.17A, which it did

It should be noted that former G.S. 45-28 applied to foreclosure by order of court, to execution sales, and to sales by personal representatives and sales by any person pursuant to a power contained in a will, as well as to sales under power of sale contained in a mortgage or deed of trust. Many of the cases below were decided prior to the 1993 amendments to Articles 2A and 2B, which clarified the procedure for foreclosure under power of sale and established a new upset bid procedure.

                    <p>
                        Legislative Intent. - Former G.S. 45-28 was intended for the protection of mortgagors where sales were made under a power of sale without a decree of foreclosure by the court. In the latter cases there was always an equity to decree a resale when a substantial
                        raise in the bid, usually 10%, had been deposited in court. There being no such protection as to mortgages with power of sale, this statute was passed to extend to mortgagors, whose property had been sold under power of sale without
                        a decree of foreclosure, the same opportunity of a resale. Pringle v. Winston-Salem Bldg. &amp; Loan Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 316</cite>, 108 S.E. 914 (1921).

                    <p>
                        The intent is to extend to private foreclosure sales an effective equivalent of an equity court's power to decree a resale upon the filing of a substantial raised bid. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975).

                    <p>
                        Liberal Construction. - Under former G.S. 45-28 it was held that, while the clerk of the superior court is without authority to order a resale of lands foreclosed under a mortgage without an increase bid filed with him and the payment of the deposit required,
                        the provisions of the statute relating thereto are to be liberally construed to effectuate its intent to protect the mortgagor. Clayton Banking Co. v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 534</cite>, 149

                        Advanced Bids by Mortgagor or Trustor. - Under former G.S. 45-28, the mortgagor or trustor was entitled to procure resales through advanced bids made in conformity with the statute. In re Sale of Land of Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 412</cite>,

                        Supervisory Powers of Clerk. - The supervisory powers invested in the clerk of the court over sales under a mortgage, deed of trust, etc., by former G.S. 45-28 were not those of general control as exercised by the courts in case of an ordinary judicial
                        sale, but were confined by the statute to sales and resales under the power of sale contained in the instruments, and in accordance with the directions of the statute. Lawrence v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 196</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Under former G.S. 45-28 it was held that the clerk of the court acquired supervisory power of the sale of land under power contained in a mortgage or deed of trust from the time of an advanced bid paid into his hands, which continued until after the final
                        sale under foreclosure. Lawrence v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 196</cite>, 116 S.E. 424 (1923).

                        As to the supervisory powers given the clerks of the superior courts by former G.S. 45-28, the statute was to be strictly complied with. Redfern v. McGrady, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 128</cite>, 154 S.E. 3 (1930).

                        Under former G.S. 45-28 the jurisdiction of the clerk vested at the moment an upset bid was filed with him. Thereafter he had supervisory power over the sale which continued until after the final sale and confirmation thereof. Foust v. Gate City Sav.

                        allowed there had been an increased bid, etc., and did not extend to instances wherein a material loss had been sustained by destruction of a house on the lands within the stated period. In re Sermon's Land,

                        Statutory Period for Filing Upset Bid. - This section provides that an upset bid may be filed with the clerk of superior court at any time within 10 days after the filing of the report of sale. Obviously, if no report of sale has been filed, the 10-day
                        limitation has not begun to run. The trial court committed error in ordering the substitute trustee to convey the properties in accordance with the foreclosure proceedings thus far. The sales should remain open for an upset bid
                        for a period of 10 days from the date this opinion is certified to the clerk of superior court. Carlisle v. Commodore Corp., <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 650, 190 S.E.2d 703 (1972).

                        The issuance and service of the temporary restraining order on the substitute trustee halted all proceedings under the foreclosure and tolled the running of the statutory period of 10 days for filing an upset bid. Only nine days elapsed between the date
                        of the sale and the date the substitute trustee was restrained. If the report of sale had been filed on the day of the sale, one day of the statutory 10-day period for filing an upset bid would remain. If the report of sale had
                        been filed on the fifth day after the sale, the maximum time allowed under G.S. 45-21.26, five days of the statutory period of 10 days for filing an upset bid would remain. Carlisle v. Commodore Corp.,

        Effect of Automatic Bankruptcy Stay on Redemption Period.
       </b> - Although the stay created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition is not the same as an injunction granted pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, the filing of an upset bid in North Carolina is prohibited by the automatic stay
                        of
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the running of the period during which a debtor may redeem property in North Carolina is tied to the running of the upset bid period, the automatic stay prevents the running of the
                        redemption period as well. In other words, even though the automatic bankruptcy stay does not directly suspend the running of the state statutory redemption period, it indirectly has that effect by preventing the expiration of
                        the ten-day upset bid period. In re DiCello, 80 Bankr. 769 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1987).

                        had not expired under G.S. 45-21.27(a) when the debtor filed bankruptcy after the close of business on March 25, which would otherwise have been the 10th day; thus the bankruptcy court vacated its prior order granting the creditors
                        relief from the automatic stay. In re Country Lake Enters., 284 B.R. 223 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2002).

    §
   </span> 362 of the Bankruptcy Code has the effect of preventing the expiration of the 10-day upset bid period provided for in G.S. 45-21.22, when the debtor files for bankruptcy within that period, thereby preventing the fixing
                        of any rights as to any subject real property protected by a stay as the upset bid period has not run; therefore, where a first mortgagee was the last and highest bidder of a foreclosure trustee's public sale of the debtors' property
                        but the debtors filed for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> bankruptcy and stayed the foreclosure, the sale could not be completed and no parties rights as to the property

                        only considered as a preferred bidder, his right depending upon whether there is an increased bid and a resale of the land ordered under the provisions of the statute. In re Sermon's Land, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 122</cite>,

                        of lands during the 10 days allowed for the filing of upset bids, for, within that time, there is no binding contract of purchase, and the bargain is incomplete. In re Sermon's Land, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 122</cite>,

                        Revocation of Order for Deed. - It is the duty of the clerk of the superior court to readvertise and resell the mortgaged property as often as the statute is complied with, and the last and highest bidder at a prior sale acquires no rights in the property
                        until his bid has finally been accepted and the order made for the deed to be made to him; and such order having been made by the clerk prematurely, it is proper for him to make an entry revoking it and order a resale, and an injunction

                        of the full mortgage indebtedness to the mortgagee within that time cancels the instrument and all rights arising thereunder. In such case no recovery of damages can be had by the bidder against the mortgagor or a purchaser from

                        of making an advance bid to deposit 15% of such bid in cash or certified or cashier's check. In re Sale of Land of Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 412</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 302 (1949).

                        Time of Making Deposit. - Under repealed G.S. 45-28 it was held that when, within the statutory time limit, the offerer had communicated with the clerk of the court by telephone and offered to come from an adjacent town and make a sufficient deposit and
                        was informed by the clerk that it would be sufficient to send a cashier's check by mail on that day, and a good cashier's check was accordingly mailed, a substantial compliance with the statute was made, though the check was received
                        by the clerk after the expiration of the time limit of the statute. Clayton Banking Co. v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 534</cite>, 149 S.E. 689 (1929).

                        when the last purchaser was an innocent purchaser for value in good faith. Brown v. Sheets, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 268</cite>, 148 S.E. 233 (1929). See also, Phipps v. Wyatt, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 727</cite>,

                        Effect of Recitals in Deed as to Compliance with Statute. - Where the question in controversy in a suit for specific performance against the purchaser is whether there has been a compliance with former G.S. 45-28 as to a resale under a mortgage upon the
                        raise of a bid at a prior sale, the recitals relating thereto in the deed tendered by the mortgagor are only prima facie evidence of such facts, and standing alone are insufficient to sustain the judgment. Briggs v. Asheville Developers,

                        Jurisdiction of Judge on Appeal. - The discretion vested in the superior court judge on appeal from the clerk, under G.S. 1-276 [see now G.S. 1-301.1 et seq.], to hear and determine the matter in controversy, cannot confer jurisdiction on the judge to
                        pass upon the reasonableness of the price of land sold under the power of sale in a mortgage, for the clerk has no authority to further pass thereon in the absence of an increased bid. In re Mortgage Sale of Ware Property,

                    <p>
                        Dismissal of Request to Enjoin Foreclosure Not Error. - Trial court did not err by dismissing as untimely and moot plaintiff's request to enjoin a foreclosure under G.S. 45-21.34 because given that no upset bid was filed by the expiration of the ten-day
                        period prescribed in G.S. 45-21.27 and that plaintiff did not obtain injunctive relief by the time that the upset bid period expired, the rights of the parties to the sale became fixed, rendering plaintiff's application moot; given
                        that the foreclosure sale became final before plaintiff obtained any sort of injunctive relief, plaintiff was left without the ability to prevent the consummation of the foreclosure on the property, since a court could not restrain
                        the doing of an act which already had been consummated. Goad v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 704 S.E.2d 1 (2010).

                        Irregularity Requiring Vacation of Confirmation and Deed. - After upset bid under former G.S. 45-28, the property in suit, having a market value of from $5,500.00 to $6,000.00, was actually sold for $825.00. The trustee erroneously reported the bid as
                        $6,400.00, which report was on record in the clerk's office from the date of the sale until confirmation. It was held that the irregularity was of such substantial nature as to require a court of equity to vacate the confirmation
                        and the deed pursuant thereto without requiring the trustors to prove that anyone was misled or failed to file an upset bid by reason of the erroneous report. Foust v. Gate City Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n,

                        Mootness of Appeal. - Property owner's and the secured creditor's rights in the subject real property were fixed and the owner's appeal was moot because the subject real property was sold and the trustee's deed was recorded. There was no indication in
                        the record that the owner paid a bond to stay the foreclosure sale, under G.S. 1-292; nor was there an upset bid during the 10 day period pursuant to G.S. 45-21.29A, or any indication in the record that the owner obtained a temporary
                        restraining order or preliminary injunction prior to the end of the ten-day upset bid period. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Hackley, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 713 S.E.2d

                        Upset Bid Period Properly Reopened. - Superior court properly granted a junior lender's motion to reopen the upset bid period in a power-of-sale foreclosure action and extended the upset bid period for an additional 10 days because the lender, as the
                        last prior bidder with interests in the collateral real property that stood to be eliminated by the foreclosure proceeding, did not receive notice of a third-party's upset bid in sufficient time to protect its interests. In re

         Many of the cases were decided under repealed G.S. 45-28, which was similar to G.S. 45-21.27, former G.S. 45-21.28, this section and G.S. 45-21.30, and under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975. Most of the cases below were decided prior to the 1993 amendments to Articles 2A and 2B, which clarified the procedure for foreclosure under power of sale and established a new upset bid procedure.

        Constitutionality.
       </b> - For case holding the statutes providing procedure for real property mortgage foreclosure, sale, and eviction under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 are unconstitutional as applied, see Turner v.
                        Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975).

                        Foreclosure and sale pursuant to the statutory scheme of this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 was prospectively unlawful and void unless the power of sale was determined by the clerk to be a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of
                        due process rights under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, or the clerk determined that there had been adequate and timely notice to the mortgagor, coupled with opportunity for a hearing, before any rights were lost. Turner v. Blackburn,
                        389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975).

                        Clerk of the court is barred by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV from working a deprivation of the mortgagor's property without prior notice and an opportunity for a timely hearing, unless it is clear that those rights have been expressly waived. Turner v. Blackburn,

        Minimum Requirements of Due Process.
       </b> - At a minimum, due process requires the trustee to make an initial showing before the clerk or similar neutral official that the mortgagor is in default under the obligation; the mortgagor must of course be afforded
                        the opportunity to rebut and defend the charges. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975).

                        Clerk to Order Resale After Each Upset Bid. - Under former G.S. 45-28 it was held that the clerk of the superior court was required to order a resale of property foreclosed under power contained in a deed of trust each time an advance bid was made in
                        accordance with the statute, regardless of how often an upset bid might be placed. In re Sale of Land of Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 412</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 302 (1949). See note to G.S. 45-21.27

        Effect of Automatic Bankruptcy Stay on Redemption Period.
       </b> - Although the stay created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition is not the same as an injunction granted pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, the filing of an upset bid in North Carolina is prohibited by the automatic stay
                        of
                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the running of the period during which a debtor may redeem property in North Carolina is tied to the running of the upset bid period, the automatic stay prevents the running of the
                        redemption period as well. In other words, even though the automatic bankruptcy stay does not directly suspend the running of the state statutory redemption period, it indirectly has that effect by preventing the expiration of
                        the ten-day upset bid period. In re DiCello, 80 Bankr. 769 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1987).

                        Striking Out Order for Resale. - Where, on account of an upset bid, an order for a resale has been entered, it is error 11 days thereafter to strike out such order and declare the sale final, in prejudice of further rights of mortgagors. Virginia Trust

                        Inadequacy of Purchase Price. - Mere inadequacy of the purchase price realized at a foreclosure sale, standing alone, is not sufficient to upset a sale duly and regularly made in strict conformity with the power of sale. In re Register,
                        <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 167 S.E.2d 802 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Where there is an irregularity in the sale, gross inadequacy of purchase price may be considered on the question of the materiality of the irregularity. In re Register, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 167 S.E.2d 802
                        (1969).

                    <p>
                        Gross inadequacy of consideration, when coupled with any other inequitable element, even though neither, standing alone, may be sufficient for the purpose, will induce a court of equity to interpose and do justice between the parties. In re Register,

                        The order of the clerk to deliver title required by former G.S. 45-28 was merely ministerial in its nature, and its omission, when in fact the trustee had, after complying with all the terms of the power of sale, made title to the purchaser, did not invalidate
                        the foreclosure or render the title acquired by the purchaser as grantee in the deed of the trustee void. Cheek v. Squires, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 661</cite>, 158 S.E. 198 (1931). See also, Lawrence

                        Application To Enjoin Foreclosure Sale Must Be Filed Before Upset Bid Period Expires. - Trial court did not err by dismissing as untimely and moot plaintiff's request to enjoin a foreclosure under G.S. 45-21.34 because given that no upset bid was filed
                        by the expiration of the ten-day period prescribed in G.S. 45-21.27 and that plaintiff did not obtain injunctive relief by the time that the upset bid period expired, the rights of the parties to the sale became fixed, rendering
                        plaintiff's application moot; given that the foreclosure sale became final before plaintiff obtained any sort of injunctive relief, plaintiff was left without the ability to prevent the consummation of the foreclosure on the property,

        When Right to Equity of Redemption Is Lost.
       </b> - In nonjudicial foreclosures where no upset bid is filed, the rights of the parties to the foreclosure sale, i.e., the rights of the trustee under the deed of trust being foreclosed (as seller) and the rights of the
                        purchaser, become fixed at the expiration of the 10-day period for the filing of upset bids. It is at this point that the debtor loses his rights to the equity of redemption he had in the real estate. Cooper v. Smith, 24 Bankr.
                        19 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1982).

                    <p>
                        It was undisputed that ten days passed after the report of the November 12, 2004 foreclosure sale was filed without any upset bids being submitted. Thus, when this case was filed on November 23, 2004, debtor had no right of redemption under North Carolina
                        law with respect to the property and had no right to cure with respect to the indebtedness of the creditor under federal bankruptcy law. In re Holt, - Bankr. - (Bankr. M.D.N.C. June 3, 2005).

                    <p>
                        As, under North Carolina law, legal ownership of debtor's property passed to purchaser when foreclosure sale upset bid closed, adequate grounds and good cause existed to grant purchaser relief from automatic stay. In re Daniel, - Bankr. - (Bankr. M.D.N.C.

                        Bankruptcy debtor was not entitled to cure a default under a note and deed of trust against the debtor's real property in the debtor's plan, since a foreclosure sale of the property was completed under state law regardless of whether a trustee's deed
                        was delivered, and the debtor's right of redemption expired before the bankruptcy case was filed. In re Dillard, - Bankr. - (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Aug. 22, 2000).

                        Equitable Relief Not Timely Sought. - Mortgagor's claim of "fraud upon the court" failed because, inter alia, the mortgagor did not timely seek equitable relief after rights of the parties were fixed. Wilson v. SunTrust Bank,

                        Mootness of Appeal. - Property owner's and the secured creditor's rights in the subject real property were fixed and the owner's appeal was moot because the subject real property was sold and the trustee's deed was recorded. There was no indication in
                        the record that the owner paid a bond to stay the foreclosure sale, under G.S. 1-292; nor was there an upset bid during the 10 day period pursuant to G.W. 45-21.29A, or any indication in the record that the owner obtained a temporary
                        restraining order or preliminary injunction prior to the end of the ten-day upset bid period. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Hackley, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 713 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Mortgagors' argument attacking the consummation of foreclosure by power sale proceeding was moot because the mortgagors did not apply for a temporary stay or injunction, pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, on the ground that the superior court lacked subject matter
                        jurisdiction to authorize the sale; thus; the foreclosure sale was consummated, and the parties' rights in the real property were fixed, in accordance with G.S. 45-21.29A. In re Foreclosure of the Nine Deeds of Trust of Marshall

                        Deposit When No Upset Bid Is Made. - Under the provisions of former G.S. 45-28, the last and highest bidder at a foreclosure sale obtained no interest in the land until the elapse of the 10-day period for the filing of an increased bid, and although the
                        mortgagee or trustee might, in fixing the terms of the sale, require a reasonable cash deposit to cover the cost of the sale and insure completion of the sale by the purchaser if no upset bid was made, the reasonableness of such
                        deposit might be determined by analogy to the deposit required for an upset bid, and a demand for a cash deposit at the sale amounting to 25% of the bid was unreasonable. Alexander v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 103</cite>,

                        Recovery of Deposit When Resale Is Ordered. - Where the last and highest bidder at a sale of lands has been required to deposit a certain percentage of his bid in cash to show his good faith, he is entitled to receive his deposit back upon the placing
                        of an advanced bid and cash deposit by another and the entering of an order of resale by the clerk. Koonce v. Fort, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 426</cite>, 168 S.E. 672 (1933), decided under former G.S.

                    <p>
                        The deposit required by former G.S. 45-28 was to guarantee against loss in a resale of land under foreclosure sale of a mortgage, and where the clerk of the superior court required of a person placing an advanced bid a deposit representing a 5% increase
                        bid, and in addition a deposit to guarantee compliance with the bid, and the lands were resold and bought in by the one making the advanced bid, and he refused to pay the amount because of threatened litigation, and the lands were
                        again resold and brought a surplus over that of the prior resale, there was no loss occasioned by the first resale, and the person making the deposit therefor was entitled to received it back as against the claim therefor of one
                        holding a note secured by a junior mortgage on the same property. Harris v. American Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 605</cite>, 152 S.E. 802 (1930), decided under G.S. 45-28.

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in holding a defaulting bidder liable for the costs of resale because the bidder was statutorily entitled to a refund of its entire deposit where the final sale price clearly exceeded the bidder's defaulting bid plus the costs of resale.

                        Discretion of Trustee. - The trustee has substantial discretion in discharging his responsibilities, which are to attempt to satisfy the debt while getting the highest price for the mortgagor and protecting the mortgagor's rights and equity. As long as
                        the trustee does not violate the fiduciary duty of the office, and does not give unfair advantages to any party, the exercise of that discretion is not reviewable by the courts. Sprouse v. North River Ins. Co.,

                        New Hearing Improper. - Trial court erred in allowing trustee to hold a new hearing and sale in foreclosure proceeding which added a new deficiency debtor, after the assistant clerk had held a foreclosure hearing and sale, and the sale of the property
                        had been confirmed by passage of the upset bid period. In re Earl L. Pickett Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 442 S.E.2d 101 (1994).

                        Insurable Interest of Mortgagor. - In a foreclosure, until the purchase price is paid and the deed is delivered, the mortgagor retains some interests in the property. These interests constitute some sufficient risk of pecuniary loss and chance of benefit
                        that the mortgagor has an insurable interest in the property. Sprouse v. North River Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 344 S.E.2d 555, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 284</cite>,

                        Withdrawal of Upset Bid for Mistake Held Error. - Order permitting an individual to withdraw his upset bid and requiring a resale of foreclosed property, based on the court's finding that he made his bid in the mistaken belief, due to negligently failing
                        to inform himself as to the land that he was bidding on, that he was bidding on all three parcels of land covered by deed of trust, rather than just two, was in error, as there was no equitable basis for allowing him to withdraw
                        it. When the bid was accepted by the trustee as the last and highest, a contract was made, and the mere mistake of one party alone is not sufficient to avoid a contract. In re Allan &amp; Warmbold Constr. Co.,

                        Disbursement of Defaulting Bid Deposit. - Trial court did not err in ordering that a bid deposit made by a defaulting bidder in a foreclosure proceeding be disbursed to a bank, which made the winning bid, when the defaulting bidder chose to lower its
                        opening bid in a resale of the foreclosed property. In re Foreclosure of Real Prop. under Deed of Trust from Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 782 S.E.2d 922 (2016).

                        from either the clerk of the superior court or the court prior to making the disbursements permitted in subsection (a), and where the instrument giving rise to foreclosure grants no one the right to contest the disbursements, the

                        Surplus money arising upon a sale of land under a decree of foreclosure stands in place of the land itself in respect to liens thereon or vested rights therein. It is constructively, at least, real property, and belongs to the mortgagor or his assigns.

                        Obligation to Pay Costs and Expenses. - Payment of costs and expenses required by subsection (a) is not the obligation of a purchase money debtor whose deed of trust is being foreclosed; nor is it, strictly speaking, the obligation of the buyer at the
                        foreclosure sale. Instead, these statutory costs and expenses, including the trustee's commission, are simply obligations arising from the foreclosure sale which must be paid by the trustee before the remainder of the proceeds
                        may be distributed. Merritt v. Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 330</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 559 (1988); Whitley v. Griffin, 737 F. Supp. 345 (E.D.N.C. 1990).

                        which was similar in subject matter to this section, that the mortgagee should hold the proceeds of the sale after the satisfaction of his mortgage for the life tenant and remaindermen, who might determine whether the surplus should
                        be invested in accordance with their equities, or the interest of the life tenant be paid in cash under the provisions of G.S. 8-47, or the mortgagee might relieve himself of liability by paying the fund into court pursuant to
                        former G.S. 45-29. Brown v. Jennings, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 155</cite>, 124 S.E. 150 (1924).

                        (a) of this section to pay the foreclosure tax which is simply an obligation of the trustee that must be paid from the proceeds of the foreclosure sale, therefore the foreclosure sales were not instances in which the ultimate burden
                        of paying the tax fell upon the United States or its agencies and thus the tax was collectible. Whitley v. Griffin, 737 F. Supp. 345 (E.D.N.C. 1990).

                        The auctioneer's fee was formerly payable out of trustee's commissions. See Duffy v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 38</cite>, 43 S.E. 501 (1903).

                        Payment of Attorney's Fees. - Although subsection (a) does not have specific reference to attorneys' fees, to the extent the instrument provides for the payment of such fees, they become an "obligation secured by" the instrument, thus, any entitlement
                        to and the amount of attorneys' fees required for the conduct of the sale is also controlled by the instrument and subject to deduction from the sale proceeds. In re Deed of Trust, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite>                        458, 455 S.E.2d 676 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Court clerk auditing a final report of a foreclosure sale pursuant to G.S. 45-21.33 did not have the authority to make determinations about the reasonableness of attorney fees sought by a trustee under G.S. 45-21.31(a), as the proper remedy for a lienholder
                        was a separate proceeding against the trustee for breach of a fiduciary duty. In re Vogler Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 703 S.E.2d 159 (2010), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 389</cite>,

                        Clerk of the superior court exceeded his statutory authority in reducing the attorney's fees of a trustee because the clerk should have limited his audit to determining only whether the entries in the report reflected the actual receipts and disbursements
                        made by the trustee pursuant to G.S. 45-21.33; a trustee's attorney's fee provided for in the deed of trust is a cost and expense of the sale and therefore, must be paid by the trustee, G.S. 45-21.31(a)(1), and G.S. 45-21.33 does
                        not authorize the clerk to review the distribution of attorney's fees for reasonableness. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Vogler Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 389</cite>, 722 S.E.2d

        Constitutionality.
       </b> - For case holding the statutes providing procedure for real property mortgage foreclosure, sale, and eviction under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 are unconstitutional as applied, see Turner v.
                        Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Foreclosure and sale pursuant to the statutory scheme of this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975 was prospectively unlawful and void unless the power of sale was determined by the clerk to be a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of
                        due process rights under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, or the clerk determined that there had been adequate and timely notice to the mortgagor, coupled with opportunity for a hearing, before any rights were lost. Turner v. Blackburn,
                        389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clerk of the court is barred by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV from working a deprivation of the mortgagor's property without prior notice and an opportunity for a timely hearing, unless it is clear that those rights have been expressly waived. Turner v. Blackburn,
                        389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975), decided under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975.

                        <b>
        Minimum Requirements of Due Process.
       </b> - At a minimum, due process requires the trustee to make an initial showing before the clerk or similar neutral official that the mortgagor is in default under the obligation; the mortgagor must of course be afforded
                        the opportunity to rebut and defend the charges. Turner v. Blackburn, 389 F. Supp. 1250 (W.D.N.C. 1975), decided under this Article as it read prior to amendment in 1975.

                        The purpose of this section is to have in the files of the clerk proof that the foreclosure sale was properly conducted and that the notice was published. Britt v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 132, 215 S.E.2d
                        172, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 238</cite>, 217 S.E.2d 678 (1975).

                    <p>
                        Clerk's Authority in Conducting Audit. - In conducting the "audit" under this section the clerk is merely authorized to determine whether the entries in the report reflect the actual receipts and disbursements made by the trustee. In re Deed of Trust,
                        <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 458, 455 S.E.2d 676 (1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During the audit the clerk is not authorized to review the trustee-attorney's payment of attorney's fees to himself or herself for reasonableness, as this action would involve an improper exercise of judicial discretion, but instead, the clerk's audit
                        pursuant to G.S. 45-21.33(a) and (b) is a ministerial act that is limited to determining merely whether the entries in the report reflect the actual receipts and disbursements made by the trustee in the absence of a grant of original
                        jurisdiction to determine additional matters; as a result, the trustee is responsible for distributing the appropriate amount of attorney's fees in accordance with the provisions of the deed of trust. In re Foreclosure of the Deed
                        of Trust of Vogler Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 389</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 459 (2012).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clerk of the superior court exceeded his statutory authority in reducing the attorney's fees of a trustee because the clerk should have limited his audit to determining only whether the entries in the report reflected the actual receipts and disbursements
                        made by the trustee pursuant to G.S. 45-21.33; a trustee's attorney's fee provided for in the deed of trust is a cost and expense of the sale and therefore, must be paid by the trustee, G.S. 45-21.31(a)(1), and G.S. 45-21.33 does
                        not authorize the clerk to review the distribution of attorney's fees for reasonableness. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Vogler Realty, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 389</cite>, 722 S.E.2d

                        The fact that a properly signed publisher's affidavit was not filed within 30 days of the sale does not invalidate the sale. Britt v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 132, 215 S.E.2d 172, cert. denied and appeal

        Effect of Automatic Bankruptcy Stay on Redemption Period.
       </b> - Although the stay created by the filing of a bankruptcy petition is not the same as an injunction granted pursuant to this section, the filing of an upset bid in North Carolina is prohibited by the automatic stay

                        <span class="s2">
        §
       </span> 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Since the running of the period during which a debtor may redeem property in North Carolina is tied to the running of the upset bid period, the automatic stay prevents the running of the
                        redemption period as well. In other words, even though the automatic bankruptcy stay does not directly suspend the running of the state statutory redemption period, it indirectly has that effect by preventing the expiration of
                        the ten-day upset bid period. In re DiCello, 80 Bankr. 769 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1987).

                        Right of Bankrupt to Cure Default Held Terminated. - Although under this section a debtor may still seek to permanently enjoin a foreclosure after the sale has been held, and can raise defenses such as that the right to foreclose was waived or that there
                        was no default under the deed of trust, the foreclosure sale may nevertheless become final without any further action by the lender or the trustee on the deed of trust.

                        Bankruptcy court had the power to hear <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> debtors' claim that a deed they signed should be reformed because it encumbered a larger tract
                        of land than the debtors agreed to encumber - when they borrowed money from a home loan company. A clerk that reviewed a bank's foreclosure request under G.S. 45-21.16 did not make findings of fact concerning the accuracy of the
                        property's description, so the debtors' claim for reformation was not barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, the debtors' request was timely under G.S. 45-21.27, and G.S. 45-21.34 allowed courts to enjoin a sale upon the ground
                        that the amount bid or price offered was inadequate and inequitable and would result in irreparable damage to the owner. Hinson v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. (In re Hinson), 481 B.R. 364 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2012).

                    <p>
                        Proper Method for Invoking Equity Jurisdiction. - The proper method for invoking equitable jurisdiction to enjoin a foreclosure sale is by bringing an action in the superior court pursuant to this section. In re Watts, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite>                        90, 247 S.E.2d 427 (1978).

                    <p>
                        The hearing provided for in G.S. 45-21.16 was not intended to settle all matters in controversy between the parties, and the appropriate means for invoking equity jurisdiction is an action pursuant to this section. Golf Vistas, Inc. v. Mortgage Investors,
                        <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 249 S.E.2d 815 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the hearing under G.S. 45-21.16 is designed to provide a less timely and expensive procedure than foreclosure by action, it does not resolve all matters in controversy between mortgagor and mortgagee. If respondents feel that they have equitable
                        defenses to the foreclosure, they should be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under this section. In re Helms, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 284 S.E.2d 553 (1981), cert.
                        denied, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 300</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 149 (1982).

                    <p>
                        Mortgagors should not have been allowed to raise their equitable estoppel defense in a hearing brought pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16 as the trial court's consideration of the defense in that hearing was in excess of its authority. The proper method for asserting
                        the defense was by an action for injunction under this statute. In re Young, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 744 S.E.2d 476 (2013).

                        When mortgagors sued mortgagees for not accepting the mortgagors' late payments and foreclosing, the mortgagors' claims for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, tortious interference with contracts and business expectancy, and quantum meruit
                        were collaterally estopped because (1) the claims were contingent upon the mortgagors not having defaulted on the mortgages, and (2) prior foreclosure proceedings found the mortgagors' default, and those findings were not appealed,
                        fixing the parties' rights, before which the claims could have been raised. Funderburk v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 775 S.E.2d 1 (2015).

                        Defendants sought foreclosure through the power of sale, the statutory prerequisites were found and upheld on appeal, and foreclosure was ordered to proceed; although plaintiffs' declaratory judgment claims were an impermissible collateral attack, plaintiffs'
                        complaint was sufficient to invoke the trial court's equitable jurisdiction to argue the equitable grounds upon which the foreclosure sale should have been enjoined. Howse v. Bank of Am., N.A., <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite>                        22, 804 S.E.2d 552 (2017).

                        Mortgagor's claim of "fraud upon the court" failed because, inter alia, the mortgagor did not timely seek equitable relief after rights of the parties were fixed. Wilson v. SunTrust Bank, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite>                        237, 809 S.E.2d 286 (2017), cert. denied, 139 S. Ct. 2674, 204 L. Ed. 2d 1069, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 3810 (U.S. 2019).

                        How Equitable Defenses Raised. - Equitable defenses, such as the acceptance of late payments, may not be raised in a foreclosure hearing pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16, but must instead be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under this section.
                        In re Fortescue, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 330 S.E.2d 219, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 330</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 890 (1985).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The trial court erred in considering an equitable defense to foreclosure in a hearing held pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16, because the debtor has to pursue such a defense through an action to enjoin the foreclosure pursuant to this section. In re Trust of
                        Azalea Garden Bd. &amp; Care, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 535 S.E.2d 388 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err by ordering a foreclosure sale under G.S. 45-21.16 based on a finding that respondent was the holder of the note sought to be foreclosed and the note evidenced a valid debt petitioners owed; they failed to prove that two individuals
                        who advised them as to their rights and obligations under the mortgage at closing engaged in the unauthorized practice of law so as to render the debt invalid. If petitioners had equitable defenses to the foreclosure, they could
                        be asserted in an action to enjoin the foreclosure sale under G.S. 45-21.34. In re Gray, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 741 S.E.2d 888 (2013).

                        Application To Enjoin Foreclosure Sale Must Be Filed Before Upset Bid Period Expires. - Application to enjoin a foreclosure sale which remains undecided at the time that the parties' rights have become fixed is nothing more than a request that that which
                        has already been consummated be restrained; thus, absent sufficient action by a party seeking to avoid a foreclosure sale to prevent the sale from becoming final, any attempt to enjoin such a sale which has not been heard and decided
                        by the date for the submission of upset bids becomes moot and subject to dismissal at that time. Goad v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 704 S.E.2d 1 (2010).

                        Confirmation of Sale Under Power Is Not Required If No Upset Bid Is Filed. - Where a foreclosure sale is conducted in accordance with the provisions of Article 2A, G.S. 45-21.1 et seq., of this Chapter, and no upset bid is filed as provided in G.S. 45-21.27,
                        there is no legal requirement that the clerk either confirm the sale or direct the execution of a trustee's deed as a prerequisite to legal consummation of such sale by the trustee. Certain-Teed Prods. Corp. v. Sanders,

                        An executor could not restrain foreclosure of a deed of trust executed by his testator prior to his death upon the executor's petition for sale of the lands to make assets, when by the terms of the deed of trust the trustee was authorized to advertise
                        and sell the lands, the right of the trustee to sell the lands being contractual, and the sale by the trustee being subject to the provisions of this and the following sections. Miller v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 732</cite>,

                        Defense that the mortgagor was incompetent to execute the deed of trust was not available in a pre-foreclosure hearing pursuant to G.S. 45-21.16 before either the clerk or the superior court on appeal; however, such defense could be raised by bringing
                        an action to enjoin the foreclosure. In re Godwin, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 703, 468 S.E.2d 811 (1996).

                        injunction granted in the cause was properly continued to the hearing upon the court's finding that serious controversy existed between the parties and that plaintiff was entitled to a jury trial upon the issues of fact raised

                        Dismissal of Request to Enjoin Foreclosure Not Error. - Trial court did not err by dismissing as untimely and moot plaintiff's request to enjoin a foreclosure under G.S. 45-21.34 because given that no upset bid was filed by the expiration of the ten-day
                        period prescribed in G.S. 45-21.27 and that plaintiff did not obtain injunctive relief by the time that the upset bid period expired, the rights of the parties to the sale became fixed, rendering plaintiff's application moot; given
                        that the foreclosure sale became final before plaintiff obtained any sort of injunctive relief, plaintiff was left without the ability to prevent the consummation of the foreclosure on the property, since a court could not restrain

                        the issue determined by a jury, but the court may hear evidence and determine the issue, and should dismiss the action if it finds that the amount of the bid is the fair value of the land or enjoin the consummation of the sale
                        if it finds that the bid is grossly inadequate. Smith v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 213</cite>, 183 S.E. 276 (1936).

                        Application To Enjoin Foreclosure Sale Must Be Filed Before Upset Bid Period Expires. - Application seeking to enjoin a foreclosure sale must be heard and decided, as well as filed, prior to the date upon which the rights of the parties to the sale became
                        fixed in order for the superior court to retain the authority to enjoin a foreclosure sale; given that temporary restraining orders may be issued on a ex parte basis in appropriate instances, and given that "apply" can be defined
                        as to make a formal request or motion, an interpretation of G.S. 45-21.34 that requires the applicant to seek and obtain the requested injunction before the point at which the upset bid period expires is completely consistent with
                        the literal language and the underlying purpose sought to be achieved through the relevant statutory provision. Goad v. Chase Home Fin., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 704 S.E.2d 1

                        by virtue of a consent order; plaintiffs' complaint sought an injunction pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, the trial court issued a temporary restraining order in accordance with that statute, and the consent order subsequently disposed

                        Trial Court Properly Refused To Consider Rescission Defense. - Trial court did not err in refusing to consider mortgagors' defense that the debt a substitute trustee sought to foreclose was not a valid debt because the trial court properly concluded that
                        the mortgagors' argument that they had rescinded the loan transaction, invaliding the debt the trustee sought to foreclose, was an equitable defense and not properly before the trial court. In re Foreclosure by David A. Simpson,

                        Arbitration Issue. - Trial court properly refused to rule on the owners' motion to compel arbitration in a foreclosure action because, as the substitute trustee initiated the foreclosure under a power of sale, both the clerk's and the trial court's scope
                        of review was limited to issues related to the six findings specified in G.S. 45-21.16; the owners' argument concerning their right to arbitration was not pertinent to the six required findings. The owners should have raised their
                        right to arbitrate in a motion to enjoin pursuant to G.S. 45-21.34, which granted the trial court statutory authority and jurisdiction to issue a stay and enforce the arbitration agreement contained in the deed of trust. In re

                        the record that the owner paid a bond to stay the foreclosure sale, under G.S. 1-292; nor was there an upset bid during the 10 day period pursuant to G.S. 45-21.29A, or any indication in the record that the owner obtained a temporary
                        restraining order or preliminary injunction prior to the end of the ten-day upset bid period. In re Foreclosure of the Deed of Trust of Hackley, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 713 S.E.2d

                        jurisdiction to authorize the sale; thus; the foreclosure sale was consummated, and the parties' rights in the real property were fixed, in accordance with G.S. 45-21.29A. In re Foreclosure of the Nine Deeds of Trust of Marshall

                        Legislative Intent. - The General Assembly's intention to limit the protection of the statute to those who hold a property interest in the mortgaged property is clear.

                        in Article 2A and on neither occasion did the General Assembly make changes indicating an intention to include leasehold interests within the coverage of Article 2B. The General Assembly's silence on this subject is convincing
                        proof that defendants, as lessees, lacked standing to assert the defense in this section. Fleet Nat'l Bank v. Raleigh Oaks Joint Venture, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 387, 451 S.E.2d 325 (1994).

                        Public Policy. - While the statute is an equitable method of debt calculation as opposed to a traditional defense that is subject to waiver, because anti-deficiency legislation is so narrowly tailored to address specific instances of the public's vulnerability
                        to lender overreach, waiver of this statutory protection as a prerequisite to receipt of a mortgage or as a condition of a guaranty agreement would violate public policy. High Point Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Highmark Props., LLC,

                        Section Applies to Mortgagee Who Holds Obligation Securing Property for Sale. - This section does not say that it applies to any mortgagee or to a mortgagee who holds an obligation secured by the property for sale. Rather, it applies to the mortgagee,
                        payee or other holder, who holds the obligation thereby secured, i.e., the obligation secured by the property for sale, and under which the sale is held. Northwestern Bank v.

                        sale price, it was held that the note was properly credited with the sale price and not the amount realized by the payee upon the judgment, and that since the bidding at the sale was open to all and the sale was under order of
                        court, the endorser on the note could not assert this section as a defense to his liability, the statute, by the express language of its proviso, not being applicable. Briggs v. Lassiter, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 761</cite>,

                        Defense Not Available to Guarantors. - Even though one defendant owned 77% of the capital stock of the corporation, and pledged his own assets and extended his own personal credit in order to pay off creditors, defendant guarantors did not possess a property
                        interest in the mortgaged property since title to that property was held solely in the name of the corporation; defendants, therefore, could not assert the defense contained in this section. Borg-Warner Acceptance Corp. v. Johnston,

                        defendants; although the guarantor received an interest in the property, the guarantor did not assume any of the borrower's obligations to the bank under the promissory note. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Arlington Hills of Mint Hill,

                        Applicability to Guarantors' Liability. - When a bank sought a deficiency judgment, following foreclosure, against a borrower and guarantors, a trial court did not improperly reduce the guarantors' liability pursuant to G.S. 45-21.36 by allowing the guarantors
                        to re-join the borrower after the bank dismissed the borrower, when a jury found the fair market value of the foreclosed property was more than the bank paid for the property at foreclosure, because the guarantors were only liable
                        for the debt of the borrower, which could legitimately claim an offset pursuant to the jury's fair market value determination. High Point Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

                    <p>
                        Trial court erred in granting a bank summary judgment in its action against a guarantor to collect the deficiency remaining on a loan debt because the guarantor was entitled to the statute's defense/offset even though the borrower had been dismissed from
                        the action; the guaranty agreement made no mention of a waiver of the guarantor's potential defense/offset. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 293, 769 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Just as a guarantor may raise this defense, he similarly is entitled to its benefits should it be determined that the property's fair market value exceeded the purchase price paid by the creditor at the trustee's foreclosure sale; a guarantor is protected
                        by the provision of the statute that provides for a judicial method of determining the indebtedness, and as the guarantors only guaranteed the repayment of the indebtedness, the amount of the indebtedness was calculated pursuant
                        to the statute, and it was not the type of defense or offset that was subject to waiver. High Point Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Highmark Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 301</cite>, 776 S.E.2d 838

                    <p>
                        Statute simply allows guarantors the right to a judicial method of debt calculation that accounts for the fair market value of the property at the time of a foreclosure sale; accordingly, notwithstanding the waiver language contained in the guaranty agreements,
                        guarantors did not waive their right to the protection of the statute. High Point Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Highmark Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 301</cite>, 776 S.E.2d 838 (2015).

                        Protection of Partners. - Each partner, though certainly not enjoying the traditional rights of owners, holds a property interest sufficient to invoke the protection of this section. If it were otherwise, mortgagees could avoid the requirements of this
                        section when foreclosing on property owned by a partnership simply by suing the partners for a deficiency. NCNB Nat'l Bank v. O'Neill, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 313, 401 S.E.2d 858 (1991).

                        This section does not entitle debtor to have credited upon the note whatever profit purchaser may realize upon subsequent sale of the property. There is no principle of law, apart from this section, which entitles the debtor to such credit simply by reason

                        But a sale subsequent to the foreclosure sale would be a circumstance indicating the fair value of the property at the time of the foreclosure, the weight to be given it depending upon other circumstances, such as the lapse of time between the foreclosure
                        and the subsequent sale and the known probability, at the time of the foreclosure sale, that such subsequent sale could be made. Wachovia Realty Invs. v. Housing, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 93</cite>,

                        "Substantially Less" - Although mortgagors argued a mortgagee violated G.S. 45-21.36 by bidding "substantially less" than the property was worth, the nine percent difference between the appraised value of the property and the mortgagee's bid may have
                        been "less" than true value but was not "substantially less" than true value; the mortgagee bid $100,000 for the property, the appraised value was $109,000, and the property ultimately sold for $110,000. Blue Ridge Sav. Bank, Inc.

                        Bank's proof of claim to recover a deficiency was not barred or reduced because, although the debtors' expert appraiser disagreed, the bank's expert appraisers testified that the bank's bid at a foreclosure sale of the debtors' property was not substantially

                    <p>
                        Summary Judgment Inappropriate. - In a deficiency action, summary judgment was inappropriately granted to a bank because an affidavit produced by two debtors constituted substantial evidence that their property was worth the amount of the debt that was
                        owed at the time of the foreclosure. Even though a bank's appraiser valued the property at the bank's foreclosure bid (far below the debt amount) and the bank ultimately sold the property for far less than its bid, the debtors
                        put forth evidence regarding the value of the property which was at odds with the bank's evidence. United Cmty. Bank (Ga.) v. Wolfe, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 775 S.E.2d 677 (2015).

                        Sufficient evidence supported the trial court's finding, under this section, that the foreclosed property was worth far more than the plaintiff bid for it and that the defendant was, therefore, not indebted to plaintiff in any amount. First Citizens Bank

                        Where defendants, makers of note, were held to have no property interest in mortgaged property, upon default they were not entitled under this section to show that the property was worth the amount of the debt secured by it or that the amount bid was
                        substantially less than its true value. Raleigh Fed. Sav. Bank v. Godwin, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 761, 394 S.E.2d 294 (1990).

                        Appeal. - Guarantor did not waive his right to argue the G.S. 45-21.36 defense/ooffset because his counsel raised the statute as a defense during argument at the summary judgment hearing; the guarantor also raised the defense in his pleading, which was
                        before the trial court, and the trial court considered that ground in its questioning of counsel. Branch Banking &amp; Trust Co. v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 293, 769 S.E.2d 638,

                        were an impermissible collateral attack, plaintiffs' complaint was sufficient to invoke the trial court's equitable jurisdiction to argue the equitable grounds upon which the foreclosure sale should have been enjoined. Howse v.

                            The purpose of the anti-deficiency statute is to prevent oppression of a purchase money debtor by a purchase money creditor. The purchase money debtor has both an equitable and statutory right to redeem. Colson &amp; Colson Constr. Co. v. Maultsby,

                            Legislative Intent. - The unique features of this section manifest the legislative intent that the statute as originally enacted should apply only to purchase-money mortgages and deeds of trust given by the vendee to the vendor, and that its application
                            to third parties be limited to assignees of the seller. Childers v. Parker's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 256</cite>, 162 S.E.2d 481 (1968).

                        <p>
                            This section was obviously designed to protect a vendor's assignee, who would not know the nature of the transaction. Childers v. Parker's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 256</cite>, 162 S.E.2d 481 (1968).

                            The manifest intention of the legislature in this section was to limit the creditor to the property conveyed when the note and mortgage or deed of trust are executed to the seller of the real estate and the securing instruments state that they are for
                            the purpose of securing the balance of the purchase price. Ross Realty Co. v. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 366</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 271 (1979); Reavis v. Ecological

                            The legislature intended to take away from creditors the option of suing upon the note in a purchase-money mortgage transaction. Ross Realty Co. v. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 366</cite>,

                            This section seeks to protect the purchaser of real property in those instances where the seller also financed the sale. In re Gulledge, 17 Bankr. 311 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1982).

                        <p>
                            At foreclosure, the holder of a purchase money mortgage or deed of trust is limited to the recovery of the security or to the proceeds from the sale of the security. The holder is prohibited from ignoring his security and bringing an in personam action
                            against the mortgagor on the note secured by the deed of trust. The holder is, also, prohibited from bringing an in personam suit after foreclosure to recover a deficiency. In fact, the State's Supreme Court has stated, unequivocally,
                            that the manifest intention of the Legislature in codifying this section was to limit the creditor to the property conveyed when the note and mortgage or deed of trust are executed to the seller of the real estate. Blanton

                        <p>
                            The legislative intent behind this section is to limit recovery by purchase money mortgagees to the property conveyed. Underlying this intent is a desire to discourage oppressive overpricing at sale and underpricing at foreclosure. Sink v. Egerton,
                            <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 333 S.E.2d 520 (1985).

                            A deficiency judgment is an imposition of personal liability on a mortgagor for the unpaid balance of the mortgage debt after foreclosure has failed to yield the full amount of debt due.

         Effect of Section.
        </b> - This section limits the seller who finances the purchase of real property to those funds which he obtains from a foreclosure upon the property. In re Gulledge, 17 Bankr. 311 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1982).

                        <p>
                            This section bars an action against the guarantors of a purchase money note to recover the debt for the balance of the purchase price represented by the note. Adams v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 242</cite>, 456
                            S.E.2d 514 (1995).

                            The 1961 amendment did not change the original meaning of this section; it merely made specific that which had theretofore been implicit. Childers v. Parker's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 256</cite>, 162 S.E.2d 481
                            (1968).

                        <p>
                            The benefits of this section cannot be waived; it effects the broad public purpose of abolishing deficiency judgments in purchase money transactions if foreclosure on the security yields an insufficient fund to satisfy the indebtedness secured, and the
                            protection it offers is afforded to all purchasers of realty who secure any part of the purchase price with a deed of trust on the realty they are purchasing. Chemical Bank v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite>                            356, 255 S.E.2d 421, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 293</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 911 (1979).

                            The protection of the anti-deficiency judgment statute was designed for the benefit of the general public and was not intended to be merely a right which could be waived, or which purchasers could be compelled to waive as a prerequisite for obtaining
                            financing. Chemical Bank v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 255 S.E.2d 421, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 293</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 911 (1979).

                            Doctrine of estoppel will not deprive a defendant of his right to assert this section in his defense to a deficiency proceeding; were a purchaser able, either by his action or by contract, to deny to himself the protection afforded him by the legislature,
                            it would be to allow by indirection that which was directly forbidden. Chemical Bank v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 255 S.E.2d 421, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 293</cite>,

                            Purchase Money Debtor Cannot Be Forced to Elect. - Except for ad valorem taxes, property assessments and property insurance premiums paid by the purchase money creditor on behalf of the purchase money debtor, a purchase money debtor cannot be forced to
                            elect between paying an amount in excess of the balance purchase price secured by a purchase money deed of trust or forfeiting the property at foreclosure. Colson &amp; Colson Constr. Co. v. Maultsby,
                            <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 405 S.E.2d 779 (1991).

                            Right of Redemption Cannot Be Conditioned on Payment of Additional Moneys. - A purchase money debtor's exercise of his right of redemption cannot be conditioned on the payment of additional moneys not secured by the purchase money deed of trust. To hold
                            otherwise would be to make the purchase money debtor personally liable, a consequence the anti-deficiency statute prohibits. Colson &amp; Colson Constr. Co. v. Maultsby, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite>                            424, 405 S.E.2d 779 (1991).

                            Applicability to Mortgages, etc., Executed in Another State on Foreign Realty. - This section operates to deprive our courts of jurisdiction to enter the deficiency judgments proscribed, and the section applies to all such deficiency judgments, including
                            those predicated upon notes secured by mortgages or deeds of trust executed in another state upon realty lying therein. Bullington v. Angel, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 18</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 411

                            A defendant's guaranty of the obligations of a corporation under a lease/purchase agreement will not remove him from the protection of the anti-deficiency statute and make him liable for the entire face amount of the note, where the option to purchase
                            was assigned to defendant personally, and defendant exercised it by taking title to the property in himself and personally signing the note and deed of trust; all of the obligations and promises merged in defendant who became
                            an ordinary purchaser of realty who financed his acquisition of the property by a purchase money note and deed of trust. Chemical Bank v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 255

                            he has been compelled to pay or judgment has been rendered fixing his liability. Childers v. Parker's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 237</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 323 (1963).

                            Noteholder Could Recover Debt Only from Property Conveyed. - The holder of a promissory note given by a buyer to a seller for the purchase of land and secured by a deed of trust embracing the land could not release his security and sue on the note, but
                            had to look exclusively to the property conveyed in seeking to recover any balance owed. Barnaby v. Boardman, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 565</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 600 (1985).

                            When the purchase money debtor defaults, the purchase money creditor is limited strictly to the property conveyed in all cases in which the note and mortgage or deed of trust are executed to the seller of the real estate and the securing instruments state
                            that they are for the purpose of securing the balance of the purchase price. Merritt v. Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 330</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 559 (1988).

                            Fees of Attorneys of Purchase Money Creditor Not Secured. - Where a promissory note states on its face that it is "given as purchase money, and is secured by a purchase money deed of trust," and the note is incorporated by reference into the deed of trust,
                            attorneys' fees are not part of the purchase price. Hence, even if the trustee were to foreclose on the purchase money deed of trust, the purchase money creditor's attorneys' fees would not be a secured obligation. Colson &amp;

                            the costs of foreclosure of the deed of trust and sale of the property and related attorneys' fees. Merritt v. Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 330</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 559 (1988), distinguishing

                            Effect of G.S. 6-21.2. - Section 6-21.2 deals in general and comprehensive terms with the propriety of attorneys' fees arising from the collection of indebtedness and, therefore, was not controlling in a case in which a seller of real property had accepted
                            a purchase money deed of trust from his buyer and then sought recovery upon default; this section deals with just such a particular situation. Merritt v. Ridge, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 330</cite>,

                            Duty to Mitigate Damages. - Plaintiffs were required to take only reasonable efforts to mitigate their damages; they were not required to attempt enforcement of either the note or the guaranty when a reasonable person would have concluded such efforts
                            would be futile. Smith v. Childs, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 437 S.E.2d 500 (1993).

                            Purchase Money Creditor Limited to Recovery of Property. - A purchase money deed of trust creditor cannot bring an action on the note to recover the purchase price either before or after foreclosure and is strictly limited to the property which was conveyed
                            for purposes of securing the balance of the purchase price. Colson &amp; Colson Constr. Co. v. Maultsby, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 424, 405 S.E.2d 779 (1991).

                            upon foreclosure of the properties. In re Gulledge, 17 Bankr. 311 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1982).

                            So long as the debt of the purchaser of property is secured by a deed of trust on the property or part of it given by the purchaser to secure payment of the purchase price, the deed of trust is a purchase money deed of trust. Burnette Indus., Inc. v.

                            defendants had neither instituted foreclosure proceedings against them nor commenced any action to enforce an adjustable rate balloon note. Poole v.

                            was deleted from the promissory note and deed of trust, as these amendments were done by their attorney, and were not supervised by the seller. Brumley v.

                            The fact that the land sale transaction occurred as part of an agreement settling a dispute between the parties did not prevent its categorization as a purchase money transaction since the existence of additional promises not directly arising out of the

                            Where property to be sold at foreclosure under a supplemental deed of trust was not the property conveyed for which a purchase money note and purchase money deed of trust were given, yet the debt to be satisfied was that reflected by the purchase money
                            note, the provisions of supplemental deed of trust purporting to provide additional security for the purchase money note were unenforceable under this section. Goforth Properties, Inc. v. Birdsall,

                            Because G.S. 45-21.38 specified that the foreclosing party was not entitled to a deficiency judgment if the underlying transaction was a purchase money transaction, the former owner drafted the contract, the purchase money promissory note, and the purchase
                            money deed of trust, and the contract specifically provided that the purchase money promissory note was secured by a "purchase money deed of trust which shall be first lien on the Property," thus, both parties had sufficient
                            notice that the contract was to be construed as a purchase money transaction, and the buyer should have been allowed to amend as the benefits of G.S. 45-21.38 could not be waived and the trial court improperly granted partial

                            deed of trust only if it is made as a part of the same transaction in which the debtor purchases land, embraces the land so purchased, and secures all or part of its purchase price. Dobias v. White,

                            Even if the promissory note and deed of trust contained language indicating that they were purchase money instruments, this section was not applicable to limit petitioners to foreclose on land actually sold by them to respondents; petitioners sought to
                            foreclose on property conveyed under a deed of trust, and this section only prohibits a mortgagee or trustee in a purchase money situation from obtaining a deficiency judgment. In re Fuller,

                        attorney fees to the home buyers for the investor's failure to cancel a deed in that the successor judge was without authority to make the awards. Cail v.

                        Construction. - Court of Appeals of North Carolina is constrained to hold that an instrument erroneously satisfied of record under G.S. 45-36.6(b) is one for which the certificate of satisfaction was erroneously or mistakenly filed for any reason, even
                        a unilateral mistake having nothing to do with whether the underlying obligation actually was fully paid off. Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Am. Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite>                        280, 791 S.E.2d 906 (2016).

        Applicability.
       </b> - G.S. 45-36.7(g) was not applicable to a matter in which a trial court granted summary judgment in favor of a bank on its conversion claim against a real estate firm because the firm contended that the bank's instruction
                        in a payoff statement that no funds be disbursed to the seller constituted an improper qualification of the payoff amount under G.S. 45-36.7(g), but it did not cite to any North Carolina case authority in support of its argument,
                        and there was no reason for construing the bank's proscription on disbursements of funds to the seller as a qualification of the payoff amount. Trey Inman &amp; Assocs., P.C. v. Bank of Am., N.A., 306 Ga. App. 451, 702 S.E.2d 711

                        of a notice from the person who originally gave the credit suspension directive that the credit suspension directive is withdrawn, the secured creditor may reinstate the borrower's right and ability to obtain credit advances.

                </p>
                <p>
                    You have a loan with (name of lender) secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on real property located at (address of property).
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will be responsible for disbursing funds in connection with a scheduled sale of the property or a new loan that will be secured by the property. A requirement of the sale or new loan transaction is that the property be conveyed or encumbered free and
                    clear of the existing mortgage or deed of trust that secures your loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As permitted by North Carolina law, we are sending the (enclosed/attached/following/foregoing) notification to your lender directing that it temporarily suspend your right and ability to obtain credit advances in anticipation of the settlement of the
                    sale or loan. The notification accompanies a request asking the amount that must be sent to your lender to pay your loan in full and cancel the mortgage or deed of trust that secures your loan (or, if your loan will not be paid in
                    full, to release the property from the mortgage or deed of trust that secures your loan). The information your lender provides us may be inaccurate if you obtain additional credit advances before the scheduled settlement date of the
                    sale or new loan transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your lender receives our directive, it will temporarily suspend your right and ability to obtain credit advances. The period of suspension will continue through and including (anticipated payoff date), the anticipated payoff date, regardless of whether
                    the settlement of the sale or new loan transaction occurs as scheduled. The suspension will not affect your responsibility to continue making payments to your lender during the suspension period. You should not attempt to obtain additional
                    credit advances from your lender during the suspension period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may instruct us at any time during the suspension period to withdraw the credit suspension directive we are sending your lender, and we are required by law to comply. However, if you do so, you may jeopardize the settlement of the sale or new loan
                    transaction because the payoff or release information provided by your lender may become inaccurate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When proceeds from a sale or new loan transaction are used to pay an existing loan in full, lenders typically close the loan account, thereby terminating their borrower's ability to obtain additional credit advances. You should contact your lender to
                    determine whether you will be able to obtain additional credit advances after the settlement of the sale or new loan transaction.
                </p>

                    instrument is recorded in Book ______________ at Page ______________ or as document number _________________________________ in the Office of the Register of Deeds for ______________ County, North Carolina. 3. I have reasonable grounds

                    property described in the security instrument, I gave notification to the secured creditor in the manner prescribed by G.S. 45-36.14 of my intention to sign and record an affidavit of satisfaction of the security instrument if, within

                    has elapsed. I have no knowledge that the secured creditor has submitted a satisfaction for recording, and I have not received notification that the secured obligation remains unsatisfied. [ ] I have been authorized by the secured
                    creditor to execute and record this Affidavit of Satisfaction. [ ] I have in my possession the original security instrument and the original bond, note, or other instrument secured thereby, with an endorsement of payment and satisfaction
                    appearing thereon made by one or more of the following: (i) the secured creditor; (ii) the trustee or substitute trustee, if the security instrument is a deed of trust; (iii) an assignee of the secured creditor; or (iv) a bank, savings

                    thereof. [ ] I have in my possession the original security instrument together with the original bond, note, or other instrument secured thereby, or the original security instrument alone if the security instrument itself sets forth
                    the obligation secured or other obligation to be performed and does not call for or recite any note, bond, or other instrument secured by it. All such instruments are more than 10 years old counting from the maturity date of the last
                    obligation secured. If the instrument or instruments secured by the security instrument have an endorsement of partial payment, satisfaction, or performance or discharge within the period of 10 years, the period of 10 years has been

                        Methods To Extend a Lien. - The lien of a recorded security instrument may be extended one or more times by recording (i) a lien maturity extension agreement or (ii) a notice of maturity date. If more than one lien maturity extension agreement or notice
                        of maturity date is recorded, the most recently recorded lien maturity extension agreement or notice of maturity date controls in determining when the lien of a security instrument expires. A lien maturity extension agreement or

                        recorded in the office of the register of deeds without the written agreement of the then owner of the property encumbered by the lien of the security instrument.

        Creditor's Lien Attached to Proceeds.
       </b> - Although a creditor might be barred under North Carolina law from seeking collection under the terms of a promissory note, which was a sealed instrument, for debtor to defeat the creditor's claim of a secured interest
                        in the proceeds of the property, he had to attack the related deed of trust (DOT) and the lien it secured on the property. Creditor's lien attached to the proceeds of a sale of the property, as the lien created by the DOT would

                        Purpose. - The primary purpose sought to be accomplished by subdivision (5) of this section as it stood prior to the 1969 amendment (see now subsection (b)) was to promote freer marketability in cases where old and unsatisfied mortgages and deeds of trust,
                        securing debts, were hampering real estate transactions; and this economic purpose is adequately accomplished by furnishing protection to parties who extend credit or purchase for a valuable consideration "from and after" the expiration
                        of the 15-year period. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 172</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 51 (1947).

                        of titles. Smith v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 172</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 51 (1947).

                        Construction of Section. - This section will be construed to effectuate the legislative intent as gathered from its language, by harmonizing its various parts when this can reasonably be done. Richmond Guano Co. v. Walston,

                        Applicability to Deeds of Trust and Mortgages. - This section, giving to the marginal entry of satisfaction the effect of a reconveyance, applies only to discharge of trust deeds and mortgages. Smith v. King, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 273</cite>,
                        12 S.E. 57 (1890).

                        Presumption of Expiration. - Trust's lien on real property remained valid, enforceable, and superior to another creditor's lien because the trust's interest was recorded first and the other creditor acquired its interest before the statutory presumption
                        in G.S. 45-37(b)(1)(2) concerning the expiration of the trust's lien took effect. Falk v. Mae, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 685, 738 S.E.2d 404 (2013), rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 594</cite>,

                        Modes of Release. - A mortgage can only be released so as to affect purchasers at a sale under the mortgage by a cancellation on the margin of the registration thereof under this section, or by a reconveyance of the mortgaged property duly recorded. Barber
                        v. Wadsworth, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 29</cite>, 20 S.E. 178 (1894).

                    <p>
                        The mortgagee acknowledges the satisfaction and discharge of the mortgage in the presence of the register of deeds, and he enters satisfaction on the margin of the record of the mortgage, and this entry is signed by the mortgagee; and this, done as required
                        by this section, will operate as a deed of release, or reconveyance of the land embraced by the mortgagee. Otherwise, the mortgagee must reconvey the land by proper deed. Walker v. Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 259</cite>                        (1884).

                    <p>
                        Form and Validity of Cancellation. - This section must be strictly complied with in order to secure the grantee in a subsequent conveyance of the locus in quo against the prior encumbrance, and where this is done, upon exhibit of the cancelled conveyance
                        and notes marked paid, the entry should recite correctly the name of the beneficiary and payment of the note, notes or bonds, as the case may be, by the payee thereof. Mills v. Kemp, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 309</cite>,
                        145 S.E. 557 (1928).

                    <p>
                        Trustee's objection to the secured status asserted in a proof of claim was allowed, as the cancellation of a deed of trust not only eradicated perfection but also constituted satisfaction of the underlying debt and reconveyance of any rights that a bank
                        had in property to debtor under North Carolina law. The statute of limitations did not bar trustee's assertion of his strong-arm powers defensively, as a basis for objecting to the bank's secured proof of claim; further, the bank's
                        claim had to be disallowed if the claim would be avoidable, as opposed to avoided. In re McCowan, - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Aug. 24, 2018).

                    <p>
                        Marginal Entry as Evidence of Payment of Debt. - It is competent to introduce as evidence of payment of an indebtedness secured by mortgage the entry of "satisfied" on the margin of the record signed by the mortgagee and witnessed by the register of deeds.
                        Robinson v. Sampson, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 99</cite>, 28 S.E. 189 (1897).

                    <p>
                        Marginal Entry Not Necessary as Between Parties. - When a mortgage debt has been discharged, the mortgage is no longer operative between the parties, even though it is not marked "satisfied of record." Blake v. Broughton,
                        <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 220</cite>, 12 S.E. 127 (1890).

                    <p>
                        Irregular Cancellation as Notice to Subsequent Grantee or Mortgagee. - Where an entry of cancellation was made of record by the register of deeds in cancelling a mortgage under this section, reciting another name as mortgagee, trustee or cestui que trust
                        than that appearing in the registration of the instrument, and stating that the "bond" was marked paid, when the instrument recited four bonds maturing in series, it was sufficient to set a later grantee or mortgagee upon inquiry
                        as to whether the register of deeds had made a mistake in cancelling the mortgage, and fix him with notice of all facts which a reasonable inquiry would have revealed. Mills v. Kemp, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 309</cite>,
                        145 S.E. 557 (1928).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Forged Cancellation. - When the attorney for the owner of the land agreed to have a mortgage cancelled of record, and thereafter surreptitiously obtained the cancellation stamp of the register of deeds and forged his signature so that it appeared
                        that the mortgage was cancelled under the provisions of subdivision (2) of this section as it stood prior to the 1969 amendment, and relying thereon the proposed purchaser accepted the deed and paid the consideration, it was held
                        that the supposed cancellation of the mortgage was void as against the mortgagee, who had no notice thereof until immediately before bringing his action to have the supposed cancellation declared void. Union Cent. Life Ins. Co.
                        v. Cates, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 456</cite>, 137 S.E. 324 (1927).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As against the mortgagee of a third mortgage given on the same lands, wrongful cancellation by a forged entry on the margin in the registration book is a nullity, and the lien continues until the payment of the debt it secures, as prior to that of the
                        third mortgage, when the second mortgage lien has lawfully been cancelled of record. Swindell v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 474</cite>, 137 S.E. 420 (1927).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Effect of Prior Fraud on Subsequent Mortgagees. - Where the register of deeds has entered "satisfaction" of a deed of trust, and thereupon subsequent mortgagees, etc., have acted in good faith, the prior fraud or collusion of the parties to the cancelled
                        instrument will not affect the rights of the subsequent mortgagees, when such mortgagees were unaware of or had not participated in the fraud. Richmond Guano Co. v. Walston, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 667</cite>,
                        122 S.E. 663 (1924).

                    <p>
                        Who May Cancel. - Only the mortgagee or his duly authorized agent or representative was entitled to have mortgage cancelled on the book in the office of the register of deeds under subdivision (1) of this section as it stood prior to the 1969 amendment;
                        and when the mortgagee canceled the instrument in person, under subdivision (1), it was a complete release and discharge of the mortgage, for in such case the statute did not require the exhibition of the mortgage and the note
                        it secured. First Nat'l Bank v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 165</cite>, 110 S.E. 865 (1922).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where a note secured by a mortgage was assigned and pledged as collateral by the mortgagee to his own note, without an assignment of the mortgage conveying title for the purpose of the security, but only with the surrender of the instrument to the payee
                        of his note, the legal title to the lands remained in the mortgagee, who alone was authorized to cancel the mortgage. First Nat'l Bank v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 165</cite>, 110 S.E. 865 (1922).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under subdivision (2) of this section as it stood prior to the 1969 amendment, no authority was given to the register of deeds to enter cancellation of record upon the cancellation thereof by the mortgagor. Faircloth v. Johnson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 429</cite>, 127 S.E. 346 (1925).

                    <p>
                        Payee or Mortgagee To Be Sui Juris. - In order to constitute a valid cancellation under subdivision (2) of this section as it stood prior to the 1969 amendment, this section contemplated a payee or mortgagee who was sui juris. Faircloth v. Johnson,
                        <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 429</cite>, 127 S.E. 346 (1925).

                    <p>
                        Cancellation by Attorney and Ratification Thereof. - While an attorney at law has no power to cancel or discharge a deed of mortgage without authority conferred by his client, nevertheless, where such attorney informed his client that he was unable to
                        complete an arrangement agreed upon with the debtor for obtaining a new mortgage and the sale of a stock of goods upon which the creditor had a lien, unless a cancellation of an old mortgage was made, and that he would cancel the
                        old mortgage by a day named, unless directed not to do so, and the attorney, receiving no such direction, cancelled the old mortgage, and forwarded to his client the new mortgage and power of sale, and the new mortgage was returned
                        without objection to be registered, this was held to be a ratification by the client of the act of cancellation of the old mortgage. Christian v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 72</cite>, 32
                        S.E. 383 (1899).

                    <p>
                        Authority of Trustee to Cancel. - Possession of the papers by the trustee raises a presumption of his authority to cancel deed of trust of record. Williams v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 806</cite>, 18 S.E.2d 364 (1942).
                    </p>

                        This section only empowers the trustee to "acknowledge satisfaction of the provisions of such trust, etc.," the entry operating as a reconveyance. It was never contemplated that the trustee could by this means release from an unsatisfied trust specified
                        parts of the land. However, the creditor could be estopped, under certain circumstances, from enforcing his claim against that part of the land undertaken to be released by the trustee if the release was done with the creditor's
                        consent and authority was properly shown. Woodcock v. Merrimon, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 731</cite>, 30 S.E. 321 (1898). See also, Browne v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 23</cite>, 13 S.E.

                        Even if an attempted release is under seal it is ineffectual, as the statute authorizing such mode of release confers no power upon a trustee to release specific parts of the property conveyed, and especially where the secured debt remains unsatisfied.

                        Cancellation by First Mortgagee. - The legal title to mortgaged lands is conveyed by the instrument to the mortgagee, and remains in him until it is transferred or assigned, for the purpose of the security or the cancellation of the instrument, under
                        this section; and where the mortgagor has afterwards conveyed the fee simple title to another, and receives a mortgage back to secure a note for the balance of the purchase price, of which the same mortgagee becomes the holder,
                        his personal cancellation of the first mortgage, without producing it or the note it secures, is a complete discharge or release of the lien thereof; and where he borrows money after such cancellation, and hypothecates the note
                        of the second mortgage as collateral to his own, the lender for the purposes of the security, acting in good faith, has a prior lien on the lands. First Nat'l Bank v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 165</cite>,

                        Removal of Deed of Trust as Cloud on Title. - Where a deed of trust was executed subsequent to the effective date of subdivision (5) of this section as it stood prior to the 1969 amendment (see now subsection (b), and the note thereby secured fell due
                        more than 15 years prior to plaintiffs' purchase of the property, and no affidavit was filed nor was any marginal entry made on the record by the register of deeds as required by the statute, plaintiffs were entitled to have the
                        deed of trust removed insofar as it constituted a cloud on their title. Thomas v. Myers, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 234</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 478 (1948), decided prior to the 1951 amendment.

                        Registration of Collateral Instrument Not Notice to Purchaser. - A purchaser is presumed to have examined each recorded deed or instrument in his line of title and to know its contents. He is not required to take notice of and examine recorded collateral
                        instruments and documents which are not muniments of his title and are not referred to by the instruments in his chain of title. Vitiating facts must appear in deraigning title, on the face of deeds in the chain of title, and in
                        one of the muniments of title. Morehead v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 235, 166 S.E.2d 476 (1969).

                        Expiration of Lien. - North Carolina life of lien statute allowed creditors or purchasers for value from a grantor to benefit from the conclusive presumption that prior liens expired after fifteen years irrespective of when those creditors obtained their
                        interest. Accordingly, the statute acted to terminate a trust deed and permitted the Federal National Mortgage Association in 2011 to foreclose on the property unencumbered. Falk v. Fannie Mae, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 594</cite>,

                    by the original payee and beneficiary in said deed of trust, or other security instrument, or by his assignee of record, or by his or their properly constituted officer, agent, attorney, or legal representatives, and has been duly
                    witnessed by the register of deeds or his deputy, all such entries of cancellation and satisfaction are hereby validated and made full, sufficient and complete to release, satisfy and discharge the lien of such instrument, and shall

        Reference in Promissory Note to Security Agreement.

                        is that the obligation be covered by the security agreement. In re Mills, 39 Bankr. 564 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1984).

                        incurred by the owner that related back to the recording date of the deed of trust were those incurred through March 3, 1988, and the obligations incurred after that date did not have seniority over plaintiff's intervening mechanic's
                        lien. The agreement later made by owner and savings and loan to extend the term in which obligations could be incurred did not affect plaintiff's rights under the deed of trust as recorded. McNeary's Arborists, Inc. v. Carley Capital

                        date thereof, and subsequent liens, even though recorded or filed prior to certain advances, are junior to all advances under the future advances deed of trust. Perry v.

                        raised a plausible claim with respect to the validity and extent of the deed and was not dismissed; however, there was no merit to the trustee's allegation that the bank committed unfair and deceptive trade practices, in violation
                        of G.S. 75-16, when it allowed the corporation to carry a substantial loan balance without any repayment of principal, allowed the corporation to make interest only payments after it became insolvent, allowed the corporation to
                        make late loan payments without accelerating the debt it owed or demanding payment, and allowed the corporation to incur more trade debt while simultaneously depleting its assets. Burns v. First Bank (In re Southeastern Materials,

                    you from liability for the account. You should contact your lender to determine whether you will be able to obtain additional credit advances from your lender.

                    name and loan account of the borrower. For purposes of this section, notice shall not include a complaint or summons. Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of a borrower to enjoin a civil action, or make a counterclaim, cross-claim,
