        <p>
            The Southern States Energy Compact is hereby enacted into law and entered into with all other jurisdictions legally joining therein in the form substantially as follows:
        </p>
        <p>
            SOUTHERN STATES ENERGY COMPACT
        </p>
        <p>
            ARTICLE I. Policy and Purpose. The party states recognize that the proper employment and conservation of energy and employment of energy-related facilities, materials, and products, within the context of a responsible regard for the environment, can assist
            substantially in the industrialization of the South and the development of a balanced economy for the region. They also recognize that optimum benefit from and acquisition of energy resources and facilities require systematic encouragement,
            guidance, and assistance from the party states on a cooperative basis. It is the policy of the party states to undertake such cooperation on a continuing basis; it is the purpose of this compact to provide the instruments and framework for
            such a cooperative effort to improve the economy of the South and contribute to the individual and community well-being of the region's people.
        </p>
        <p>
            ARTICLE II. The Board. (a) There is hereby created an agency of the party states to be known as the "Southern States Energy Board" (hereinafter called the Board). The Board shall be composed of three members from each party state, one of whom shall be
            appointed or designated in each state to represent the Governor, the State Senate and the State House of Representatives, respectively. Each member shall be designated or appointed in accordance with the law of the state which he represents
            and shall serve and be subject to removal in accordance with such law. Any member of the Board may provide for the discharge of his duties and the performance of his functions thereon, either for the duration of his membership or for any lesser
            period of time, by a deputy or assistant, if the laws of his state make specific provision therefor. The federal government may be represented without vote if provision is made by federal law for such representation.
        </p>
        <p>
            (b) Each party state shall be entitled to one vote on the Board, to be determined by majority vote of each member or member's representative from the party state present and voting on any question. No action of the Board shall be binding unless taken
            at a meeting at which a majority of all party states are represented and unless a majority of the total number of votes on the Board are cast in favor thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
            (c) The Board shall have a seal.
        </p>
        <p>
            (d) The Board shall elect annually, from among its members, a chairman, a vice-chairman, and a treasurer. The Board shall appoint an Executive Director who shall serve at its pleasure and who shall also act as secretary, and who, together with the treasurer,
            shall be bonded in such amounts as the Board may require.
        </p>
        <p>
            (e) The Executive Director, with the approval of the Board, shall appoint and remove or discharge such personnel as may be necessary for the performance of the Board's functions irrespective of the civil service, personnel or other merit system laws of
            any of the party states.
        </p>
        <p>
            (f) The Board may establish and maintain, independently or in conjunction with any one or more of the party states, a suitable retirement system for its full-time employees. Employees of the Board shall be eligible for social security coverage in respect
            of old age and survivors insurance provided that the Board takes such steps as may be necessary pursuant to federal law to participate in such program of insurance as a governmental agency or unit. The Board may establish and maintain or participate
            in such additional programs of employee benefits as may be appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
            (g) The Board may borrow, accept or contract for the services of personnel from any state or the United States or any subdivision or agency thereof, from any interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation.
        </p>
        <p>
            (h) The Board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations, and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services (conditional or otherwise) from any state or the United States or any subdivision
            or agency thereof, or interstate agency, or from any institution, person, firm or corporation, and may receive, utilize, and dispose of the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            (i) The Board may establish and maintain such facilities as may be necessary for the transaction of its business. The Board may acquire, hold, and convey real and personal property and any interest therein.
        </p>
        <p>
            (j) The Board shall adopt bylaws, rules and regulations for the conduct of its business, and shall have the power to amend and rescind these bylaws, rules, and regulations. The Board shall publish its bylaws, rules, and regulations in convenient form
            and shall file a copy thereof, and shall also file a copy of any amendment thereto, with the appropriate agency or officer in each of the party states.
        </p>
        <p>
            (k) The Board annually shall make to the Governor of each party state, a report covering the activities of the Board for the preceding year, and embodying such recommendations as may have been adopted by the Board, which report shall be transmitted to
            the legislature of said state. The Board may issue such additional reports as it may deem desirable.
        </p>
        <p>
            ARTICLE III. Finances. (a) The Board shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget of its estimated expenditures for such period as may be required by the laws of that jurisdiction for presentation to
            the legislature thereof.
        </p>
        <p>
            (b) Each of the Board's budgets of estimated expenditures shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. One-half of the total amount of each budget of estimated expenditures shall be apportioned
            among the party states in equal shares; one quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states in accordance with the ratio of their populations to the total population of the entire group of party states based on the
            last decennial federal census; and one quarter of each such budget shall be apportioned among the party states on the basis of the relative average per capita income of the inhabitants in each of the party states based on the latest computations
            published by the federal census-taking agency. Subject to appropriations by their respective legislatures, the Board shall be provided with such funds by each of the party states as are necessary to provide the means of establishing and maintaining
            facilities, a staff of personnel, and such activities as may be necessary to fulfill the powers and duties imposed upon and entrusted to the Board.
        </p>
        <p>
            (c) The Board may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with funds available to it under Article II(h) of this Compact, provided that the Board takes specific action setting aside such funds prior to the incurring of any obligation to be met
            in whole or in part in this manner. Except where the Board makes use of funds available to it under Article II(h) hereof, the Board shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of funds by the party jurisdictions adequate to meet
            the same.
        </p>
        <p>
            (d) The Board shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Board shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of
            funds handled by the Board shall be audited yearly by a qualified public accountant and the report of the audit shall be included in and become a part of the annual report of the Board.
        </p>
        <p>
            (e) The accounts of the Board shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection.
        </p>
        <p>
            ARTICLE IV. Advisory Committees. The Board may establish such advisory and technical committees as it may deem necessary, membership on which to include but not be limited to private citizens, expert and lay personnel, representatives of industry, labor,
            commerce, agriculture, civic associations, medicine, education, voluntary health agencies, and officials of local, state and federal government, and may cooperate with and use the services of any such committees and the organizations which
            they represent in furthering any of its activities under this Compact.
        </p>

            (b) As to any eligible party state, this Compact shall become effective when its legislature shall have enacted the same into law: Provided that it shall not become initially effective until enacted into law by seven states.
        </p>
        <p>
            (c) Any party state may withdraw from this Compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall become effective until the Governor of the withdrawing state shall have sent formal notice in writing to the Governor of each other
            party state informing said Governors of the action of the legislature in repealing the Compact and declaring an intention to withdraw.
        </p>
        <p>
            ARTICLE IX. Severability and Construction. The provisions of this Compact and of any supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be (severable) and if any phrase, clause, sentence or provision of this Compact or such supplementary agreement is
            declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this Compact or
            such supplementary agreement and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this Compact or any supplementary agreement entered into hereunder shall be held contrary to the
            constitution of any state participating therein, the Compact or such supplementary agreement shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.
            The provisions of this Compact and of any supplementary agreement entered into pursuant thereto shall be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes thereof.
