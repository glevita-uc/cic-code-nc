       It shall be the duty and the responsibility for the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to edit and publish a second or new series of the most significant records of colonial North Carolina. From records which have been compiled in the North Carolina State Archives concerning the colonial period of North Carolina, a selection of the most significant documents shall be made therefrom by a skilled and competent editor. The editor shall edit, according to acceptable scholarly standards, the selected materials which shall be published in documentary volumes not to exceed approximately 700 pages each in length until full and representative published colonial records of North Carolina shall have been achieved. The number of copies of each volume to be so printed shall be determined by the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, and such determination shall be based on the number of copies the Department can reasonably expect to sell in a period of 10 years from the date of publication. In any year during which the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources has completed a volume and has it ready for publication, the Department may include in its base budget for that year sufficient funds to pay the estimated costs of publishing the volume. In the event that the volume is not published during that year, the appropriation made, or any unencumbered balance, shall revert to the general fund.

        Immunity.
       </b>
       - In a case in which plaintiff alleged that North Carolina violated his copyrights by publishing video footage and a still photograph that he took of a shipwreck, the federal appellate court concluded that Congress did not validly abrogate the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity with enactment of the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act. Allen v. Cooper, 895 F.3d 337 (4th Cir. 2018), aff'd, 140 S. Ct. 994, 206 L. Ed. 2d 291, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 1909 (U.S. 2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although plaintiff contended that state officials conspired to convert his copyrighted works into public documents through the enactment of G.S. 121-25(b), the only actual conduct alleged in furtherance of the conspiracy - that the officers wrote, caused to be introduced, lobbied for passage of, and obtained passage of G.S, 121-25(b) - was quintessentially legislative in nature and fell squarely within the scope of legislative immunity. Allen v. Cooper, 895 F.3d 337 (4th Cir. 2018), aff'd, 140 S. Ct. 994, 206 L. Ed. 2d 291, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 1909 (U.S. 2020).

      <p>
       To find the true value of property subject to conservation easements,
   
   the State Property Tax Commission must determine the market value prior to the granting of the easements and then reduce that value by applying a damage factor caused by the granting of the conservation easements. Determining the highest and best use of the property prior to the granting of the easement is a critical part of the appraisal process. Rainbow Springs Partnership v.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds and declares that the growth and maintenance of collections in museums and archives repositories, both public and private, is a matter of general public interest to the citizens of North Carolina. Museums and archives repositories of all kinds depend upon loans of various articles of property to promote and encourage the teaching of North Carolina and local history and to preserve and care for historical manuscripts, materials, and artifacts. The uncertainty regarding title to and responsibility for loaned property is a hindrance to museums and archives repositories in their efforts to maintain, repair, and dispose of property in their possession. The purpose of this Article is to terminate stale claims and to fairly and reasonably allocate responsibilities for the determination of title and financial responsibilities in certain cases.
