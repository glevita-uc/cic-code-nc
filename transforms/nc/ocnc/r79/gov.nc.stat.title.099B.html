        <p>
            <b>
     Purpose.
    </b> - This Chapter provides protection for merchants who merely sell products while allowing the purchaser of the product to proceed against the manufacturer of the product. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Chrysler Corp., 845 F. Supp. 1122 (M.D.N.C.
            1994).
        </p>
        <p>
            This Chapter does not adopt strict liability in product liability cases. Smith v. Fiber Controls Corp., <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 669</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 504 (1980).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            North Carolina expressly rejects strict liability in products liability actions. Bryant v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 448, 448 S.E.2d 832 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 736</cite>, 454 S.E.2d 647
            (1995).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     The North Carolina legislature intended to establish a fixed cut-off date
    </b> to bar actions brought after six years involving an injury caused by a manufactured good. A defendant escapes liability if the action is not brought within the six-year window provided by G.S. 1-50(6) (now G.S. 1-50(a)(6)). Lindsay
            v. Public Serv. Co., 725 F. Supp. 278 (W.D.N.C. 1989), appeal dismissed, 732 F. Supp. 623 (W.D.N.C. 1990).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     With No Exception for Failure to Warn.
    </b> - The statute of repose, G.S. 1-50(6) (now G.S. 1-50(a)(6)), as incorporated into this Chapter, the North Carolina products liability statute, anticipates that the statute includes any action brought for or on account of personal
            injury. Specifically, the statute includes those injuries caused by or resulting from a warning or lack thereof. Thus, the statute of repose contains no exception for failure to warn. Lindsay v. Public Serv. Co., 725 F. Supp. 278 (W.D.N.C.
            1989), appeal dismissed, 732 F. Supp. 623 (W.D.N.C. 1990).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Inadequate Warnings.
    </b> - Action against defendant pharmaceutical manufacturers for plaintiff's personal injury (tardive dyskinesia) allegedly caused by or resulting from the manufacturers' inadequate warnings associated with a name-brand drug, though brought
            under a myriad of claims - including negligence. breach of undertaking special duty, misrepresentation by omission, negligent misrepresentation, constructive fraud, fraud by concealment, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent
            infliction of emotional distress, unfair and deceptive trade practices, breach of express warranty, and breach of implied warranties - clearly fell within North Carolina's definition of a product liability action under G.S. 99B-1(3). Couick
            v. Wyeth, Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. Mar. 8, 2010).
        </p>
        <p>
            Period of Limitations. - Section 1-50(6) (now G.S. 1-50(a)(6)) was enacted with this Chapter to provide a period of limitations for actions to which this Chapter applies. Bernick v. Jurden, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 435</cite>, 293 S.E.2d
            405 (1982).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Statute of Repose. - This section does not completely eviscerate the statute of repose in the case of minors and others under disability. If a product is over six years old at the time of injury, which would be the time that the claim accrues, than the
            statute of repose operates as a total bar on that claim; however, if a claim accrues before the six year statute of repose has expired, this section simply operates to extend the time period within which a minor or other with disability may
            bring suit under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.099B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 99B</a></cite>. Therefore, claims accruing after six years will still be barred. Bryant v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite>            448, 448 S.E.2d 832 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 736</cite>, 454 S.E.2d 647 (1995).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Recovery for Economic Losses. - In the context of a products liability suit, purely economic losses cannot ordinarily be recovered in an action for negligence. Chicopee, Inc. v. Sims Metal Works, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite>            423, 391 S.E.2d 211 (1990), appeal withdrawn, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 329</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 826 (1991).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Recoverable Losses.
    </b> - With respect to what losses are recoverable in a products liability suit, North Carolina follows the majority rule and does not allow recovery of purely economic losses in an action for negligence. AT &amp; T Corp. v. Medical Review
            of N.C. Inc., 876 F. Supp. 91 (E.D.N.C. 1995).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Purely Economic Loss.
    </b> - Purely economic loss is not recoverable under tort law in a products liability action in North Carolina. AT &amp; T Corp. v. Medical Review of N.C. Inc., 876 F. Supp. 91 (E.D.N.C. 1995).
        </p>
        <p>
            Where third party plaintiff claimed it was entitled to maintain an action under the Products Liability Act that would fall within the exception to the privity requirement in the context of breach or implied warranty, but did not allege that defects in
            the voice mail system resulted in any physical injury or property damage and only alleged economic loss, the general rule regarding privity remained intact and third party plaintiff could not maintain its breach of implied warranty claim.
            AT &amp; T Corp. v. Medical Review of N.C. Inc., 876 F. Supp. 91 (E.D.N.C. 1995).
        </p>
        <p>
            The imprinting of retailer's trademark in shoe was insufficient to bring retailer within the definition of manufacturer in subdivision (2) of this section. Morrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 224,
            341 S.E.2d 40, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 298</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 495 (1987).

        <p>
            "Party." - G.S. 99B-3 defense could not be relied upon to argue that a car accident victim's parent placed the seatbelt behind her improperly as neither parent was a "party" to the action under G.S. 99B-1, as required by G.S. 99B-3. Stark v. Ford Motor
            Co., <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 693 S.E.2d 253 (2010), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 468</cite>, 723 S.E.2d 753, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 266 (N.C. 2012).

        <p>
            "Selling" encompasses delivery of products. Champs Convenience Stores, Inc. v. United Chem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 392 S.E.2d 761 (1990), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 446</cite>, 406 S.E.2d

            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Action of Breach of Implied Warranty of Merchantability. - The implied warranty of merchantability arises under the UCC upon the sale of goods when the seller is a merchant with respect to goods of the kind sold. The term "product liability action" as
            used in the Products Liability Act includes "any action brought for or on account of personal injury, death or property damage caused by or resulting from . . . the selling . . . of any product." Therefore, an action of breach of implied warranty
            of merchantability under the UCC is a "product liability action" within the meaning of the Products Liability Act if the action is for injury to person or property resulting from the sale of a product. Morrison v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.,
            <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 298</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 495 (1987).

        </p>
        <p>
            Negligence Action for Injuries Caused by the Warning or Instructing of Products. - Although the legislature did not undertake to define what "products" are covered by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.099B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 99B</a></cite>,
            subsection (3) of this section anticipates, that a products liability action may include an action for personal injuries caused by or resulting from the "warning or instructing" of any product. Driver v. Burlington Aviation, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite>            519, 430 S.E.2d 476 (1993).
        </p>
        <p>
            Where plaintiff's amended complaint alleged that aircraft manufacturer had a duty to the pilot and his passengers to provide complete and accurate instruction concerning various mechanical functions, and that the manual wrongfully instructed concerning
            these functions and that the negligence of the aircraft manufacturer actually and proximately caused the damages to the plaintiffs, the allegations were sufficient to state a claim for relief based on a theory of negligence against the aircraft
            manufacturer in the preparation and publication of the information manual. Driver v. Burlington Aviation, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 430 S.E.2d 476 (1993).

     Drug Companies Not Liable for Defective Warnings Issued by Another Drug Company.
    </b> - In a case in which two drug companies moved for summary judgment on the claims against them, which were a variety of tort claims, those claims by a patient and his wife were nonetheless product liability claims, and the two drug
            companies could not be held liable for the warnings issued by a third drug company. The first two drug companies manufactured and distributed metoclopramide under its brand name, the third drug company manufactured and distributed generic
            metoclopramide, and at no time had the patient purchased or ingested metoclopramide manufactured by the first two drug companies. Stoddard v. Wyeth, Inc., 630 F. Supp. 2d 631 (E.D.N.C. June 23, 2009).

    </b> - In a products liability action wherein a North Carolina minor died after being hit in the chest with an electrical control device (ECD) by the police, the federal district court denied the ECD manufacturer's motion for a judgment
            notwithstanding the verdict as the court found that the manufacturer's reliance on North Carolina's product liability statute, G.S. 99B-4(3), as to contributory negligence, was not applicable because that statute has been held to only apply
            to when a plaintiff has negligently used a product and the minor never had used the ECD product previously. Fontenot v. Taser Int'l, Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. Apr. 20, 2012).

            Interlocutory Review of Discovery Order. - When a homeowners' association sued a manufacturer for product liability under G.S. 99B-1 et seq., and a trial court ordered the association to return documents to the manufacturer that were inadvertently released
            to the association in discovery, the association could not immediately appeal the order under G.S. 1-277 or G.S. 7A-27(d)(1) on the theory that the order affected the association's substantial right, because: (1) the association did not identify
            a right that was affected or show how such a right would be jeopardized without immediate review; (2) unsupported opinions in a memo the association was ordered to return to the manufacturer did not affect a substantial right, as the memo
            did not show what the manufacturer's employees, outside testers and experts, knew about the product's adequacy and when the employees knew the information, and such prior knowledge was not critical to claims against the manufacturer; and (3),
            if such knowledge were critical, the memo did not contribute significantly to a determination of the issue. Harbour Point Homeowners' Ass'n v. DJF Enters., <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 697 S.E.2d 439 (2010).

            Manufacturer of a machine which is dangerous because of the way in which it functions, and patently so, owes to those who use it a duty merely to make it free from latent defects and concealed dangers. In a case against such a manufacturer, the plaintiff
            must prove the existence of a latent defect or of a danger not known to the plaintiff or other users. McCollum v. Grove Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 293 S.E.2d 632, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 695</cite>,

            Protection Against Obvious Defects Not Required. - A manufacturer has no duty to equip his product with safety devices to protect against defects and dangers that are obvious. In cases dealing with a manufacturer's liability for injuries to remote users,
            the courts have always stressed the duty of guarding against hidden defects and of giving notice of concealed dangers. McCollum v. Grove Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 283, 293 S.E.2d 632, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 695</cite>,

     Liability Under Crashworthiness Theory.
    </b> - Under the law of North Carolina, an automobile manufacturer would not be held liable for defects in the design and manufacture of a vehicle which neither caused nor contributed to the cause of a collision, but served to exacerbate
            injuries sustained thereafter. Wilson v. Ford Motor Co., 656 F.2d 960 (4th Cir. 1981).
        </p>
        <p>
            Where 1964 Volkswagen occupied by decedents and designed, manufactured and distributed by VW, burst into flames due to an allegedly defective gas tank when it was struck by a 1972 Dodge being operated on the wrong side of the highway, and it was not alleged
            that the defective gas tank caused the collision, the district court erred in denying VW's motions for dismissal and for summary judgment in a suit to recover damages for the wrongful deaths of decedents as a result of the alleged failure
            of VW to design a crashworthy vehicle. Martin v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 707 F.2d 823 (4th Cir. 1983).

            In action to recover for death of farm worker who died after drinking pesticide, trial court properly entered summary judgment for the seller of the pesticide where plaintiff did not present any specific facts tending to show that the seller knew or should

            In action to recover for wrongful death of a farm laborer who drank a toxic pesticide, trial court erred in entering summary judgment for the manufacturer of the pesticide where evidence raised questions for the jury as to whether the manufacturer exercised
            the required degree of due care in its general manufacture and packaging of the pesticide, whether the manufacturer failed to provide adequate warnings on the product's label to notify others of its toxicity, and whether the manufacturer's
            first aid instructions on the product's label were ambiguous and incomplete. Ziglar v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 147, 280 S.E.2d 510, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 393</cite>,

            Language in Seller's Ad Held "Puffing." - Seller's advertisement that it sold "America's most complete line of reliable, economical gas heating appliances" was, under the Uniform Commercial Code, "a statement purporting to be merely the seller's opinion
            or commendation of the goods does not create warranty." Seller's statement that the heater was "reliable" could not be regarded by the buyers to be part of the reason for their purchase; therefore, the language in seller's advertisement was
            mere puffing and not an express warranty. Warzynski v. Empire Comfort Sys., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 222, 401 S.E.2d 801 (1991).

            Recovery from Manufacturer Barred. - Where the forecast of evidence demonstrated that a proximate cause of plaintiff 's injury was the modification or alteration of machine in question by a party other than the manufacturer after it left the control of
            the manufacturer, and that the alteration of the machine was contrary to the instructions of the manufacturer and done without its express consent, this section barred recovery from the manufacturer. Rich v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite>            489, 391 S.E.2d 220, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 432</cite>, 395 S.E.2d 689 (1990).

            Product liability claim against a restaurant franchisor based on an employee's spitting into a customer's food was properly dismissed; even if the franchisor had manufactured the food, the food was altered in a manner not originally intended by the franchisor,

            Manufacturer of a home heater was not liable to consumers for carbon monoxide poisoning under G.S. 99B-3 because the heater had been converted from a natural gas unit to one using liquefied petroleum after it left the manufacturer's control. Edmondson

            Defense Available to Manufacturer. - When it was alleged that a minor was injured by a defective seat belt system, and G.S. 99B-3 provided a defense to a manufacturer when a "party" altered or modified an allegedly defective product after the product
            left the manufacturer, it was error to grant the minor a directed verdict that the defense was not available to the system's manufacturer because (1) sufficient evidence allowed a jury to find the minor's father modified the seat belt system
            before the minor's injuries, and (2) this evidence sustained a judgment applying the statute to relieve the manufacturer of liability. Stark v. Ford Motor Co., <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 468</cite>, 723 S.E.2d 753 (2012).

        <p>
            Misuse of Product Must Be a Proximate Cause. - In order for this section to act as a bar to plaintiff's recovery, the minor plaintiff's misuse of the fence and gate must have been a proximate cause of her injury, and since issues of proximate cause and
            foreseeability are best left to a jury, summary judgment was improper. Hastings v. Seegars Fence Co., <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 493 S.E.2d 782 (1997).

        <p>
            When it was alleged that a minor was injured by a defective seat belt system, a manufacturer could assert the defense provided in G.S. 99B-3, when a "party" altered or modified an allegedly defective product after the product left the manufacturer, because,
            as used in the statute, the word "party" was not limited to a party to the litigation, since (1) the word's use showed the general assembly intended the term to include anyone altering the product, whether or not a party to the litigation,
            subject to other statutory requirements, (2) one altering the product became a "party," as used in the statute, at the time of modification, before any litigation, showing the defense applied when anyone other than a manufacturer or seller
            altered the product, (3) this interpretation was consistent with pattern jury instructions and scholarly commentary, and (4) limiting "party" to a party to the litigation read words into the statute that the general assembly chose not to use.

            Jury Instruction Regarding Product Design Was Properly Denied Absent Evidence That Manufacturer Designed the Product in Issue - In an action by a worker against a clamp manufacturer after the worker was injured when a clamp failed on an irrigation system,
            the trial court properly refused to give the worker's requested jury instruction that a manufacturer had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the design of a product, as there was no evidence that the manufacturer designed the clamp. Evans

     No Duty to Protect From Improper Use of Product.
    </b> - Manufacturers of a texting system were entitled to dismissal in a negligence action because they were not liable under G.S. 99B-6 where the automobile accident in the case was caused by the driver's inattention, not any element
            of the design or manufacture of the texting system; fact that using the system could have resulted in a driver negligently operating a motor vehicle did not create any duty on the part of the manufacturers to protect third parties from a driver's

            Summary Judgment Improper Where Conflict Raised by Consumer's Expert. - Summary judgment was improperly granted to a motorcycle helmet manufacturer in a consumer's action alleging that the manufacturer unreasonably failed to adopt a safer, feasible design

            Summary Judgment Properly Denied. - Accident victims produced sufficient evidence under G.S. 99B-6 to survive a car manufacturer's motions for summary judgment and directed verdict in their suit brought to recover for injuries sustained in a car accident
            as the victims offered evidence that tended to show that the manufacturer made a produce which had the potential to cause the injury suffered by the victims. Though there were alternative designs available at the time which were used by the
            manufacturer in similar products, the product used by the manufacturer did not include these alternative designs. Stark v. Ford Motor Co., <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 693 S.E.2d 253 (2010), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 468</cite>,
