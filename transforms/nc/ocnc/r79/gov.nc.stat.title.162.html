       Editor's Note.
      </b> - An amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981, c. 504, s. 10, was made effective upon certification of approval of the constitutional amendments proposed by ss. 1 to 3 of the act. The constitutional amendments were
                    submitted to the people at an election held June 29, 1982, and were defeated. Therefore, the 1981 amendment to this section never went into effect.

                        A sheriff is no longer considered to have a vested right in his office, nor is his tenure considered to be based upon a contract with the State. Mial v. Ellington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 131</cite>, 46 S.E. 961 (1903),
                        overruling Hoke v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. 1</cite> (1833) and all cases following it in holding a public office to be private property.

                    <p>
                        Effect of Constitutional Amendment on Term of Office. - The term of office of sheriffs-elect begins on the first Monday in December next ensuing their election, and the constitutional amendment changing the term of office of sheriffs from two to four
                        years, approved by the voters in the election of 1938, being in effect on the first Monday in December, the date of the beginning of the term of the sheriffs elected in that election, their term of office was four years in accordance
                        with the amendment then in effect. Freeman v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 63</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 894 (1940).

                        to try the question as to which of the parties is entitled to the office. Loftin v. Sowers, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 251</cite> (1871).

                        Full Settlement of Public Funds Required of Incumbent. - A person, although elected by the qualified voters of a county to the office of sheriff, would not be eligible for said office, if he, having been theretofore sheriff of said county, had failed

                        Incumbent to Produce Receipts. - A former sheriff must exhibit to the board of commissioners the receipts in full of the proper officers, for all public funds which he received, or ought to have received during his preceding official term, before he will
                        be permitted to reenter upon a new term. Colvard v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 515</cite> (1886); Lenoir County v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 336</cite>, 130 S.E. 25 (1925).

                    <p>
                        The fact that incumbent was able, ready and willing at the time of tendering his bond, to make settlement and payment of any liability on account of funds so received, does not dispense with the requirement that he shall produce receipts in full. Colvard

                        Appointment by Commissioners for Unexpired Term Only. - In case of a vacancy in the sheriff's office, it is within the power of the board of county commissioners to appoint for the unexpired term only. People ex rel. Worley v. Smith,
                        <cite

                    <p>
                        Appointment by Commissioners Where Sheriff-Elect Fails to Qualify. - Where a sheriff-elect failed to qualify as sheriff for the term to which he had been elected, it became the duty of the board of commissioners forthwith to elect some suitable person
                        in the county as sheriff for the unexpired term. Lenoir County v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 336</cite>, 130 S.E. 25 (1925).

                    <p>
                        As Where Incumbent Is in Arrears on Reelection. - It is the duty of the county commissioners to declare the sheriff's office vacant, and appoint someone for the unexpired term, whenever the incumbent thereof is found to be, on reelection, in arrears in
                        his settlement of the public taxes. People ex rel. McNeill v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 329</cite> (1876).

                    <p>
                        Commissioners' Appointee Held Entitled to Office. - Where S was appointed sheriff in 1875, to fill a vacancy, and held the office until May, 1877, and in November, 1876, an election was held, and upon the result of certain legal proceedings in May, 1877,
                        M was declared to be elected sheriff, but M failed to give bond, and the county commissioners declared a vacancy and appointed B to fill the same, it was held that S had no right to hold over until the next popular election, but
                        that B was entitled to the office, having been elected by the commissioners. State ex rel. Sneed v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 132</cite> (1879).

                    <p>
                        Upon the insanity of the sheriff, his right to exercise the office ceases and the agency of his deputies is terminated, and his committal to a hospital for the insane and the appointment of a guardian for him are certainly at least prima facie evidence
                        of such insanity. Somers v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 582</cite>, 31 S.E. 873 (1898).

                    <p>
                        Collection of Taxes When Sheriff Becomes Insane. - Upon the prima facie ascertainment of the insanity of the sheriff, or by inquisition of lunacy, the commissioners may declare the office vacant, under this section, but their failure to do so merely authorizes
                        the coroner to perform the duties of sheriff proper, until such declaration, and does not cast upon him the right to collect the taxes, which goes to the sheriff's bondsmen for the current list, and after that devolves upon a tax
                        collector chosen by the county commissioners. Somers v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 582</cite>, 31 S.E. 873 (1898). See also, Greer v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 678</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Upon the declaration of insanity, the sureties of the sheriff have no more rights than would have gone to them upon his death to collect the tax list then in his hands, and the commissioners are vested with the power of electing a tax collector for the
                        ensuing year, unless and until the sheriff should be restored to reason. Somers v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 582</cite>, 31 S.E. 873 (1898).

                        Termination of Deputy Sheriff. - Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be lawfully
                        terminated for political reasons under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary to ensure
                        that the sheriff's policies are carried out. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

                <p>
                    The sheriff shall furnish a bond payable to the State of North Carolina for the due execution and return of process, the payment of fees and moneys collected, and the faithful execution of his office as sheriff, which shall be conditioned as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    The condition of the above obligation is such that, whereas the above bounden ________ is elected and appointed sheriff of ________ County; if therefore, he shall well and truly execute and due return make of all process and precepts to him directed,
                    and pay and satisfy all fees and sums of money by him received or levied by virtue of any process into the proper office into which the same, by the tenor thereof, ought to be paid, or to the person to whom the same shall be due, his
                    executors, administrators, attorneys, or agents; and in all other things well and truly and faithfully execute the said office of sheriff during his continuance therein, then above obligation to be void; otherwise to remain in full

                <p>
                    The amount of the bond shall be determined by the board of county commissioners, but shall not exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).

                            No Right of Commissioners to Refuse Bonds. - When a sheriff-elect has fulfilled all the statutory requirements as to the execution of bonds, the county commissioners may not refuse said bonds and deprive the rightful holder of his office. Sikes v. Commissioners
                            of Bladen County, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 34</cite> (1875).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where sheriff failed to comply with the requirements of this section, he was not entitled to have the county commissioners induct him into office, notwithstanding the fact that at the beginning of his term there was a tax collector in that county. Colvard

                        <p>
                            Ceremony and Registration Not Essential. - The ceremony of acknowledgment in open court, and registration, are not essential to the validity of a sheriff's bond. State ex rel. McLean v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 444</cite>                            (1862).

                        <p>
                            Bond Held Valid as Voluntary Bond. - Where a bond made payable to the State was given by a sheriff for the discharge of public duties, but was not taken in the manner or by the persons designated by law to take it, it would nevertheless be good as a voluntary
                            bond; being for the benefit of the State, the State would be presumed to have accepted it when it was delivered to third person for its benefit. State ex rel. Davis v. McAlpin, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 140</cite>                            (1843).

                            If a sheriff voluntarily gives bond, with sureties, in an amount larger than prescribed by law, they will be liable for a breach thereof. State Bank of North Carolina v. Twitty, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. 5</cite> (1822);
                            Governor ex rel. Henderson v. Matlock, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. 366</cite> (1823).

                        <p>
                            Form of Bond Held Sufficient. - A sheriff's bond to "his Excellency M.S. Captain General and Commander in Chief, in and over the State of North Carolina in the sum of $10,000 to be paid to his Excellency, the Governor, his successor and assigns:" was
                            a bond payable to the Governor in his official capacity, and was an official bond within the act of 1823, which was in force when it was taken. Governor ex rel. Huggins v. Montford, <cite class="nc_code">23 N.C. 155</cite>                            (1840).

                            Demand is not necessary before suit by county treasurer on sheriff's bond, as the sheriff is required by law to settle on or before a day certain. McGuire v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 349</cite>, 31 S.E. 627
                            (1898).

                        <p>
                            Previous Settlements Prima Facie Correct. - Previous settlements with the sheriff, when approved by the board of commissioners, are prima facie correct, and the burden of proving to the contrary rests upon them. Commissioners of Iredell County v. White,
                            <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 534</cite>, 31 S.E. 670 (1898).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The return of a sheriff that a fieri facias is satisfied is conclusive upon his sureties in an action on his official bond. Governor ex rel. State Bank v. Twitty, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. 153</cite> (1827).

                            Failure to Have Insolvent's Allowance Made. - Where a sheriff failed to settle for taxes within the time appointed by law and did not have allowance made him by the commissioners for insolvents at the time and in the manner prescribed by law, he could
                            not have such allowances made by the court in an action brought against him on his official bond for the balance due by him on the tax list. Board of Comm'rs v. Wall, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 377</cite>,

                            however, he and his sureties are liable in an action on the bond for the taxes misappropriated for such defalcation. McGuire v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 349</cite>, 31 S.E. 627 (1898).

                            Bond Held Not to Cover Injury Caused by Prisoner While Unlawfully at Large as Trusty. - Where suit was brought on bond providing for liability if the sheriff failed to properly execute and return all process or properly pay all moneys received by him
                            by virtue of any process, "and in all things well and truly and faithfully execute the said office of sheriff," the general provisions of the bond as to the sheriff's faithful performance of the duties of the office related
                            to the specific obligations therein set out as to service and return of process, and neither the sheriff nor the sureties on his bond was liable thereon in a civil action for damages for a negligent injury inflicted by a prisoner
                            lawfully entrusted to the custody of the sheriff while such prisoner was unlawfully permitted by the sheriff to be at large as a trusty. Sutton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 546</cite>,

                            Recovery in Excess of Bond. - In a wrongful death action arising from an incident at a county jail, although the sheriff claimed that sovereign immunity entitled him to summary judgment as a matter of law to the extent plaintiffs - the decedent's mother
                            and the administrator of his estate, sought to recover damages in excess of the sheriff's official bond under G.S. 162-8 and G.S. 58-76-5, plaintiffs' claims were not barred by exclusions in the county's liability insurance
                            under G.S. 153A-435; although the policy excluded coverage for claims arising from criminal behavior and plaintiffs claimed the sheriff was negligent by violating G.S. 153A-224 - a Class 1 misdemeanor, other grounds were alleged
                            for the sheriff's negligence. Myers v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 655 S.E.2d 882, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 360</cite>, 664 S.E.2d 309 (2008).

                            Former Sheriff's Bond Held Not Breached by Act of Duty Under Successor. - Where deputy of a sheriff received the note of a married woman for collection within a magistrate's jurisdiction and failed to collect the same during the sheriff's official term,
                            but afterwards, when acting as the deputy of his successor, collected it and failed to pay over the money, there was no breach of the former sheriff's official bond. State ex rel. Graham v. Buchanan,

                            bond, and again appointed the former sheriff, who gave the necessary bonds and then qualified, his term was by virtue of his appointment by the board of county commissioners, and the liability of the sureties on his official

                            Coverage of Bonds Limited to Years Stated. - Where an action was brought on the bonds of a sheriff given in 1872 and 1873 and conditioned only for those years, such bonds could not be enlarged to embrace a default occurring in the year 1874 on the ground
                            that the law required a bond for the principal's whole term of office. State ex rel. Prince v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 398</cite> (1877).

                            What Sureties Liable for Taxes Received Under Lists Furnished Preceding Year. - A sheriff's sureties for one year are not liable for any taxes received by him under the lists furnished in the preceding year; but the sureties of that year are liable. Fitts

                            Where sheriff, elected in 1872, continued to exercise duties of office after failure to renew his bond and produce his receipts, and was reelected in 1874, and failed to collect and pay over the taxes for that year, it was held that he was liable on his
                            bond of 1872. State ex rel. Vann. v. Pipkin, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 408</cite> (1877). See also State ex rel. Moore County v. McIntosh, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. 307</cite> (1848); State

                            Liability on Earlier Bond Not Discharged by Giving of Subsequent Bond. - The various bonds separately required to be given by the sheriff under this section impose a distinct liability on the sureties on each bond separately for the terms of office for
                            which given; hence, where a bond is given by the same surety for the same sheriff for more than one successive term, the giving of the bond for the succeeding term does not discharge the bond previously given, nor release the
                            surety from liability thereon, and a separate cause of action will lie against the surety on the bond for each term. Pender County v. King, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 50</cite>, 147 S.E. 695

                            Coverage of Bond When New Duty Added by Statute. - Where a statute requires a bond from an officer for the faithful discharge of his duty, and a new duty is attached to the office by statute, such bond, given subsequently to the latter statute, embraces
                            such new duty, and is a security for its performance, unless when the new duty is attached a bond is required to be given specifically for its performance. State ex rel. Boger v. Bradshaw,

                            Surety's Liability Not Affected by Change in Sheriff's Compensation. - The liability of a surety on a sheriff's bond given under this section is not affected by the fact that the sheriff, pending the life of the bond, has been put upon a salary instead
                            of a fee basis or that the amount of his salary has been changed under the authority of a statute. Pender County v. King, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 50</cite>, 147 S.E. 695 (1929).

         Waiver of Immunity.
        </b> - In an action in which soldiers, who were shot by a sheriff's deputy, sought to hold the sheriff in his official capacity liable on the basis of respondeat superior for the alleged assault and battery committed
                            by the deputy, the sheriff's governmental immunity was waived pursuant to G.S. 58-76-5 by the purchase of a statutorily required bond under G.S. 162-8 because the sheriff's surety was joined as a party. Massasoit v. Carter,

                            Trial court did not err in denying a sheriff and a surety summary judgment in a former employee's action asserting retaliatory termination because the sheriff waived governmental immunity by purchasing an official bond; the employee's claim, if supported
                            by adequate proof, came within the scope of the sheriff's official duties because she alleged that the sheriff wrongfully terminated her employment in retaliation for her decision to file a workers' compensation claim. White

                            one moiety to the party aggrieved, and the other to anyone who will sue for the same; 3) An action for damages by the party aggrieved; 4) An amercement nisi for $100.00 in justices' courts, on "motion and proof" by the party

                            Making Due Return Is an Affirmative Requirement. - The requirements that an officer having process in hand for service must note on the process the date received by him under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>,

                            Due Return May Be Mixed Question of Law and Fact. - Whether, in any particular case, a due return has been made, may involve questions both of law and fact. Whether the return is a proper one in form and substance is a question of law to be decided by
                            the court, but whether it was made in proper time is a question of fact to be decided by the jury. Waugh v. Brittain, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 470</cite> (1857).

                            Controlling Effect of Exemption Laws. - The provisions of the exemption laws (N.C. Const., Art. X, and the statutes passed in pursuance thereof) so modify Battle's Revisal, c. 106, G.S. 15 (now this section) as not to authorize the infliction of the penalty
                            therein imposed for obedience to said exemption laws. Richardson v. Wicker, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 172</cite> (1879).

                            An amercement is a penalty for a fixed sum without regard to the amount of plaintiff's damage. Thompson v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 484</cite> (1871); Brogden Produce Co. v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 608</cite>,

                            Purpose of Penalty. - The $100.00 is given to the plaintiff in the execution upon the theory that he is aggrieved, but chiefly as a punishment to the officer and to stimulate him to active obedience. Brogden Produce Co. v. Stanley,
                            <cite

                            Sheriff cannot be amerced if he returns an execution within the time prescribed by law, even though he fails to return the money levied thereon into court or pay it to the party or his attorney. Davis v. Lancaster, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. 255</cite>                            (1809); Cockerham v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 288</cite> (1859).

                            Time for Return. - Executions shall be returnable to the term (session) of the court next after that from which they bear teste; the sheriff is allowed all the days of the term (session) to return an execution, unless he be ruled, upon motion and cause
                            shown, to return it on some intermediate day. Person v. Newsom, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 142</cite> (1882); Turner v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 291</cite>, 16 S.E. 174 (1892).

                            A sheriff who fails to make return of process before the adjournment of the court to which it is returnable is subject to the penalty prescribed by statute. Boyd v. Teague, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 246</cite>, 16 S.E.

                            Process Must Be Delivered 20 Days Before Session. - To bring a delinquent officer within the provisions of this section and subject him to its pains, process must be delivered to him 20 days before it is to be returned, and there must be "proof of such
                            delivery." Yeargin v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 326</cite> (1881).

                        <p>
                            Delivery of Process by Mail. - The proof was sufficient for an amercement nisi under former rulings where it was shown that the process in an envelope properly directed and with postage prepaid was deposited in the post office in time to enable it to
                            reach its destination in the due course of the mail 20 days before the session of the court to which it was returnable. State v. Latham, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. 233</cite> (1858); Yeargin v.

                            When Writ Sent to Wrong Sheriff. - If a clerk sent a writ to the sheriff of another county, enclosed in a stamped envelope, in due time to reach him in the regular course of the mails, 20 days before the sitting of the court to which it was returnable,
                            it would be sufficient to authorize a judgment nisi for an amercement for the nonreturn of the process. State v. Latham, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. 233</cite> (1858); Cockerham v. Baker,
                            <cite

                        <p>
                            Making Return by Mail. - If the mail can be used as a medium by which process can be transmitted to a sheriff, so as to charge him with its reception, it would seem that he ought to be allowed to adopt the same means for making his return, at least so
                            far as the due time of the return is involved. In Waugh v. Brittain, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 470</cite> (1857), it was intimated that he might do so, and that he would be excused if the letter
                            endorsing the process, with his return upon it, was properly mailed in due time. Cockerham v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 288</cite> (1859).

                            Sheriff who goes out of office before return day of writ is not subject to amercement for failure to return it. McLin v.

                            Until his fees are paid or tendered, sheriff is not bound to execute process. Johnson v. Kenneday, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 435</cite> (1874).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Pay Fees as Excuse for Failure to Make Return. - Though a sheriff is not required to execute process until his fees are paid or tendered by the person at whose expense the service is to be rendered, he is not excused thereby for a failure to
                            make a return of process; for, if he has any excuse for not executing the writ, he must state it in his return. Jones v. Gupton, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 48</cite> (1871).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            The highest considerations of public policy require that sheriffs shall not be negligent in the service of process committed to them. Ignorance of the officer is no excuse. Whether any damage was done to the plaintiff is immaterial. The amercement is
                            for failure to discharge an official duty. Brogden Produce Co. v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 608</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 689 (1966).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            It is no excuse that the sheriff has no corrupt or bad intentions and that the plaintiff is saved from any resulting injury by the voluntary appearance of the defendant. Brogden Produce Co. v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 608</cite>,
                            148 S.E.2d 689 (1966).

                        <p>
                            Endorsing Process "Served". - While it is a better practice for officers to make their returns of process show with particularity upon whom and in what manner the process was served, their endorsement "served" implies service as the law requires, and
                            such return, signed by the officer in his official capacity, is sufficient to show prima facie service at least; error in the date of service is immaterial. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 648</cite>,
                            55 S.E.2d 177 (1949).

                        <p>
                            Endorsing Execution "Satisfied". - Where a sheriff merely endorsed upon an execution the word "satisfied," without stating what disposition he had made of the fund, the return was nevertheless sufficient in law to relieve him from an amercement for not
                            making due return. Wyche v. Newsom, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 142</cite> (1882).

                            Order Restraining Further Prosecution of Action in Which Execution Issued. - Where sheriff failed to serve execution of a judgment against defendant in summary ejectment to remove her from land because of an intervening order restraining plaintiff from
                            further prosecuting the summary ejectment, issued in a prior pending action to try title, motion to amerce the sheriff for failure to serve the execution was properly denied, since the sheriff had shown sufficient cause for
                            failing to serve the execution. Massengill v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 35</cite>, 44 S.E.2d 356 (1947).

                        <p>
                            Liability of Sheriff. - Where a scire facias was issued on a judgment, the sheriff was liable to amercement for failure to return the process, even though the parties had agreed, while it was in the sheriff's hands, that the collection of the money should
                            be suspended, so as to enable them to make a full settlement. Morrow v. Allison, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. 217</cite> (1850).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            An agreement to suspend collection of the debt, or to stay the execution, as it is commonly called, even if communicated to the sheriff, gives no authority to the officers not to return the writ. Brogden Produce Co. v. Stanley,

                            Belief That Lien Was Divested by Subsequent Legislation. - A sheriff is liable to be amerced for a return on a vend. ex. of "no goods," etc., after levy, although made in the belief that the lien has been divested by subsequent legislation. McKeithan

                            Erroneous Impression of Return Day. - It is not a defense to an action to recover the penalty prescribed by the section that sheriff had the erroneous impression that the summons was returnable at a later date, and that his failure to make his return
                            within the time required was occasioned by endeavoring to obtain service. Bell v. Wycoff, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 245</cite>, 42 S.E. 608 (1902).

                            Refusal or Inability of Clerk to Receive Return. - It is not a sufficient excuse to an officer for neglecting to return a process to the proper term (session) of the court that he had tendered it to the clerk, who had refused to receive it, nor that the
                            clerk had died during the term (session). Hamlin v. March, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. 35</cite> (1848).

                            Failure to Collect Where Debtor Had No Property in Excess of Exemptions. - A sheriff was not liable to amercement for failure to have in court the amount of an execution issued on a judgment for a debt contracted prior to 1868, when the judgment debtor
                            had no property in excess of his exemptions, under the applicable law. Richardson v. Wicker, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 172</cite> (1879).

                            A return by sheriff on a fieri facias that he had levied on goods subject to older executions, without stating whether he had sold the property seized or still held it, was not a due return, and subjected him to amercement. Buckley v. Hampton,

                            A return of a sheriff to a fieri facias that "he had made a levy on personal property and taken a forthcoming bond, but had not sold it, that the obligors did not deliver the property on the day, and that, after the day, it was too late to make a sale,"
                            was not such a "due return" of the process as will exempt the sheriff for amercement. Frost v. Rowland, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. 385</cite> (1845).

                            Where a sheriff endorsed upon an execution the words "debt and interest due to sheriff, costs paid into office," and upon another the word "satisfied," without stating what disposition he had made of the fund, the returns were held to be sufficient in
                            law to relieve the sheriff from amercement for not making "due return." Person v. Newsom, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 142</cite> (1882).

                            Setting Aside Judgment Absolute. - In a proceeding to enforce the statutory penalty against a sheriff for failure to make due return of process, it is not error to set aside a judgment absolute where it appears that he had no notice of the rule upon him
                            to show cause. Yeargin v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 326</cite> (1881).

                            Amercement at Subsequent Session. - A sheriff who fails to execute and return process shall be subject to a penalty to be paid to the party aggrieved, by order of the court, on motion and proof that process was delivered to him before the sitting of the
                            court to which it was returnable, unless the sheriff shows sufficient cause to the court for his failure "at the court next succeeding such order." And there is nothing in the statute to prevent a sheriff who does not return
                            process from being amerced at a subsequent term (session) to that to which the return should have been made. Halcombe v. Rowland, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. 240</cite> (1848).

                            Falseness in Point of Fact Essential to Liability. - In order to render a sheriff liable for a false return under the section, falsehood must be found in the statement of facts in the return. Harrell v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 259</cite>,
                            6 S.E. 777 (1888), overruled on other grounds in Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 159 (1977).

                        <p>
                            For the sheriff to incur the heavy $500.00 penalty, the return must be false in point of fact, and not false merely as importing, from facts truly stated, a wrong legal conclusion. Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>,
                            235 S.E.2d 159 (1977).

                        <p>
                            To subject one to the heavy penalty of this section, the falseness must be stated as a fact and not merely by way of inference from facts. Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 159 (1977).

                            A false inference in a return will render the return false only if the facts are omitted from the return. Where the facts underlying the inference or conclusion are truly stated in the return there can be no liability for a false return, even though the
                            sheriff may still be exposed to a lesser liability for failing to execute the writ or for not making a proper and legal return. Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>, 235 S.E.2d
                            159 (1977).

                            Conclusion That Defendant Cannot Be Found as Basis for False Return. - The conclusion found in a return that the defendant "after a due and diligent search is not to be found," without more, if untrue, may be the basis for a finding of a false return.
                            Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 159 (1977).

                        <p>
                            A sheriff can be liable under this section for a return of criminal process which states only that a defendant "after due and diligent search is not to be found," when a jury finds, upon sufficient competent evidence, that the return is false. Rollins
                            v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 159 (1977).

                            The return of "Not to be found" on a capias, because of defendant's being out of the State at the time the return is made, is not true if the officer had an opportunity of making the arrest previously, while the process was in his hands. Martin v. Martin,

                            The $500.00 penalty is not intended to be a substitute for damages to an injured party, as this section allows the party aggrieved to bring a separate action for damages. Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>,

                            Mistake, Inadvertence and Intent Immaterial. - A return made by a sheriff that is false in fact, even though the officer was mistaken in the manner as to which he made his return, will nevertheless, subject him to the penalty for a false return. Albright
                            v. Tapscott, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 473</cite> (1862).

                        <p>
                            If a return is false in fact, the officer's inadvertence or mistake is no excuse or protection, even though no intentional deceit was practiced. Harrell v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 259</cite>, 6 S.E. 777 (1888),
                            overruled on other grounds in Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 159 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Every return untrue in fact is a false return within this section, even though the officer may be mistaken in the matter or insert the fact in his return by inadvertence. It is immaterial that the officer had no selfish purpose to subserve, or was unmoved
                            by any criminal intent. If in returning to the court his action under an execution, his return is false in its facts or any of the facts touching the things done under it, he is as well exposed to the penalty of $500.00 as
                            if the false facts were willfully and corruptly inserted. Crowder v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 180 S.E.2d 482 (1971); Rollins v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>,

                            endorsed and the return day, he was not liable for the penalty for making a false return. Hassell v. Latham, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 465</cite> (1860).

                            Where an execution was placed in sheriff's hands and levied by him on the goods of the defendant therein named; defendant in execution, at the time of the levy, demanded that his exemptions be allotted to him and paid the sheriff $2.50 in partial satisfaction
                            of the execution; and after keeping the goods several days and receiving the $2.50, the sheriff returned the execution, "Levy made; fees demanded for laying off exemptions and not paid; no further action taken", failure to
                            mention the payment of $2.50 in the return made the return defective, but did not render the sheriff liable to the penalty imposed for a false return. Harrell v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 259</cite>,

                            Where a deputy sheriff who had an order of arrest to be executed went to the house of the person named therein and, after reading to him the summons in the action, told him that he had an order of arrest for him, but after some talk, left the bond with
                            him, on his promise to call next day and fix the matter up, as the deputy did not have or attempt to have within his control in any way the party named in the order, there was no arrest, and a return of the order "Not served"
                            did not render the officer liable for a false return. State ex rel. Lawrence v. Buxton, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 129</cite>, 8 S.E. 774 (1889).

                            Where a sheriff, having in hand an order of arrest against an individual, told him that he "had better come and go with him to Jackson, and fix the matter there", but the individual refused to go with him, and the sheriff left, without taking any further
                            action, what passed did not constitute an arrest, and therefore the sheriff was not liable for a false return in returning "not served" on the order of arrest. State ex rel. Lawrence v. Buxton,

                            The correct procedure under this section to recover the penalty from a sheriff for making a false return is by civil action. Crowder v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 180 S.E.2d 482 (1971).

                            Any person may sue for the penalty imposed upon sheriffs by this section for a false return, and need not mention in his complaint the other party to whom the statute gives one half of the recovery. Harrell v. Warren,

                            Power of Court to Allow Return to Be Amended. - Where a sheriff to whom a summons issued returned it "served," and was sued for the $500.00 penalty for false return provided for by this section, the court properly permitted him, for proper reasons set
                            out in his affidavit, to amend this return. Swain v. Burden, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 16</cite>, 32 S.E. 319 (1899); Swain v. Phelps, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 43</cite>, 34 S.E. 110 (1899).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The court has the discretionary power, in proper cases, to allow a sheriff to amend his return of process to speak the truth, even though the amendment will defeat the penalty for a false return. Crowder v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite>                            57, 180 S.E.2d 482 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A sheriff may move to amend his return of process so as to make it speak the truth even after suit has been brought for the penalty imposed for a false return, even though the amendment defeats plaintiff's right to recover such penalty. However, the sheriff
                            does not as a matter of law have the right to amend his return in order to correct his error, but it is within the discretion of the presiding judge to allow such amendments in meritorious cases. Rollins v. Gibson,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">293 N.C. 73</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 159 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Amendment of Return Held Improper. - It was not proper for the trial judge to permit defendants to amend return during course of trial where plaintiff alleged and defendants admitted that the return had been marked "served by delivering a copy thereof
                            to this plaintiff" but that the sheriff "did not serve the original order of court upon the plaintiff," and where the parties stipulated at a pretrial conference that the return showing "that it was delivered to the plaintiff
                            was not correct." Crowder v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 180 S.E.2d 482 (1971).

                        <p>
                            Time For Appeal Where Return Amended. - When, in an action against a sheriff for a false return, the court permits such return to be amended, the plaintiff should note his exception and, unless the amended return is admitted to be true, proceed to try
                            the issue. An appeal before final judgment on such admission or a verdict is premature and will be dismissed. Piedmont Mfg. Co. v. Buxton, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 74</cite>, 11 S.E. 264 (1890).

                        <p>
                            When the falsity of the return was alleged and not controverted, the issue of the truth or falsity of the return was removed from the case. Crowder v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 57, 180 S.E.2d 482 (1971).

                        Amercement as Remedy for Failure to Make Due Return. - Amercement, and not a civil action, is the remedy given against a sheriff for not making "due and proper" return of process. Piedmont Mfg. Co. v. Buxton, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 74</cite>,

        Service By Deputy Sheriffs in an Action Against Deputy.
       </b> - Where a deputy is sued for actions within the alleged scope of his duties for which the Sheriff himself may be held liable, the Sheriff clearly has an interest in the litigation, and is barred from serving process;
                        similarly, because the Sheriff's deputies act as his agents, they cannot serve process on anyone in a case in which the Sheriff is an interested party. Goodwin v. Furr, 25 F. Supp. 2d 713 (M.D.N.C. 1998).

                        Residents failed to comply with G.S. 162-16, and therefore a sheriff and deputy were never properly served with summons, where another deputy served both the sheriff and the deputy; such service was improper since the clerk of court never designated that

                <p>
                    When the sheriff of any county has good reason to believe that the jail of his county is in danger of being broken or entered for the purpose of killing or injuring a prisoner placed by the law in his custody, it shall be his duty at once to call on the
                    commissioners of the county, or some one of them, for a sufficient guard for the jail, and in such case, if the commissioner or commissioners fail to authorize the employment of necessary guards to protect the jail, and by reason of
                    such failure the jail is entered and a prisoner killed, the county in whose jail the prisoner is confined shall be responsible in damages, to be recovered by the personal representatives of the prisoner thus killed, by action begun
                    and prosecuted before the superior court of any county in this State.

                        Office Cannot Be Subject of Bargain and Sale. - The public has an interest in the proper performance of their duties by public officers, and would be prejudiced by agreements tending to impair an officer's efficiency or in any way to interfere with or
                        disturb the due execution of the duties of the office. The office of sheriff and tax collector is one of public confidence and fidelity to a public trust, and cannot be a matter of bargain and sale. It requires good faith and duty.

                        Deputy Sheriffs. - In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is not a county employee.
                        Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

                        Termination of Deputy Sheriff. - Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be lawfully
                        terminated for political reasons under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary to ensure
                        that the sheriff's policies are carried out. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).
