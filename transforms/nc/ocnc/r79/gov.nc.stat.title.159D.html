       The General Assembly finds and determines that there exists in the State a critical condition of unemployment and a scarcity of employment opportunities; that the economic insecurity which results from such unemployment and scarcity of employment opportunities constitutes a serious menace to the safety, morals and general welfare of the entire State; that such unemployment and scarcity of employment opportunities have caused many workers and their families, including young adults upon whom future economic prosperity is dependent, to migrate elsewhere to find employment and establish homes; that such emigration has resulted in a reduced rate of growth in the tax base of the counties and other local governmental units of the State which impairs the financial ability of such counties and other local governmental units to support education and other local governmental services; that such unemployment results in obligations to grant public assistance and to pay unemployment compensation; that the aforesaid conditions can best be remedied by the attraction, stimulation, expansion and rehabilitation and revitalization of industrial and manufacturing facilities for industry in the State; and that there is a need to stimulate a larger flow of private investment funds into industrial building programs in the State.

       The General Assembly further finds and determines that the development and expansion of industry within the State, which are essential to the economic growth of the State, and to the full employment and prosperity of its people, are accompanied by the increased production and discharge of gaseous, liquid, and solid pollution and wastes which threaten and endanger the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants of the State by polluting the air, land and waters of the State; that in order to reduce, control, and prevent such environmental pollution, it is imperative that action be taken at various levels of government to require the provision of devices, equipment and facilities for the collection, reduction, treatment, and disposal of such pollution and wastes; that the assistance provided in this Article, especially with respect to financing, is therefore in the public interest and serves a public purpose of the State in promoting the health, welfare and safety of the inhabitants of the State not only physically by collecting, reducing, treating and preventing environmental pollution but also economically by securing and retaining private industry thereby maintaining a higher level of employment and economic activity and stability.

       The agency is authorized to provide for the issuance, at one time or from time to time, of bonds of the agency for the purpose of paying all or any part of the cost of any project. The principal of, the interest on and any premium payable under the redemption of such bonds shall be payable solely from the funds herein authorized for such payment. The bonds of each issue shall bear interest as may be determined by the Local Government Commission of North Carolina with the approval of the agency and the obligor irrespective of the limitations of G.S. 24-1.1, as amended, and successor provisions. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall mature at such time or times not exceeding 30 years from the date of their issuance, and may be made redeemable before maturity at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, as may be fixed by the agency prior to the issuance of the bonds. The agency shall determine the form and the manner of execution of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment of principal and interest. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose signature appears on any bonds or coupons ceases to be that officer before the delivery of the bonds, the signature or the facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until such delivery. The agency may also provide for the authentication of the bonds by a trustee or fiscal agent.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da01s159D-6ol1b">
       The proceeds of the bonds of each issue shall be used solely for the payment of the cost of the project or projects, or a portion thereof, for which the bonds were issued, and shall be disbursed in such manner and under such restrictions, if any, as the agency may provide in the financing agreement and the security document. If the proceeds of the bonds of any issue, by reason of increased construction costs or error in estimates or otherwise, are less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of such deficiency.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da01s159D-6ol1c">
       The proceeds of bonds issued pursuant to this Article shall not be used to refinance the cost of a project. For the purposes of this section, a cost of a project is considered refinanced if both of the following conditions are met:
       <ol>
        <li id="t159Da01s159D-6ol1c1">
         The cost is initially paid from sources other than bond proceeds, and the original expenditure is to be reimbursed from bond proceeds.
        </li>
        <li id="t159Da01s159D-6ol1c2">
         The original expenditure was paid more than 60 days before the agency took some action indicating its intent that the expenditure would be financed or reimbursed from bond proceeds.

      </li>
      <li id="t159Da01s159D-6ol1d">
       Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, preliminary expenditures that are incurred prior to the commencement of the acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation of a project, such as architectural costs, engineering costs, surveying costs, soil testing costs, bond issuance costs, and other similar costs, may be reimbursed from bond proceeds even if these costs are incurred or paid more than 60 days prior to the agency's action. This exception that allows preliminary expenditures to be reimbursed from bond proceeds, whether or not they are incurred or paid within 60 days of the agency's action, does not include costs that are incurred incident to the commencement of the construction of a project, such as expenditures for land acquisition and site preparation. In any event, an expenditure originally paid before the agency took some action indicating its intent that the expenditures would be financed or reimbursed from bond proceeds may be reimbursed from bond proceeds only if the agency finds that reimbursing those costs from bond proceeds will promote the purposes of this Article.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da01s159D-6ol1e">
       Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this Article without obtaining, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Article, the consent of the State or of any political subdivision and without any other proceedings or the happening of any conditions or things other than those proceedings, conditions or things specifically required by this Article and the provisions of the financing agreement and security document authorizing the issuance of such bonds and securing the same.

   - Session Laws 2002-172, s. 5.1, provides: "The General Assembly finds that there are small manufacturing companies in the State that are eligible for industrial development bond financing for capital improvements and expansions, but are not able to take advantage of that financing because of the administrative costs involved. This problem can be addressed by reviving the composite bond program under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 159D</a></cite> of the General Statutes, under which the North Carolina Capital Facilities Finance Agency could combine several series of bonds into a single bond offering, thereby reducing transaction costs and permitting eligible small manufacturers to access tax exempt financing for capital investments. The composite bond program would be facilitated by the changes proposed to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 159D</a></cite> in this part [Part 5 of Session Laws 2002-172] that will streamline the procedures for composite issues by requiring only one public hearing and align the review standard for bonds issued as part of a composite bond program with the standard for bonds issued by county industrial development projects."
     </p>

      Session Laws 2004-132, s. 3, provides: "The Department of Commerce shall encourage projects applying for industrial revenue bonds under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 159C</a></cite> or <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 159D</a></cite> of the General Statutes to locate the projects in development zones."

      It is declared that for the benefit of the people of the State of North Carolina, the increase of their commerce, welfare and prosperity and the improvement of their health and living conditions it is essential that they be given the fullest opportunity to learn and to develop their intellectual capacities; that it is essential for institutions for higher education and institutions for elementary and secondary education within the State to be able to construct and renovate facilities to assist its citizens in achieving the fullest development of their intellectual capacities; and that it is the purpose of this Article to provide a measure of assistance and an alternative method to enable private institutions for higher education and institutions for elementary and secondary education in the State to provide the facilities and the structures that are needed to accomplish the purposes of this Article, all to the public benefit and good, to the extent and in the manner provided in this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is further declared that this purpose will benefit the people as a way to improve student learning, increase learning opportunities for all students, encourage the use of different and innovative teaching methods, create new professional opportunities for teachers, provide parents and students with expanded choices in the types of educational opportunities that are available, and lower the overall cost of education to the State and to parents and students.
     </p>
     <p>
      The General Assembly also finds that the private sector often provides services and opportunities to the people of the State of North Carolina in activities that constitute a public purpose, and that these activities by the private sector are to be fostered and encouraged. The people of the State of North Carolina will benefit from the enactment of laws and creation of programs that assist the private sector in obtaining financing for capital improvements of facilities that will be used in conducting these activities.

      <li id="t159Da02s159D-38ol1a">
       There is created a body politic and corporate to be known as "North Carolina Capital Facilities Finance Agency" which shall be constituted a public agency and an instrumentality of the State for the performance of essential public functions. The agency shall be governed by a board of directors composed of seven members. Two of the members of the board shall be the State Treasurer and the State Auditor, both of whom shall serve ex officio. The remaining directors of the agency shall be residents of the State and shall not hold other public office. The General Assembly upon the recommendation of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate shall appoint one director in accordance with G.S. 120-121, the General Assembly upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall appoint one director in accordance with G.S. 120-121, and the Governor shall appoint three directors of the agency. The five appointive directors of the agency shall be appointed for staggered four-year terms, two being appointed initially for one year by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, respectively, and one for two years, one for three years and one for four years, respectively, as designated by the Governor. Each director shall continue in office until a successor is duly appointed and qualified, except that any person appointed to fill a vacancy shall serve only for the unexpired term. Any vacancy in a position held by an appointive member shall be filled by a new appointment made by the officer who originally made the appointment. Any member of the board of directors is eligible for reappointment. Each appointive member of the board of directors may be removed by the Governor for misfeasance, malfeasance or neglect of duty after reasonable notice and a public hearing, unless the notice and hearing are in writing expressly waived. Each appointive member of the board of directors shall take an oath of office to administer the duties of office faithfully and impartially and a record of the oath shall be filed in the office of the Secretary of State. The Governor shall designate from among the members of the board of directors a chair and a vice-chair, whose terms extend to the earlier of either two years or the date of expiration of their then current terms as members of the board of directors of the agency. The board of directors shall elect and appoint and prescribe the duties of a secretary-treasurer and any other officers it considers necessary or advisable, which officers need not be members of the board of directors.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da02s159D-38ol1b">
       No part of the revenues or assets of the agency shall inure to the benefit of or be distributable to its members or officers or other private persons. The members of the agency shall receive no compensation for their services but shall be entitled to receive, for attendance at meetings of the agency or any committee thereof and for other services for the agency, reimbursement for such actual expenses as may be incurred for travel and subsistence in the performance of official duties and such per diem as is allowed by law for members of other State boards, commissions and committees.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da02s159D-38ol1c">
       The secretary-treasurer of the agency shall keep a record of the proceedings of the agency and shall be custodian of all books, documents and papers filed with the agency, the minute book or journal of the agency and its official seal. The secretary-treasurer shall have authority to cause copies to be made of all minutes and other records and documents of the agency and to give certificates under the official seal of the agency to the effect that such copies are true copies, and all persons dealing with the agency may rely upon such certificates.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da02s159D-38ol1d">
       Four members of the board of directors of the agency shall constitute a quorum and the affirmative vote of a majority of the members present at a meeting of the board of directors duly called and held shall be necessary for any action taken by the board of directors of the agency. The board of directors may, however, appoint an executive committee to act on behalf of the board during the period between regular meetings of said board, and said committee shall have full power to act upon the vote of a majority of its members. No vacancy in the membership of the agency impairs the rights of a quorum to exercise all the rights and to perform all the duties of the agency.
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da02s159D-38ol1e">
       The North Carolina Capital Facilities Finance Agency shall be contained within the Department of State Treasurer as if it had been transferred to that department by a Type II transfer as defined in G.S. 143A-6(b).
      </li>
      <li id="t159Da02s159D-38ol1f">
       An individual serving on the board of directors for the agency shall be immune individually from civil liability for monetary damages, except to the extent covered by insurance, for any act or failure to act arising out of that service, except where any of the following apply:
       <ol>
        <li id="t159Da02s159D-38ol1f1">

It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company incorporated under the laws of the State which may act as depositary of the proceeds of bonds or notes, revenues or other money hereunder to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the agency. Any such trust agreement or resolution may set off the rights and remedies, including foreclosure of any deed of trust or mortgage, of the holders of any bonds or notes and of the trustee, and may restrict the individual right of action by any such holders. In addition to the foregoing, any such trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the agency considers reasonable and proper for the security of the holders of any bonds or notes. Expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of such trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of any project or paid from the revenues pledged or assigned to the payment of the principal of and the interest on bonds or notes or from any other funds available to the agency.
