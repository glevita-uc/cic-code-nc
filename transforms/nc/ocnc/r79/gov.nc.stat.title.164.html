      Editor's Note.
   
   - It appears that this Article was originally enacted as part of Session Laws 1943, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.033.html" target="_blank">Chapter 33</a></cite>, which was not printed as part of the Session Laws but was in a separate bound volume in the Secretary of State's office. However, the Secretary of State's office no longer has such a volume in its possession. The volume may have burned in a warehouse fire that destroyed some records. The sections first appear in "The North Carolina Code of 1943 - Legislative Edition," the report of the Legislative Commission on Recodification. As the origin of Article 1 is not completely certain, Session Laws 1943, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.033.html" target="_blank">Chapter 33</a></cite> is not listed in the historical citations for the sections in Article 1.

      The Division of Legislative Drafting and Codification of Statutes of the State Department of Justice, under the direction and supervision of the Attorney General, shall complete and perfect the General Statutes, as enacted by the General Assembly of 1943, by changing all references therein to the "Code," "North Carolina Code," "Code of 1943" or "North Carolina Code of 1943" to read "General Statutes," and by causing to be inserted therein all such general public statutes as may be enacted at the 1943 Session of the General Assembly and all amendments, in their proper places in sections under the appropriate chapter and subdivisions of chapters, and by deleting all sections or portions of sections found to be expressly repealed, or found to be repealed by virtue of the repeal of any cognate sections or parts of sections of the Consolidated Statutes or session laws, and by deleting repealed provisions and substituting in lieu thereof all proper amendments of the General Statutes or of cognate sections of the Consolidated Statutes or session laws; and the Division is hereby authorized to change the number of sections and chapters, transfer sections, chapters and subdivisions of chapters and make such other corrections which do not change the law, as may be found by the Division necessary in making an accurate, clear, and orderly statement of said laws. After the completion of such codification of the general and public laws of 1943, such laws, as they appear in the printed volumes of the General Statutes, shall be deemed an accurate codification of the statutes of 1943 contained therein.

      - Session Laws 2008-211, enacted improvements to the rules on the management of stormwater in the coastal counties in order to protect water quality, which superceded the former rules. The act is noted in full under G.S. 143-214.7.
   Session Laws 2008-211, s. 7, provides: "Provisions of Act Not Codified; Set Out As Note. - Notwithstanding G.S. 164-10, the Revisor of Statutes shall not codify any of the provisions of this act. The Revisor of Statutes shall set out the text of this act as a note to G.S. 143-214.7 and may make notes concerning this act to other sections of the General Statutes as the Revisor of Statutes deems appropriate."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-97, s. 12, provides: "All contractual rights and duties of the State of North Carolina, acting through its Attorney General and the Division of Legislative Drafting and Codification of Statutes of the North Carolina Department of Justice under G.S. 164-10, shall remain unchanged but shall be executed by the Legislative Services Office. Nothing in this act shall affect any currently existing agreed upon discount for printed materials to be provided by a vendor to the North Carolina Department of Justice."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-392, s. 10, provides: "The Revisor of Statutes is authorized to alphabetize, number, and renumber the special registration plates listed in G.S. 20-79.4 to ensure that all the special registration plates are listed in alphabetical order and numbered accordingly."

      For the text of sections 2 and 3 of the Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission Act of 1990, Session Laws 1989 (Reg. Sess., 1990), see c. 1076, ss. 2 and 3.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2004-186, s. 12.1, provides: "The General Assembly finds that the North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission has adopted formal criteria for classifying felony offenses. The Sentencing Commission has identified three general types of harms: harms to persons (including both physical and mental injury); harms to property; and harms to society. The degrees of harm are divided into three levels:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Injury to person, property, or society;
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Significant injury to person, property, or society; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Serious injury to person, property, or society. The stated purpose of establishing the criteria was 'to create a rational and consistent philosophical basis for classifying offenses; to assure proportionality in severity; and to provide a guidepost for classifying new crimes in the future.'
     </p>
     <p>
      "In contrast to the felony classification criteria, the Commission did not create classification criteria for misdemeanors. However, the current misdemeanor sentencing laws include an assault offense that has serious injury as an element - even though 'serious injury to a person' is a category of harm for felony offense classification. The General Assembly finds that the classification of assault offenses that involve serious injury as misdemeanors is inconsistent with the Sentencing Commission's classification of felonies based on harm.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission, pursuant to its statutory responsibilities under Article 4 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.164.html" target="_blank">Chapter 164</a></cite> of the General Statutes, shall study the classification of misdemeanor offenses. In particular, the Commission shall examine the classification of assault offenses in relation to property offenses, crimes against society, and felony assault offenses. The Commission shall develop a system for classifying misdemeanor offenses on the basis of their severity. The Commission may consider reclassifying existing offenses and creating new offenses in order to insure proportionality and consistency. The Commission shall report its findings and recommendations to the 2005 General Assembly, 2005 Regular Session. The report shall describe the status of the Commission's work and shall include any completed policy recommendations and proposed legislation. The Commission shall make a final report to the 2005 General Assembly, 2006 Regular Session."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2010-31, s. 19.5, provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly that there be only three misdemeanor punishment levels: Class A1, Class 1, and Class 2.
   The North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission, in consultation with the Conference of District Attorneys, the Office of Indigent Defense Services, and the School of Government, shall review all Class 3 misdemeanor offenses and provide recommendations to the 2011 General Assembly for reclassifying each Class 3 misdemeanor as either an infraction or a Class 2 misdemeanor. The Commission may, in its discretion, consider other misdemeanor offenses for reclassification as infractions."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2010-31, s. 1.1, provides: "This act shall be known as the 'Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act of 2010'."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2010-31, s. 32.3, provides: "Except for statutory changes or other provisions that clearly indicate an intention to have effects beyond the 2010-2011 fiscal year, the textual provisions of this act apply only to funds appropriated for, and activities occurring during, the 2010-2011 fiscal year."
