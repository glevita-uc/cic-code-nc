        CASE NOTES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This Chapter did not purport to abrogate long established principles
   
   under which equitable liens have been enforced by our courts in a variety of situations. Embree Constr. Group, Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 388 S.E.2d 604 (1990), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 487</cite>, 411 S.E.2d 916 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Priority of Liens.
   
   - For priority purposes, liens duly perfected under this Chapter relate back to the time of first furnishing labor or materials. As between a statutory lien and the lien created by a deed of trust, the general rule is that the lien which is first in time has priority. RDC, Inc. v. Brookleigh Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 299 S.E.2d 448, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 182</cite>, 305 S.E.2d 722 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant properly met the requirements of this chapter, and judgment signed by trial judge properly referred to the site upon which defendant wanted a lien declared and related the lien back to the date when labor and materials were first furnished at the site; therefore, defendant's lien had priority over the deed of trust held by plaintiff. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Rowell, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 444 S.E.2d 231, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 518</cite>, 452 S.E.2d 813 (1994).

        Preservation for Review.
       </b>
       - In a case in which a bankruptcy court awarded a debtor damages and attorney's fees for conversion by a creditor and the creditor argued on appeal that even if the layaway plan became an installment sales contract, he nevertheless obtained a possessory lien on the sewing/embroidery machine for repairs pursuant to G.S. 44A-1 et seq., which, he contended, authorized his retention of the machine until the debtor paid for repairs, he had not raised that argument in the bankruptcy court, and the district court could not consider the argument because there was no showing of exceptional circumstances. Hancock v. Renshaw, 421 B.R. 738 (M.D.N.C. 2009).

       Any person engaged in the business of operating a hotel, motel, or boardinghouse has a lien upon all baggage, vehicles and other personal property brought upon his premises by a guest or boarder who is an owner thereof to the extent of reasonable charges for the room, accommodations and other items or services furnished at the request of the guest or boarder. This lien shall not have priority over any security interest in the property which is perfected at the time the guest or boarder brings the property to said hotel, motel or boardinghouse.

       Any person who repairs, services, tows, or stores motor vehicles in the ordinary course of the person's business pursuant to an express or implied contract with an owner or legal possessor of the motor vehicle, except for a motor vehicle seized pursuant to G.S. 20-28.3, has a lien upon the motor vehicle for reasonable charges for such repairs, servicing, towing, storing, or for the rental of one or more substitute vehicles provided during the repair, servicing, or storage. This lien shall have priority over perfected and unperfected security interests.

       Any lessor of nonresidential demised premises has a lien on all furniture, furnishings, trade fixtures, equipment and other personal property to which the tenant has legal title and which remains on the demised premises if (i) the tenant has vacated the premises for 21 or more days after the paid rental period has expired, and (ii) the lessor has a lawful claim for damages against the tenant. If the tenant has vacated the premises for 21 or more days after the expiration of the paid rental period, or if the lessor has received a judgment for possession of the premises which is executable and the tenant has vacated the premises, then all property remaining on the premises may be removed and placed in storage. If the total value of all property remaining on the premises is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), then it shall be deemed abandoned five days after the tenant has vacated the premises, and the lessor may remove it and may donate it to any charitable institution or organization. Provided, the lessor shall not have a lien if there is an agreement between the lessor or his agent and the tenant that the lessor shall not have a lien. This lien shall be for the amount of any rents which were due the lessor at the time the tenant vacated the premises and for the time, up to 60 days, from the vacating of the premises to the date of sale; and for any sums necessary to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant, normal wear and tear excepted; and for reasonable costs and expenses of sale. The lien created by this subsection shall be enforced by sale at public sale pursuant to the provisions of G.S. 44A-4(e). This lien shall not have priority over any security interest in the property which is perfected at the time the lessor acquires this lien.

       Any lessor of a space for a manufactured home as defined in G.S. 143-143.9(6) has a lien on all furniture, furnishings, and other personal property including the manufactured home titled in the name of the tenant if (i) the manufactured home remains on the demised premises 21 days after the lessor is placed in lawful possession by writ of possession and (ii) the lessor has a lawful claim for damages against the tenant. If the lessor has received a judgment for possession of the premises which has been executed, then all property remaining on the premises may be removed and placed in storage. Prior to the expiration of the 21-day period, the landlord shall release possession of the personal property and manufactured home to the tenant during regular business hours or at a time mutually agreed upon. This lien shall be for the amount of any rents which were due the lessor at the time the tenant vacated the premises and for the time, up to 60 days, from the vacating of the premises to the date of sale; and for any sums necessary to repair damages to the premises caused by the tenant, normal wear and tear excepted; and for reasonable costs and expenses of the sale. The lien created by this subsection shall be enforced by public sale under G.S. 44A-4(e). The landlord may begin the advertisement for sale process immediately upon execution of the writ of possession by the sheriff, but may not conduct the sale until the lien has attached. This lien shall not have any priority over any security interest in the property that is perfected at the time the lessor acquires this lien. The lessor shall not have a lien under this subsection if there is an agreement between the lessor or the lessor's agent and the tenant that the lessor shall not have a lien.

       Any person who improves any textile goods in the ordinary course of his business pursuant to an express or implied contract with the owner or legal possessor of such goods shall have a lien upon all goods of such owner or possessor in his possession for improvement. The amount of such lien shall be for the entire unpaid contracted charges owed such person for improvement of said goods including any amount owed for improvement of goods, the possession of which may have been relinquished, and such lien shall have priority over perfected and unperfected security interests. "Goods" as used herein includes any textile goods, yarns or products of natural or man-made fibers or combination thereof.

       Any person who fabricates, casts, or otherwise makes a mold or who uses a mold to manufacture, assemble, or otherwise make a product pursuant to an express or implied contract with the owner of such mold shall have a lien upon the mold. For a lien to arise under this subsection, there must exist written evidence that the parties understood that a lien could be applied against the mold, with the evidence being in the form either of a written contract or a separate written statement provided by the potential holder of the lien under this subsection to the owner of the mold prior to the fabrication or use of the mold. The written contract or separate written statement must describe generally the amount of the potential lien as set forth in this subsection. The amount of the lien under this subsection shall equal the total of (i) any unpaid contracted charges due from the owner of the mold for making the mold, plus (ii) any unpaid contracted charges for all products made with the mold. The lien under this subsection shall not have priority over any security interest in the mold which is perfected at the time the person acquires this lien.

The Division of Motor Vehicles shall issue notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the person having legal title to the property, if reasonably ascertainable, to the person with whom the lienor dealt if different, and to each secured party and other person claiming an interest in the property who is actually known to the Division or who can be reasonably ascertained. The notice shall state that a lien has been asserted against specific property and shall identify the lienor, the date that the lien arose, the general nature of the services performed and materials used or sold for which the lien is asserted, the amount of the lien, and that the lienor intends to sell the property in satisfaction of the lien. The notice shall inform the recipient that the recipient has the right to a judicial hearing at which time a determination will be made as to the validity of the lien prior to a sale taking place. The notice shall further state that the recipient has a period of 10 days from the date of receipt in which to notify the Division by certified mail, return receipt requested, that a hearing is desired and that if the recipient wishes to contest the sale of his property pursuant to such lien, the recipient should notify the Division that a hearing is desired.

The Division shall notify the lienor whether such notice is timely received by the Division. In lieu of the notice by the lienor to the Division and the notices issued by the Division described above, the lienor may issue notice on a form approved by the Division pursuant to the notice requirements above. If notice is issued by the lienor, the recipient shall return the form requesting a hearing to the lienor, and not the Division, within 10 days from the date the recipient receives the notice if a judicial hearing is requested. If the certified mail notice has been returned as undeliverable and the notice of a right to a judicial hearing has been given to the owner of the motor vehicle in accordance with G.S. 20-28.4, no further notice is required. Failure of the recipient to notify the Division or lienor, as specified in the notice, within 10 days of the receipt of such notice that a hearing is desired shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing prior to the sale of the property against which the lien is asserted, and the lienor may proceed to enforce the lien by public or private sale as provided in this section and the Division shall transfer title to the property pursuant to such sale. If the Division or lienor, as specified in the notice, is notified within the 10-day period provided above that a hearing is desired prior to sale, the lien may be enforced by sale as provided in this section and the Division will transfer title only pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Failure of the recipient to notify the lienor within 10 days of the receipt of such notice that a hearing is desired shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing prior to sale of the property against which the lien is asserted and the lienor may proceed to enforce the lien by public or private sale as provided in this section. If the lienor is notified within the 10-day period provided above that a hearing is desired prior to sale, the lien may be enforced by sale as provided in this section only pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

       Private Sale. - Sale by private sale may be made in any manner that is commercially reasonable. If the property upon which the lien is claimed is a motor vehicle, the sale may not be made until notice is given to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles pursuant to G.S. 20-114(c). Not less than 30 days prior to the date of the proposed private sale, the lienor shall cause notice to be mailed, as provided in subsection (f) hereof, to the person having legal title to the property, if reasonably ascertainable, to the person with whom the lienor dealt if different, and to each secured party or other person claiming an interest in the property who is actually known to the lienor or can be reasonably ascertained.

The request for immediate possession may be made in the complaint, which shall also set forth the amount of the asserted lien and the portion thereof which is not in dispute, if any. If within three days after service of the summons and complaint, as the number of days is computed in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 6, the lienor does not file a contrary statement of the amount of the lien at the time of the filing of the complaint, the amount set forth in the complaint shall be deemed to be the amount of the asserted lien. The clerk may at any time disburse to the lienor that portion of the cash bond, which the plaintiff says in his complaint is not in dispute, upon application of the lienor. The magistrate or judge shall direct appropriate disbursement of the disputed or undisbursed portion of the bond in the judgment of the court. In the event an action by the owner pursuant to this section is heard in district or superior court, the substantially prevailing party in such court may be awarded a reasonable attorney's fee in the discretion of the judge.

      If the certified mail notice has been returned as undeliverable, or if the name of the person having legal title to the vehicle cannot reasonably be ascertained and the fair market value of the vehicle is less than eight hundred dollars ($800.00), the lienor may institute a special proceeding in the county where the vehicle is being held, for authorization to sell that vehicle. Market value shall be determined by the schedule of values adopted by the Commissioner under G.S. 105-187.3.
     </p>
     <p>
      In such a proceeding a lienor may not include more than ten vehicles, but the proceeds of the sale of each shall be subject only to valid claims against that vehicle, and any excess proceeds of the sale shall be paid immediately to the Treasurer for disposition pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.116B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 116B</a></cite> of the General Statutes.
     </p>
     <p>
      The application to the clerk in such a special proceeding shall contain the notice of sale information set out in subsection (f) hereof. If the application is in proper form the clerk shall enter an order authorizing the sale on a date not less than 14 days therefrom, and the lienor shall cause the application and order to be sent immediately by first-class mail pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 5, to each person to whom notice was mailed pursuant to this subsection. Following the authorized sale the lienor shall file with the clerk a report in the form of an affidavit, stating that the lienor has complied with the public or private sale provisions of G.S. 44A-4, the name, address, and bid of the high bidder or person buying at a private sale, and a statement of the disposition of the sale proceeds. The clerk then shall enter an order directing the Division to transfer title accordingly.

      and shall publish notice of sale once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the same county, the date of the last publication being not less than five days prior to the sale. The notice of sale need not be published if the vehicle has a market value of less than three thousand five hundred dollars ($3,500), as determined by the schedule of values adopted by the Commissioner under G.S. 105-187.3.

       <b>
        Former Provisions as to Sale Unconstitutional.
       </b>
       - The sale provision of this section as it stood before the 1975 amendment permitted the sale of motor vehicles by a lienor without affording the owner an opportunity for notice and a hearing to judicially determine the validity of the underlying debt, and in this respect the statute violated the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Caesar v. Kiser, 387 F. Supp. 645 (M.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        "State Action" Involved.
       </b>
       - The State is actively involved in the creation and enforcement of the lien on motor vehicles and such must be held to constitute "state action" as that term is used in 42 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">

       1983. Caesar v. Kiser, 387 F. Supp. 645 (M.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under North Carolina law, the sale could not be accomplished without the affirmative acts of the Department (now Division) of Motor Vehicles in transferring the indicia of ownership. Caesar v. Kiser, 387 F. Supp. 645 (M.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lienor Must Comply with Section when Mail Notice Undeliverable.
   
   - Subdivision (b)(1) of this section did not allow a lienor of an abandoned motor vehicle to dispose of it without complying with the requirements of this section as they pertain to other types of personal property when the registered or certified mail notice had been returned as undeliverable. Ernie's Tire Sales &amp; Serv. v. Riggs, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 417 S.E.2d 75 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Lienor May Not Sell Vehicle Without Prior Judicial Determination or Owner's Waiver.
       </b>
       - The lienor may still retain his possessory lien on the motor vehicle if the owner or legal possessor fails to pay his charges, but the lienor may not, without a prior judicial determination or the owner's waiver, sell the motor vehicle to satisfy his claim. Caesar v. Kiser, 387 F. Supp. 645 (M.D.N.C. 1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Amount Designated in Complaint Established Amount of Lien.
   
   - Under the plain language of this section, where the lien amount was designated as $100.00 in plaintiff's complaint and that allegation was not challenged in the statutorily specified manner, the amount of the lien was conclusively established as being $100.00. Thus, regardless of any labels attached to the various parties herein, the clerk of court did not err in ordering defendant to relinquish possession of transformer upon plaintiff's tender of $100.00. Peace River Elec. Coop. v. Ward Transformer Co., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 449 S.E.2d 202 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 739</cite>, 454 S.E.2d 655 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Time for Collection by Lienholder.
   
   - In view of the proviso of subsection (a) of this section, which states that when property is placed in storage pursuant to an express contract of storage, the lien shall continue and the lienor may bring an action to collect storage charges and enforce his lien at any time within 120 days following default on the obligation to pay storage charges, and in view of the fact that storage was under an express contract with the sheriff, subject to the control of court, lienholder's right to collect did not end 180 days after storage began, but 120 days after the default, if any, occurred. Case v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 729, 315 S.E.2d 737 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Applicability of Bond Provision.
       </b>
       - The bond provision is located only in the second paragraph of subsection (a), the paragraph governing lien actions filed by the owner of property subject to a lien; accordingly, the bond provision applies only to lien actions filed by the owner of property subject to a lien, not to lien actions filed by the lienor. Griffin v. Holmes, 843 F. Supp. 81 (E.D.N.C. 1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 44A-4(b)(2) provides that the lienor has to issue notice to the person having legal title to property
   
   and specifies what the notice should contain; where defendant failed to comply substantially with the provisions of that subdivision, defendant was liable for statutory and actual damages. Rowell v. N.C. Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 431, 552 S.E.2d 274 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary Judgment Improper.
   
   - Summary judgment for defendant on its claim that plaintiff violated G.S. 44A-4 was error because, although the evidence raised an inference that plaintiff failed to comply with G.S. 44A-4, this was a factual issue to have been determined only by the jury. Vaseleniuck Engine Dev., LLC v. Sabertooth Motorcycles, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 540, 727 S.E.2d 308 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Calculation of Damages.
   
   - Determination of actual damages, if any, was reserved for the jury, and the measure of actual damages was the difference between the fair market value of the property at the time of the sale and the amount for which the property was actually sold. Rowell v. N.C. Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 431, 552 S.E.2d 274 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Attorney Fees.
   
   - Where defendant neither prevailed nor defended under the theory that he had a chapter 44A lien, but it was a warehouseman's lien under chapter 25, the trial court erred by awarding attorney fees under this section. Smithers v. Tru-Pak Moving Sys., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 468 S.E.2d 410 (1996).

       Where purchaser of personal property subject to a valid, enforceable, perfected security interest buys in the collateral
   
   at a foreclosure sale conducted pursuant to this chapter to satisfy an account for repairs which the purchaser has failed to pay for a purchase price which essentially represents payment of the account, the purchaser does not thereby extinguish the security interest; rather, the security property or collateral remains subject to the security interest, and if the indebtedness for payment of which the collateral was pledged remains in default, the right to possession continues to be with the holder of the security interest.

       When the lienor involuntarily relinquishes possession of the property and the property upon which the lien is claimed is a motor vehicle or vessel, the lienor may institute an action to regain possession of the motor vehicle or vessel in small claims court any time following the lienor's involuntary loss of possession and following maturity of the obligation to pay charges. The lienor shall serve a copy of the summons and the complaint pursuant to G.S. 1A-1, Rule 4, on each secured party claiming an interest in the vehicle or vessel. For purposes of this section, involuntary relinquishment of possession includes only those situations where the owner or other party takes possession of the motor vehicle or vessel without the lienor's permission or without judicial process. If in the court action the owner or other party retains possession of the motor vehicle or vessel, the owner or other party shall pay the amount of the lien asserted as bond into the clerk of the court in which the action is pending.

The clerk may at any time disburse to the lienor that portion of the cash bond which is not in dispute, upon application of the lienor. The magistrate shall:

       Mechanic's Lien Survived Credit Union's Repossession of a Car
   
   - While a mechanic who performed a diagnostic analysis of an automobile had a valid lien against the credit union that financed the purchase of the automobile and repossessed the automobile from the mechanic's premises late at night without the mechanic's knowledge or consent, the trial court erred in awarding the mechanic actual and treble damages, as the mechanic's proper remedy was to be awarded possession of the automobile.

       "Improvements."
   
   - Where contractors who performed labor or furnished materials for improvements at <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> debtor's facility asserted statutory liens against certain machinery and equipment at the facility, the contractors were not entitled to liens because the machinery and equipment, which were intended to remain personal property and could, despite their size and weight, be removed, did not constitute improvements on real property within the meaning of G.S. 44A-7(2) and did not constitute improvements on real property for purposes of G.S. 44A-8. All Points Capital Corp. v. Laurel Hill Paper Co. (In re Laurel Hill Paper Co.), 393 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008), appeal dismissed, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6875 (M.D.N.C. 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff's work preparing a report for a developer went toward making an improvement to the land as required by G.S. 44A-8 as the work constituted an improvement under G.S. 44A-7, and defendants' claim that the work was done under a separate contract was rejected.

       "Owner."
   
   - Contractors' mechanics' lien complaint alleging a bank took the subject property at a foreclosure sale subject to the lien was properly dismissed because the contractors had no right to file a lien, as (1) no G.S. 44A-12 claim of lien or G.S. 44A-17 et seq. notice of claim of lien was alleged, and (2) the contractors had no lien against the bank's predecessor, as the predecessor had no interest in the property when the contractors first furnished materials, so the contractors did not contract with the G.S. 44A-8 "owner" of the property.

       Binding Findings of Fact.
   
   - For purposes of G.S. 44A-8 and G.S. 44A-7, the trial court found that a company entered into the contract as defendant's agent, which ratified and accepted the contract by performing functions of owner under the contract; these conclusions were not challenged and thus were binding findings of fact that the agent's role was to provide representation services for defendant, and only defendant was authorized to do business in the state, and defendant paid all invoices submitted.

       Purpose.
   
   - The purpose of the materialman's lien statute is to protect the interest of the supplier in the materials it supplies; the materialman, rather than the mortgagee, should have the benefit of materials that go into the property and give it value. To implement this purpose, courts should construe the statute so as to further the legislature's intent. They should construe a remedial statute to advance the remedy intended. Carolina Bldrs. Corp. v. Howard-Veasey Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 324 S.E.2d 626, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 597</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 606 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of this lien statute is to protect the interest of the contractor, laborer or materialman. Embree Constr. Group, Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 487</cite>, 411 S.E.2d 916 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien created by this section secures the right of the claimant to amounts earned whether or not the funds are due or the claimant's job is complete. Embree Constr. Group, Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 487</cite>, 411 S.E.2d 916 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       To enforce a lien under Article 2 of N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 44A, the lienor must have performed work pursuant to a contract, either express or implied, with the owner of real property, under G.S. 44A-8, and read in pari materia, the G.S. 44A-13(b) phrase "principal amount shown to be due" refers to the principal amount due under the contract giving rise to the lien enforcement proceedings pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 44A, Article 2, that is, the contract between the lienor and the owner of real property; if the judgment is awarding the lienor the principal amount due under his contract with the property owner, the interest included in that "principal amount" would be the interest due under the contract with the property owner, and clearly, then, the requirement of an agreement on interest between the parties refers to the agreement between the lienor and the owner of the property.

        Mechanic's Lien Statutes Grant Supplier of Labor or Material Only the Right to File Mechanic's Lien, Not a Security Interest.
       </b>
       - In rejecting appellant creditor's defense to the avoidance of preferential transfers made to a debtor, the court rejected the argument that it held a security interest in the owners' properties at the time of the transfers because North Carolina's mechanic's lien statutes immediately granted a security interest to a supplier who furnished labor or material to improve the property. The mechanic's lien statutes granted a supplier of labor or material only the right to file a mechanic's lien under G.S. 44A-8, which appellant did not do, and only upon the filing of a claim for a mechanic's lien was the owner's property encumbered under G.S. 44A-10; because appellant had not filed such a claim when the transfers were made, no interest was transferred to it, and it had no such interest to release. United Rentals, Inc. v. Angell, 592 F.3d 525 (2010), cert. denied, 131 S. Ct. 121, 2010 U.S. LEXIS 6346, 178 L. Ed. 2d 32 (U.S. 2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       The lien created by this section is incident to and security for a debt.
   
   There can be no lien in the absence of an underlying debt. Lowe's of Fayetteville, Inc. v. Quigley, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 770, 266 S.E.2d 378 (1980); Caldwell's Well Drilling, Inc. v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 730, 340 S.E.2d 518 (1986).

      <p>
       Enforceable Contract Has to Exist to Establish Valid Claim of Lien.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting a builder a lien on owners' real property on the theory of quantum meruit because to establish a valid claim of lien under G.S. 44A-8, an enforceable contract had to exist between the parties; a contract implied-in-law is nothing more than a term of art used to express an equitable remedy used by the court to prevent unjust enrichment, and as quantum meruit is not a theory based upon an actual agreement, it may not establish the contractual relationship necessary to form the basis for filing a claim of lien pursuant to G.S. 44A-8. Waters Edge Builders, LLC v. Longa, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 715 S.E.2d 193 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       There must be a contract, express or implied,
   
   to create a laborer's or materialman's lien. The holder of the lien has a "security" that open or general creditors do not have and that is based on contract. Ridge Community Investors, Inc. v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 234 S.E.2d 6, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 688</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 566 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Without a contract the lien does not exist. Lowe's of Fayetteville, Inc. v. Quigley, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 770, 266 S.E.2d 378 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent express or implied contract, the statutory lien is unavailable. Embree Constr. Group, Inc. v. Rafcor, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 487</cite>, 411 S.E.2d 916 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant was not a materialman for purposes of the statute of repose, G.S. 1-50(5)(b)(9), because plaintiff and defendant had no contract, and defendant's only intent was that of a manufacturer, to place its product into the stream of commerce, without ever intending its product be particularly delivered to plaintiff. Forsyth Mem. Hosp. v. Armstrong World Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 470 S.E.2d 826 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Open Account Can Qualify as Contract.
   
   - Where contractors who performed labor or furnished materials for improvements at <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> debtor's facility on an open account basis asserted statutory liens against certain machinery and equipment at the facility, the contractual arrangement embodied within the open accounts fell within the requirement that there be a contract, either express or implied, and could serve as a basis for claiming a lien under G.S. 44A-8. All Points Capital Corp. v. Laurel Hill Paper Co. (In re Laurel Hill Paper Co.), 393 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008), appeal dismissed, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6875 (M.D.N.C. 2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Third Party Contract Not Implied.
   
   - This article does not provide an exception to the principle that where there is a contract between persons for the furnishing of services or goods to a third person, the latter is not liable on an implied contract simply because he has received such services or goods. Suffolk Lumber Co. v. White, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 182 S.E.2d 215 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       As to whether vendee who orders commencement of work
   
   before acquiring legal title is an owner within the meaning of G.S. 44A-7, see Carolina Bldrs. Corp. v. Howard-Veasey Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 324 S.E.2d 626, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 597</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 606 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff Must Prove Performance Pursuant to Contract with Defendant.
   
   - Plaintiff has the burden of showing, not only that it performed labor or furnished materials for the making of an improvement on defendants' property, but also that the labor was performed or the materials were furnished pursuant to a contract, either express or implied, with defendants. Wilson Elec. Co. v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 189 S.E.2d 758 (1972); Caldwell's Well Drilling, Inc. v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Absence of Contract Justified Dismissal.
   
   - Where much of the evidence offered by plaintiff and all of the evidence offered by defendants tended to show that plaintiff's contract was with the general contractor employed to build the house, and not with defendants, the trial court acted properly in accepting the verdict of the jury and entering judgment dismissing the plaintiff's claim. Wilson Elec. Co. v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 189 S.E.2d 758 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Debts Owing."
   
   - Where plumbing company had contracted with owner of office condominium complex for a total, after change orders, of $43,178.61, and prior to defaulting, owner had paid $30,000.00 toward this total, the "debt owing" to which a lien under this section could attach totalled $13,718.61. W.H. Dail Plumbing, Inc. v. Roger Baker &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 338 S.E.2d 135, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 731</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 398 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Lien Could Not Be Imposed Absent Underlying Debt.
   
   - Where plaintiff sought a personal judgment against owners based on its contract to drill a well and sought to have such personal judgment declared to be a specific lien on the property allegedly conveyed by owners to purchasers, but there was no allegation in the complaint that the purchasers were indebted to plaintiff in any amount, and subsequently plaintiff abandoned its claim for a personal judgment based on the contract by taking a voluntary dismissal of its claim against the owners, when the trial judge granted the purchasers' motion to dismiss under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b) there was no debt or judgment to be secured by a lien on the property in question, and since the court necessarily considered matters outside the pleadings, i.e., the voluntary dismissal of plaintiff 's claim for personal judgment against the owners, the order under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b) was converted to a summary judgment for the purchasers with respect to the dismissal of plaintiff 's claim to have a lien imposed on the property. Caldwell's Well Drilling, Inc. v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 730, 340 S.E.2d 518 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Improvement of Property Not Required.
   
   - There is no requirement in this section that the lienholder's work actually improve the property. Design Assocs. v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 356 S.E.2d 819 (1987).

       No Improvement on Real Property.
   
   - Where contractors who performed labor or furnished materials for improvements at <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> debtor's facility asserted statutory liens against certain machinery and equipment at the facility, the contractors were not entitled to liens because the machinery and equipment, which were intended to remain personal property and could, despite their size and weight, be removed, did not constitute improvements on real property within the meaning of G.S. 44A-7(2) and did not constitute improvements on real property for purposes of G.S. 44A-8. All Points Capital Corp. v. Laurel Hill Paper Co. (In re Laurel Hill Paper Co.), 393 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008), appeal dismissed, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6875 (M.D.N.C. 2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Improvement Found.
   
   - Plaintiff's work preparing a report for a developer went toward making an improvement to the land as required by G.S. 44A-8 as the work constituted an improvement under G.S. 44A-7, and defendants' claim that the work was done under a separate contract was rejected. Ramey Kemp &amp; Assocs. v. Richmond Hills Residential Partners, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 737 S.E.2d 420, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 118</cite>, 748 S.E.2d 143, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1020 (2013).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Lien for Lost Profits.
   
   - A lien under this section attaches only for debts owing for labor done or professional design or surveying services or material furnished. Nothing is said about lost profits. W.H. Dail Plumbing, Inc. v. Roger Baker &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 338 S.E.2d 135, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 731</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 398 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Contractual Relationship Established.
   
   - Because there was no contractual relationship between a contractor and a county, the contractor could not enforce a lien on real property conveyed to the county; the contractor executed a waiver of its materialmen's lien rights within a development and sought to enforce a lien on the property for work performed after the lien waiver was signed and after the property was conveyed to the county, but the contractor did not allege a contractual relationship between it and county, and absent such a relationship, it could not enforce a lien on county real property. Gaines &amp; Co. v. Wendell Falls Residential, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 714 S.E.2d 179 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Issues Tried With Implied Consent.
   
   - Because no objections were raised to evidence concerning agency between defendant and a company, that issue was tried with the implied consent of the parties and the pleadings were deemed to be amended; thus, the challenge to the conclusions regarding agency failed, and enforcement of the lien did not violate the requirement under G.S. 44A-8 that a lienor had to contract with the owner because plaintiff entered into the contract with defendant's agent, and plaintiff was entitled to enforce its lien. Young &amp; McQueen Grading Co. v. Mar-Comm &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 728 S.E.2d 1 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Meaning of "Labor".
   
   - The partial clearing and staking of the building lines on a construction was "labor" under this section as it read prior to the 1975 amendment. Frank H. Conner Co. v. Spanish Inns Charlotte, Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 661</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 785 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "labor" in this section as it read prior to the 1975 amendment was not restricted to unskilled work of an inferior and toilsome nature. Frank H. Conner Co. v. Spanish Inns Charlotte, Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 661</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 785 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Providing rental equipment does not constitute furnishing material,
   
   as the common meaning of the word material is simply "the basic matter (as metal, wood, plastic, fiber) from which the whole or the greater part of something physical (as a machine, tool, building, fabric) is made." Southeastern Steel Erectors, Inc. v. Inco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 424 S.E.2d 433 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       First Furnishing.
   
   - The judgment in defendant's favor properly ordered a sale of the property to enforce defendant's statutory lien, and the lien related back to the date of the first furnishing listed in the claim of lien and judgment even though the court failed to include the beginning date of the work. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Rowell, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 779, 440 S.E.2d 283, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff was seeking payment for work done pursuant to a contract and its amendment, and thus the proper date was the first furnishing of work under this contract and not another contract. Young &amp; McQueen Grading Co. v. Mar-Comm &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 728 S.E.2d 1 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Delivery of Materials to Site.
   
   - The lien claimant is not required to personally make delivery of materials to the site of the improvement, so long as the materialman furnished the goods with the intent that they would later be placed on the site and they were so placed. The lien, when properly perfected, will relate to and take effect from the first furnishing of materials on the site. Raleigh Paint &amp; Wallpaper Co. v. Peacock &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 247 S.E.2d 728 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 415</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 470 (1979); Queensboro Steel Corp. v. East Coast Mach. &amp; Iron Works, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 346 S.E.2d 248, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 508</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 865 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Contractors' mechanics' lien complaint alleging a bank took the subject property at a foreclosure sale subject to the lien was properly dismissed because the contractors had no right to file a lien, as (1) no G.S. 44A-12 claim of lien or G.S. 44A-17 et seq. notice of claim of lien was alleged, and (2) the contractors had no lien against the bank's predecessor, as the predecessor had no interest in the property when the contractors first furnished materials, so the contractors did not contract with the G.S. 44A-8 "owner" of the property. John Conner Constr., Inc. v. Grandfather Holding Co., <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 37, 732 S.E.2d 367 (2012), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 419</cite>, 734 S.E.2d 860, 2012 N.C.

        Compliance with Requisite Elements Created Valid Lien.
       </b>
       - Contractor complied with all the required elements under North Carolina law in order to establish a valid lien under this chapter where it was undisputed that contractor performed pursuant to a contract, that it proved the first date it furnished materials at the construction project and its contract was with the owner of the property since contractor's contract was with person who became legal owner of the property by a valid deed.

      <p>
       Lien of First Tier Subcontractor Recognized.
   
   - G.S. 44A-23 grants to a first tier subcontractor a lien upon real property based upon a right of subrogation to the direct lien of the general contractor on the improved real property as provided in G.S. 44A-8. Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 587 S.E.2d 87 (2003).

       Plaintiff subcontractor could not establish a lien for labor and materials as a prime contractor

      <p>
       Lien Is Inchoate Until Perfected.
   
   - The lien provided for by this section is inchoate until perfected by compliance with G.S. 44A-11 and G.S. 44A-12, and is lost if the steps required for its perfection are not taken in the manner and within the time prescribed by law. Frank H. Conner Co. v. Spanish Inns Charlotte, Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 661</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 785 (1978), decided under this section as it read prior to the 1975 amendment.

       Enforcement of Lien and Arbitration Are Mutually Exclusive.
   
   - The right to file and enforce a lien claim and the right to resolve a dispute through arbitration are mutually exclusive rights. Adams v. Nelsen, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 284, 312 S.E.2d 896 (1984), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 442</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 322 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff, by contractually agreeing to arbitration, did not thereby waive his right to file a lien claim
   
   and to institute court action to enforce such lien, and he was entitled to enforce any award in his favor through a judgment enforcing his lien claim. Adams v. Nelsen, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 284, 312 S.E.2d 896 (1984), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 442</cite>, 329 S.E.2d 322 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Agreement to Arbitrate Did Not Bar Plaintiff from Statutory Remedy.
   
   - Claim of lien, included within complaint of plaintiff, a registered professional engineer, for breach of contract, and filed pursuant to this section, constituted a statutory remedy that was not extinguished merely because plaintiff had entered into a contract providing for arbitration; plaintiff was not foreclosed from pursuing his statutory remedy by agreeing to arbitrate.

        Materialman's Lien Superior to Faulty Deed of Trust.
       </b>
       - Where deed of trust which was recorded did not convey debtor's predecessor's interest in that property, but instead purported to convey an interest which debtor did not have, and the deed was indexed with debtor as grantor and thus was recorded outside of its chain of title which had the same effect on notice as no registration, fact that such deed was signed general partner of actual owner had no effect, hence materialmen's lien was superior to deed of trust.

       Priority over Purchase Money Deed of Trust.
   
   - Where plaintiff had a contract with the owner of the property within the meaning and intent of those terms as used in this section, materials furnished pursuant to that contract gave rise to a statutory materialman's lien which takes precedence over a purchase money deed of trust when there is an intervening construction loan deed of trust.

       Award of Attorneys' Fees Held Error.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting a builder attorney's fees pursuant to G.S. 44A-35 because the trial court awarded the builder attorney fees as the prevailing party, but the builder could not prevail within the meaning of G.S. 44A-35 because the court of appeals concluded that trial court erred in granting the builder a lien on owners' real property on the theory of quantum meruit; to establish a valid claim of lien under G.S. 44A-8, an enforceable contract has to exist between the parties.

       Lien Waiver Merely Released Costs to Date and Did Not Change Date of Creation of Lien.
   
   - Contractor's lien under G.S. 44A-8 had priority over a lender's later-filed deed of trust despite the contractor's execution of partial lien waivers, because the language of the lien waivers merely released the labor and materials costs for which the contractor had been reimbursed as of the date of the waivers. The partial lien waivers functioned as an acknowledgement of payment for labor and materials expended through a certain date and that the contractor had no further lien rights in the furnishing of labor and materials reimbursed by those payments.

       Partial clearing of a site and staking of outlines of the building,
   
   as the "first furnishing of labor," constitute a "visible commencement of an improvement" sufficient to put a prudent man on notice that a possible improvement is underway and that the property might be subject to a lien under G.S. 44A-8.

       First Furnishing.
   
   - The judgment in defendant's favor properly ordered a sale of the property to enforce defendant's statutory lien, and the lien related back to the date of the first furnishing listed in the claim of lien and judgment even though the court failed to include the beginning date of the work.

The lien, when properly perfected, will relate to and take effect from the first furnishing of materials on the site. Raleigh Paint &amp; Wallpaper Co. v.

   - Where it was undisputed that plaintiff first furnished labor or materials at lot for the purpose of bringing the property into compliance with the terms of applicable protective covenants on June 8, 1987, over a year after defendant's deed of trust on the property was recorded, plaintiff did not have priority over defendant and defendant was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

        Encumbrance Created Only Upon Filing of Claim.
       </b>
       - In rejecting appellant creditor's defense to the avoidance of preferential transfers made to a debtor, the court rejected the argument that it held a security interest in the owners' properties at the time of the transfers because North Carolina's mechanic's lien statutes immediately granted a security interest to a supplier who furnished labor or material to improve the property. The mechanic's lien statutes granted a supplier of labor or material only the right to file a mechanic's lien under G.S. 44A-8, which appellant did not do, and only upon the filing of a claim for a mechanic's lien was the owner's property encumbered under G.S. 44A-10; because appellant had not filed such a claim when the transfers were made, no interest was transferred to it, and it had no such interest to release.

       Priority of Contractor's Lien.
   
   - By virtue of this section, a contractor's lien for all labor and materials furnished pursuant to a contract is deemed prior to any liens or encumbrances attaching to the property subsequent to the date of the contractor's first furnishing of labor or materials to the construction site. Frank H. Conner Co. v. Spanish Inns Charlotte, Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 661</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 785 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       A materialman's lien on a leasehold which is properly enforced so as to relate back prior to a deed of trust on the leasehold would, upon foreclosure, entitle the materialman to priority in that portion of the proceeds representing the value of the leasehold. Miller v. Lemon Tree Inn of Roanoke Rapids, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 233 S.E.2d 69 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Priority of Purchase Money Deed of Trust Under Doctrine of Instantaneous Seisin.
   
   - A materialman's lien relates back and takes effect from the time of the first furnishing of materials at the site of the improvement by the person claiming the lien. While the statutory language does not indicate the precise moment of attachment, it does indicate an order of priority between competing lien claimants. That priority can be defeated by the application of the doctrine of instantaneous seisin. Such doctrine provides that when a deed and a purchase money deed of trust are executed, delivered, and recorded as part of the same transaction, the deed of trust attaches at the instant the vendee acquires title and constitutes a lien superior to all others. It would thus subordinate a previously existing materialman's lien. Carolina Bldrs. Corp. v. Howard-Veasey Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 324 S.E.2d 626, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 597</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 606 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Policy supporting the doctrine of instantaneous seisin
   
   is that a vendor who parts with property and supplies the purchase price does so on the basis of having a first priority security interest in the property. The vendor who advances purchase money relies on the assurance that he or she will be able to foreclose on the land if the purchase price is not repaid. It is thus equitable and just that the vendor have a first priority security interest and be protected from the possibility of losing both the land and the money in the transaction. Carolina Bldrs. Corp. v. Howard-Veasey Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 324 S.E.2d 626, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 597</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 606 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Priority Where Holder Gives Construction Lender Priority over Own Interest.
   
   - Since the vendor and the construction lender have the resources and the bargaining power to require the vendee to obtain lien waivers from material suppliers or to obtain title insurance, the court can perceive no reason to extend the doctrine of instantaneous seisin to protect, at the expense of the materialman, the holder of a purchase money security interest who, by consenting to give a construction lender's security an intervening priority over his or her own, has indicated an intent not to be so protected. Carolina Bldrs. Corp. v. Howard-Veasey Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 324 S.E.2d 626, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 597</cite>, 330 S.E.2d 606 (1985).

       Foreclosure Extinguished Liens.
   
   - Foreclosure on and recordation of a bank's deeds of trust on two properties extinguished a materialman's claims of liens on the properties as the foreclosures occurred before the materialman supplied labor and/or materials for use on the properties. Pete Wall Plumbing Co. v. Sandra Anderson Builders, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 721 S.E.2d 663 (2011).

        Lien Waivers Not Effective as Against Another Creditor in Bankruptcy Proceeding.
       </b>
       - Lien waivers executed by a general contractor, who made a prima facie showing that his lien had priority under G.S. 44A-10, 44A-12(b), and 44A-13(a), did not give a bank priority because the general contractor expressly did not waive lien rights for work that had not been paid and for retainage, and the retainage for which the lien rights were not waived accrued before the bank began its lending relationship with the debtor. Thus, the general contractor's lien rights, which related back to the first furnishing of materials under G.S. 44A-10, had priority over the bank pursuant to G.S. 47-20. Lee F. Cowper, Inc. v. Watermark Marina of Wilmington, LLC (In re Watermark Marina of Wilmington, LLC), - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Nov. 24, 2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lien Waiver Merely Released Costs to Date and Did Not Change Date of Creation of Lien.
   
   - Contractor's lien under G.S. 44A-8 had priority over a lender's later-filed deed of trust despite the contractor's execution of partial lien waivers, because the language of the lien waivers merely released the labor and materials costs for which the contractor had been reimbursed as of the date of the waivers. The partial lien waivers functioned as an acknowledgement of payment for labor and materials expended through a certain date and that the contractor had no further lien rights in the furnishing of labor and materials reimbursed by those payments. Wachovia Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Superior Constr. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C.

       A claim of lien is not fatally defective because of an obvious scrivener's error
   
   in stating the date of first furnishing it. Canady v. Creech, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 354</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 383 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a claim of lien for labor and materials in connection with the construction of a dwelling on certain property was filed on October 8, 1973, within 120 days from the last day the materials and supplies were furnished, but the claim of lien erroneously recited that the labor and materials were first furnished on December 4, 1973, and where on August 20, 1973, the property was conveyed, the erroneous statement in the claim of lien as to the date of first furnishing did not preclude enforcement of the lien against the purchasers, since they had constructive notice of the facts upon which the claim of lien was based and could not take advantage of a scrivener's error in the claim relative to these facts and upon which they did not rely to defeat the lien, which, because of these facts, related back to a time that predated their purchase.

      </p>
      <p>
       Filing of Action Did Not Relate Back to Filing Claim of Lien.
   
   - G.S. 44A-10 caused a subcontractor's claim of lien to relate back to the first date materials were provided, but had nothing to do with the effective date of the action to enforce the claim; a lien was not an action, and thus for purposes of a motion to consolidate, the filing of the action did not relate back to the date of the filing of the claim of lien.

      </p>
      <p>
       No Contractual Relationship Established.
   
   - Because there was no contractual relationship between a contractor and a county, the contractor could not enforce a lien on real property conveyed to the county; the contractor executed a waiver of its materialmen's lien rights within a development and sought to enforce a lien on the property for work performed after the lien waiver was signed and after the property was conveyed to the county, but the contractor did not allege a contractual relationship between it and the county, and absent such a relationship, it could not enforce a lien on county real property.

        Lien Waivers Not Effective as Against Another Creditor in Bankruptcy Proceeding.
       </b>
       - Lien waivers executed by a general contractor, who made a prima facie showing that his lien had priority under G.S. 44A-10, 44A-12(b), and 44A-13(a), did not give a bank priority because the general contractor expressly did not waive lien rights for work that had not been paid and for retainage, and the retainage for which the lien rights were not waived accrued before the bank began its lending relationship with the debtor. Thus, the general contractor's lien rights, which related back to the first furnishing of materials under G.S. 44A-10, had priority over the bank pursuant to G.S. 47-20. Lee F. Cowper, Inc. v. Watermark Marina of Wilmington, LLC (In re Watermark Marina of Wilmington, LLC), - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Nov. 24, 2009).

       A lien is lost if the steps required to perfect it are not taken in the same manner and within the time prescribed
   
   by law. Strickland v. General Bldg. &amp; Masonry Contractors, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 729, 207 S.E.2d 399 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff was not entitled to enforce by means of its second lien an obligation which was asserted but not enforced in its first lien where plaintiff's second claim of lien contained incorrect statements concerning the date of first furnishings, and the alleged amount owed; thus the claim was defective. Plaintiff also failed to cancel this second lien and substitute a new claim of lien containing the correct information within the prescribed time. Gaston Grading &amp; Landscaping v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 719, 449 S.E.2d 475 (1994).

       Filing Is Required.
   
   - Although a second tier subcontractor must notice its claim of lien using a format substantially similar to that provided in G.S. 44A-19, perfection of this lien is not achieved merely upon proper notice; the claim of lien must also be filed pursuant to this section before it is considered perfected. Cameron &amp; Barkley Co. v. American Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 434 S.E.2d 632 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       First Furnishing.
   
   - The judgment in defendant's favor properly ordered a sale of the property to enforce defendant's statutory lien, and the lien related back to the date of the first furnishing listed in the claim of lien and judgment even though the court failed to include the beginning date of the work. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Rowell, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 779, 440 S.E.2d 283, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff was seeking payment for work done pursuant to a contract and its amendment, and thus the proper date was the first furnishing of work under this contract and not another contract. Young &amp; McQueen Grading Co. v. Mar-Comm &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 728 S.E.2d 1 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Delivery of Materials to Site.
   
   - The lien claimant is not required to personally make delivery of materials to the site of the improvement so long as the materialman furnished the goods with the intent that they would later be placed on the site and they were so placed. The lien, when properly perfected, will relate to and take effect from the first furnishing of materials on the site. Raleigh Paint &amp; Wallpaper Co. v. Peacock &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 247 S.E.2d 728 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 415</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 470 (1979); Queensboro Steel Corp. v.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Date in Claim of Lien Is Binding.
   
   - Barring an obvious error, easily discernible to the title examiner, the plaintiff is bound by the date stated in his claim of lien. Beach &amp; Adams Bldrs., Inv. v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 220 S.E.2d 414 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The plaintiff was not entitled to amend or change the date of last furnishing stated in his claim of lien, where such date, on its face, was not an obvious typographical error, and as the claim of lien was filed more than 120 days after the last date of furnishing, it was void and subject to cancellation. Brown v. Middleton, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 356 S.E.2d 386 (1987).

       Contents.
   
   - A claim of lien need only identify the owner, the claimant, and the party with which the claimant contracted. Thus, while plaintiff's claim of lien met the requirements of this section, the claim of lien did not meet the requirements of G.S. 44A-19, because the claim of lien did not name defendant or assert rights available to plaintiff via a notice of claim of lien. Universal Mechanical, Inc. v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 442 S.E.2d 130 (1994).

      <p>
       Description contained in a claim of lien filed by a supplier of labor and materials for installation of a paper machine and additional work substantially complied with G.S. 44A-12(c)(6) because, although the description referred only to installation of a paper machine, the reference was sufficient to put parties on notice regarding the project that included the installation of a paper machine and to provide notice as to the other work provided by the supplier in the course of that project. All Points Capital Corp. v. Laurel Hill Paper Co. (In re Laurel Hill Paper Co.), 393 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008), appeal dismissed, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6875 (M.D.N.C. 2009).

      <p>
       Description contained in a claim of lien filed by a supplier of stainless steel piping, tubing and fittings, valves, controls and process equipment substantially complied with G.S. 44A-12(c)(6) because, although the supplier erroneously described that the materials were to be used in the plumbing/sewer/water system of the customer's plant, the description was not misleading and was sufficient to put an interested party on notice regarding the materials supplied which were part of a piping system located within the plant. All Points Capital Corp. v. Laurel Hill Paper Co. (In re Laurel Hill Paper Co.), 393 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008), appeal dismissed, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6875 (M.D.N.C. 2009).

       Materialman's filings were sufficient to protect its rights under both parts of Article 2 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.044A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 44A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, as they contained all of the information required by G.S. 44A-12 and G.S.44A-19, and enough information to allow a title searcher to ascertain which entities were potential claimants and how each was connected to the real estate.

      </p>
      <p>
       Because plaintiff contracted with defendant's agent, the agent's contracting with plaintiff was the act of defendant, and thus the claim of lien properly listed defendant.

       A claim of lien is not fatally defective because of an obvious scrivener's error

      <p>
       Where a claim of lien for labor and materials in connection with the construction of a dwelling on certain property was filed on October 8, 1973, within 120 days from the last day the materials and supplies were furnished, but the claim of lien erroneously recited that the labor and materials were first furnished on December 4, 1973, and where on August 20, 1973, the property was conveyed, the erroneous statement in the claim of lien as to the date of first furnishing did not preclude enforcement of the lien against the purchasers, since they had constructive notice of the facts upon which the claim of lien was based and could not take advantage of a scrivener's error in the claim relative to these facts and upon which they did not rely to defeat the lien, which, because of these facts, related back to a time that predated their purchase.

       in which the contractor warrants that title to all work, materials and equipment is free and clear of all liens, claims, security interest or encumbrances if construed as a complete waiver of statutory lien rights, was invalid and unenforceable under North Carolina law.

       Claim of Materialman, etc., Need Not State Date of Last Furnishing.

   - Supplier of materials to a <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> debtor on open account did not file a timely notice of claim of lien because the notice was filed outside the 120 days allowed by G.S. 44A-12; the removal of trailers containing the debtor's supplies was insufficient to constitute last work for purposes of G.S. 44A-12 because the removal was not required under any aspect of the contractual arrangement between the debtor and the supplier, and the removal was not done in good faith. All Points Capital Corp. v. Laurel Hill Paper Co. (In re Laurel Hill Paper Co.), 393 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008), appeal dismissed, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6875 (M.D.N.C. 2009).

       Notice of Claim of Lien.

   - Suppliers of materials to a <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> debtor on open account timely filed notices of claim of lien because the notices were filed within the 120 days allowed by G.S. 44A-12.

       Plaintiff's claim of lien was filed well within the 120-day period under G.S. 44A-12(b) where: (1) plaintiff worked for a developer under a contract dated 10 August 2005 until 24 February 2010; (2) plaintiff's work often spanned months or even years in a given development, sometimes with long gaps between service; (3) the services were provided under a single seamless contract; (4) the last work performed by plaintiff was made based on a specific request on behalf of the developer; and (5) defendants' claim that the work was performed under a separate contract was not supported.

      <p>
       Lien Held Void.
   
   - Where plaintiff, in claim of lien, stated that materials were last furnished upon the property on March 28, 1973, which date was more than 120 days prior to July 27, 1973, when the claim was filed, the lien itself was void.

      </p>
      <p>
       Contractors' mechanics' lien complaint alleging a bank took the subject property at a foreclosure sale subject to the lien was properly dismissed because the contractors had no right to file a lien, as (1) no G.S. 44A-12 claim of lien or G.S. 44A-17 et seq. notice of claim of lien was alleged, and (2) the contractors had no lien against the bank's predecessor, as the predecessor had no interest in the property when the contractors first furnished materials, so the contractors did not contract with the G.S. 44A-8 "owner" of the property.

       Where and When Action Commenced. - An action to enforce a claim of lien on real property may be commenced in any county where venue is otherwise proper. No such action may be commenced later than 180 days after the last furnishing of labor or materials at the site of the improvement by the person claiming the claim of lien on real property. If the title to the real property against which the claim of lien on real property is asserted is by law vested in a receiver or is subject to the control of the bankruptcy court, the claim of lien on real property shall be enforced in accordance with the orders of the court having jurisdiction over said real property. The filing of a proof of claim with a receiver or in bankruptcy and the filing of a notice of lis pendens in each county where the real property subject to the claim of lien on real property is located within the time required by this section satisfies the requirement for the commencement of a civil action.

The notice of lis pendens shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (a) of this section for the commencement of the action by the lien claimant. If neither an action nor a notice of lis pendens is filed in accordance with this section, the judgment entered in the action enforcing the claim of lien on real property shall not direct a sale of the real property subject to the claim of lien on real property enforced thereby nor be entitled to any priority under the provisions of G.S. 44A-14(a), but shall be entitled only to those priorities accorded by law to money judgments.

       Subsequent Purchaser and Lender No Longer Necessary or Proper Parties Upon Discharge of Claim of Lien After Action Is Filed. - If an action to enforce a lien under this section is commenced before the claim of lien is discharged pursuant to G.S. 44A-16(a)(5) or G.S. 44A-16(a)(6), a subsequent purchaser of the real property upon which the lien is claimed and the subsequent purchaser's lender shall cease to be a necessary or proper party to the action, and any claim for lien enforcement asserted against the subsequent purchaser of the real property upon which the lien is claimed or the subsequent purchaser's lender shall be dismissed upon motion of any party upon a showing that the claim of lien was discharged pursuant to G.S. 44A-16. However, nothing herein precludes the lien claimant from continuing to pursue any claims against any party that are separate and distinct from enforcement of the lien.

       Bonds Prohibited From Requiring Subsequent Purchaser or Lender to Remain Parties to Action After Discharge of Claim of Lien. -  The fact that a subsequent purchaser of the real property upon which the lien is claimed or the subsequent purchaser's lender is not a party to an action to enforce a claim of lien on real property subsequent to discharge of that claim of lien by the contractor under G.S. 44A-16 shall not invalidate the claim of lien under this Chapter, nor shall it invalidate any bond filed under G.S. 44A-16 to discharge the claim of lien. Further, a bond filed under G.S. 44A-16(a)(6) shall not require that a subsequent purchaser of the real property upon which the lien is claimed or the subsequent purchaser's lender remain a party to an action to enforce a claim of lien after the claim of lien has been discharged pursuant to G.S. 44A-16.

       To enforce a lien under Article 2 of N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 44A,
   
   the lienor must have performed work pursuant to a contract, either express or implied, with the owner of real property, under G.S. 44A-8, and read in pari materia, the G.S. 44A-13(b) phrase "principal amount shown to be due" refers to the principal amount due under the contract giving rise to the lien enforcement proceedings pursuant to N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 44A, Article 2, that is, the contract between the lienor and the owner of real property; if the judgment is awarding the lienor the principal amount due under his contract with the property owner, the interest included in that "principal amount" would be the interest due under the contract with the property owner, and clearly, then, the requirement of an agreement on interest between the parties refers to the agreement between the lienor and the owner of the property.

       Specific Statute Controls General Section Establishing One Form of Action.
   
   - A particular statute controls a general one with reference to the same subject matter. Subsection (a) of this section specifically directs that a lien against property vested in a trustee in bankruptcy "shall be enforced" in accordance with the orders of the bankruptcy court; this provision controls over G.S. 1A-1, Rule 2, which is a general rule establishing one form of action. Therefore, an action under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 2 was not required to enforce lien. RDC, Inc. v. Brookleigh Bldrs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 182</cite>, 305 S.E.2d 722 (1983).

      <p>
       Plaintiff, by contractually agreeing to arbitration, did not thereby waive his right to file a lien claim
   
   and institute court action to enforce such lien, and he was entitled to enforce any award in his favor through a judgment enforcing his lien claim. Adams v. Nelsen, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 284, 312 S.E.2d 896 (1984).

       Enforceable Contract has to Exist to Establish Valid Claim of Lien.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting a builder a lien on an owners' real property on the theory of quantum meruit because to establish a valid claim of lien under G.S. 44A-8, an enforceable contract had to exist between the parties; a contract implied-in-law is nothing more than a term of art used to express an equitable remedy used by the court to prevent unjust enrichment, and as quantum meruit is not a theory based upon an actual agreement, it may not establish the contractual relationship necessary to form the basis for filing a claim of lien pursuant to G.S. 44A-8.

       - Although a landscape company's claim of lien filed against a debtor arose out of work furnished prior to a general contractor's start date, once the landscape company made the strategic decision to execute on its state court default judgment against the debtor rather than pursue its lien position, then under G.S. 44A-13, its lien rights could no longer be enforced.

        Lien Waivers Not Effective as Against Another Creditor in Bankruptcy Proceeding.

       - Lien waivers executed by a general contractor, who made a prima facie showing that his lien had priority under G.S. 44A-10, 44A-12(b), and 44A-13(a), did not give a bank priority because the general contractor expressly did not waive lien rights for work that had not been paid and for retainage, and the retainage for which the lien rights were not waived accrued before the bank began its lending relationship with the debtor. Thus, the general contractor's lien rights, which related back to the first furnishing of materials under G.S. 44A-10, had priority over the bank pursuant to G.S. 47-20. Lee F. Cowper, Inc. v.

   of this section to the amount stated in the claim. W.H. Dail Plumbing, Inc. v. Roger Baker &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 338 S.E.2d 135, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 731</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 398 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment enforcing a lien under subsection (b) cannot exceed the amount determined to be due from the defendant to the plaintiff; thus, portion of judgment ordering attorney's fees awarded by jury to be enforced as a part of the lien was a nullity. Paving Equip. of Carolinas, Inc. v. Waters, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 470 S.E.2d 546 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Contest of Amount of Lien.
   
   - Subsection (b) of this section contemplates that a defendant has the right to contest the amount of plaintiff's lien during enforcement proceedings, and not prior thereto. Frank H. Conner Co. v. Spanish Inns Charlotte, Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 661</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 785 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Contents of Judgment Enforcing Lien.
   
   - To enforce a materialman's lien the judgment must state the effective date of the lien and contain a general description of the property subject to the lien, so that one reading the docketed judgment will have notice that it was more than a money judgment. Miller v. Lemon Tree Inn of Roanoke Rapids, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 524, 233 S.E.2d 69 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of subsection (c) is to give protection to purchasers and examiners of titles
   
   no matter where the action to enforce the lien is instituted. Ridge Community Investors, Inc. v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 688</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 566 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liens established pursuant to this Chapter are not "contractual security"
   
   within the meaning of G.S. 1A-1, Rule 55(b)(1), and a clerk or assistant clerk of court is without jurisdiction to make orders consummating foreclosure of liens established pursuant to this Chapter. Ridge Community Investors, Inc. v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 688</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 566 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal of a suit on account of plaintiff's inability to establish an alleged lien was improper
   
   where the complaint, in addition to averring the lien and praying for its foreclosure, stated a good cause of action for labor performed or materials supplied. Lowe's of Fayetteville, Inc. v. Quigley, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 770, 266 S.E.2d 378 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An action to enforce a lien need not be filed in the county where the land is situated.
   
   Ridge Community Investors, Inc. v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 234 S.E.2d 6, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 688</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 566 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Better Practice Is to File Where Claim of Lien Is Filed.
   
   - It is the better practice to file the action to enforce a lien in the county in which the claim of lien is filed. Ridge Community Investors, Inc. v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 688</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 566 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Language in Subsection (a) Is Not a Jurisdictional Requirement.
   
   - The language contained in subsection (a) stating that the action to enforce a lien "may be instituted in any county in which the lien is filed" is not a jurisdictional requirement. Ridge Community Investors, Inc. v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 688</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 566 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1977 amendment adding subsection (c) is a strong indication that it was not the intent of the legislature to enact a jurisdictional requisite when it used language in subsection (a) to the effect that such action "may be instituted in any county in which the lien is filed." Ridge Community Investors, Inc. v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 688</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 566 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Date in Claim of Lien Is Binding.
   
   - Barring an obvious error, easily discernible to the title examiner, the plaintiff is bound by the date stated in his claim of lien. Beach &amp; Adams Bldrs., Inc. v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 220 S.E.2d 414 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Lien Not Barred by Failure of Court to Include Beginning and Ending Dates of Work in Judgment.
   
   - Where a plaintiff pursued his recovery by filing both a claim of lien and action, and had at all times maintained its request for a lien in its complaint and appeal, the judgment relating back and incorporating the complaint and claim of lien included all the information required, except the effective date of the lien, then plaintiff should not have been barred from the benefits of a remedy by the trial court's failure to include in its judgment the beginning and ending dates of the work. Jennings Glass Co. v. Brummer, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 362 S.E.2d 578 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       While the date of last furnishing is not statutorily required, it cannot be deemed mere "surplusage"
   
   when supplied, even voluntarily. To do so would do injury to the purpose of the lien statute, in that title examiners would, barring an obvious error, reasonably rely on the date actually furnished. Beach &amp; Adams Bldrs., Inc. v. Northwestern Bank, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 220 S.E.2d 414 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Claim of lien is not fatally defective because of an obvious scrivener's error
   
   in stating the date of first furnishing it. Canady v. Creech, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 354</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 383 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Delivery of Materials to Site.
   
   - The lien claimant is not required to personally make delivery of materials to the site of the improvement so long as the materialman furnished the goods with the intent that they would later be placed on the site and they were so placed. The lien, when properly perfected, will relate to and take effect from the first furnishing of materials on the site. Raleigh Paint &amp; Wallpaper Co. v. Peacock &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 247 S.E.2d 728 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 415</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 470 (1979); Queensboro Steel Corp. v. East Coast Mach. &amp; Iron Works, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 346 S.E.2d 248, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 508</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 865 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Lien Claimant Not Entitled to Foreclosure Sale Surplus Where He Failed to Timely Commence An Enforcement Action.
   
   - Although the subsequent buyer of the property at a foreclosure sale had perfected his lien, he was not entitled to any of the surplus funds from the foreclosure sale where he had failed to timely commence an action to enforce his lien. Lynch v. Price Homes, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 83, 575 S.E.2d 543 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The judgment in defendant's favor properly ordered a sale of the property to enforce defendant's statutory lien,
   
   and the lien related back to the date of the first furnishing listed in the claim of lien and judgment even though the court failed to include the beginning date of the work. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Rowell, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 779, 440 S.E.2d 283, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 444 S.E.2d 231 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 518</cite>, 452 S.E.2d 813 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prejudgment Interest.
   
   - Prejudgment interest is not authorized when only enforcing a statutory lien, absent a contract between the parties. W.H. Dail Plumbing, Inc. v. Roger Baker &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 338 S.E.2d 135, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 731</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 398 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Recovery of Interest Under Contract.
   
   - Contract in this case permitted plaintiff to recover interest on past-due payments, and under the case law, plaintiff could recover accrued interest. Young &amp; McQueen Grading Co. v. Mar-Comm &amp; Assocs., <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 728 S.E.2d 1 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action to Recover Money Damages and to Enforce Lien.
   
   - Action to enforce a materialmen's lien did not need to be filed in the county where the liened property was located; because the primary purpose of a contractor's suit was recovery of money damages, but also requested enforcement of a lien, venue was proper in the county where the contractor had its principal place of business, even though the liened property was located in a different county. Wellons Constr., Inc. v. Landsouth Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 607 S.E.2d 695 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Supported Value Assessed for Materials and Services Rendered.
   
   - Given the evidence and the inexact nature of ascertaining a definite cost for the type of service a builder provided, the value as assessed by the trial court, for the materials and services rendered by the builder and accepted by the owners, was reasonable and supported by competent evidence. Waters Edge Builders, LLC v. Longa, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 715 S.E.2d 193 (2011).

      - The preamble to Session Laws 2013-401, provides: "Whereas, the legislature recognizes that there is a public need for the design, construction, improvement, renovation, and expansion of high-performing public buildings within the State of North Carolina; and "Whereas, the public need may not be, in limited situations, wholly satisfied by existing procurement methods in which public buildings are designed, constructed, improved, renovated, or expanded; and
     </p>

      "Whereas, many local governmental entities request special legislative authorization to enter into public-private partnerships and use design-build contracting every legislative session; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, in some instances, more efficient delivery of quality design and construction can be realized when a governmental entity is authorized to utilize an integrated approach for the design and construction of a project under one contract with a single point of responsibility; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the design-build integrated approach to project delivery, based upon qualifications and experience, in some instances, can yield improved collaboration among design professionals, builders, and owners throughout the entire process and deliver a quality and cost-efficient building; and

       Subdivision (a)(6) is more for the benefit of the landowner
   
   than the lien-creditor. Gelder &amp; Assocs. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 731, 239 S.E.2d 604 (1977), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 441</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 843 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary purpose of subdivision (a)(6) of this section is to protect the landowner, not the lien claimant, who is already protected by virtue of the lien on the property. George v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 755</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 43 (1992).

       The primary purpose of subdivision (a)(6)
   
   of this section is to provide the landowner a convenient way to unburden his property while the lien claimant's claim is litigated. George v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 755</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 43 (1992).

      <p>
       Lien Not Cancelled by Voluntary Dismissal.
   
   - In light of the requirement of subdivision (a)(4) of this section that a judgment must be filed to discharge a lien, a lien may not be cancelled by taking a voluntary dismissal without prejudice. Newberry Metal Masters Fabricators, Inc. v. Mitek Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 250</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 383 (1993).

       Three Year Limitations Period Applied to Action to Recover on Surety Bond.
   
   - Subsection (1) of G.S. 1-52, which provides for a three year statute of limitations, applied to subcontractor's action to recover on contractor's surety bond. George v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 761, 404 S.E.2d 1 (1991), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 755</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 43 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's Liability on Bond Did Not Accrue Until Amount Established.
   
   - Where a bond obligated defendant to "pay the full amount of the Lien Claim as established in any appropriate court proceeding," under the clear wording of the bond, the defendant's liability did not accrue until the amount was "established in any appropriate court proceeding."
   The amount was established in the award of the arbitrator in May, 1988 and became a final judgment August, 1988.
   Thus plaintiff's claim filed in February 1989 was timely. George v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 761, 404 S.E.2d 1 (1991), modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 755</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 43 (1992).

      <p>
       When Limitations Period Begins to Run in Favor of Corporate Surety.
   
   - The statute of limitations begins to run in favor of a corporate surety which has filed a bond discharging a lien under subdivision (a)(6) of this section when final judgment is entered in favor of the lien claimant. George v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 755</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 43 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A corporate surety bond acts as a substitute for the land;
   
   the lien claimant's right to make demand upon the bond accrues at the same time that he would have been able to enforce the lien against the land: at final judgment in his favor. George v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 755</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 43 (1992).

      <p>
       Landowner Free to Sell, Mortgage, etc., Land After Action Under Subdivisions (a)(5) or (a)(6).
   
   - Under subdivision (a)(6) of this section the landowner can post a bond and free his land from the weight of the lien while the parties litigate over the amount, if any, that may finally be determined to be due. He can accomplish the same result by depositing cash with the clerk under subdivision (a)(5). He is then free to sell, mortgage or otherwise encumber the land free of the lien. Gelder &amp; Assocs. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C.

       Foreclosure Extinguished Liens.
   
   - Materialman's notices of claims and liens were properly discharged as the materialman did not begin enforcement proceedings until after a sublessee's interest in the properties had been extinguished by the conveyance of the properties to the private owners.

       Failure to Comply With G.S. 44A-13(a).
   
   - Suppliers of materials to a <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.011.html" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a></cite> debtor failed to comply with G.S. 44A-13(a) and therefore had their liens discharged pursuant to G.S. 44A-16(3) (now G.S. 44A-16(a)(3)) because they failed to file a notice of lis pendens in the county where the debtor's property was located; the fact that the debtor's real property was sold before the time for filing a notice of lis pendens expired did not obviate the need for filing a notice of lis pendens. All Points Capital Corp. v. Laurel Hill Paper Co. (In re Laurel Hill Paper Co.), 393 B.R. 372 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008), appeal dismissed, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6875 (M.D.N.C. 2009).

      <p>
       Contractors' mechanics' lien complaint alleging a bank took the subject property at a foreclosure sale subject to the lien was properly dismissed because the contractors had no right to file a lien, as (1) no G.S. 44A-12 claim of lien or G.S. 44A-17 et seq. notice of claim of lien was alleged, and (2) the contractors had no lien against the bank's predecessor, as the predecessor had no interest in the property when the contractors first furnished materials, so the contractors did not contract with the G.S. 44A-8 "owner" of the property.

       The primary purpose of a lien statute
   
   is to protect laborers and materialmen who expend their labor and materials upon the buildings of others. Southeastern Steel Erectors, Inc. v. Inco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 424 S.E.2d 433 (1993).

       Adequate Lien for Subcontractors and Suppliers of Materials and Labor.
   
   - Appellate court erred in reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the product supplier that found the product supplier was entitled to judgment in the amount specified in its notice of lien sent to the manufacturer; the state constitution and statutory law provided that a materialman was entitled to an adequate lien on the subject matter of the materials supplied, the product supplier sent a notice of lien for a certain amount to the manufacturer after the product supplier became aware that the contractor with whom the manufacturer had contracted was having financial difficulties, and the manufacturer nevertheless paid the contractor, instead of the product supplier, shortly before the contractor went bankrupt. O &amp; M Indus. v. Smith Eng'g Co., <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 263</cite>, 624 S.E.2d 345 (2006).
   <br />

      <p>
       Liberal Construction.
   
   - The lien statute is remedial in nature and, therefore, should be liberally construed to advance the legislature's intent. No statute, however, should be construed so liberally as to give it a meaning never intended by the legislature. Southeastern Steel Erectors, Inc. v. Inco, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C.

       Meaning of "Labor".

       Materials are furnished within the meaning of this section if,
   
   pursuant to a subcontract, a subcontractor delivers materials to the site of improvement to real property. Contract Steel Sales, Inc. v. Freedom Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 353 S.E.2d 418, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 215</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 547 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Materials are furnished within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section when, pursuant to a subcontract, materials are delivered to the site of improvement, and there is no need that they be incorporated into the improvement itself.

       The rental of equipment is not within the scope of "labor or materials"

      </p>
      <p>
       Providing rental equipment does not constitute furnishing material, as the common meaning of the word material is simply "the basic matter (as metal, wood, plastic, fiber) from which the whole or the greater part of something physical (as a machine, tool, building, fabric) is made."

       Summary Judgment Proper
   
   - Trial court properly granted the owners' summary judgment motion as to a subcontractor's claim for a lien on funds under G.S. 44A-18(1), as the contractor's claim against the owners had been arbitrated, and after the contractor's claim was set-off against the owners' claim, the contractor was indebted to the owners.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary Judgment Improper.
   
   - Genuine issue of material fact existed on whether an unpaid contract balance remained between a contractor and a subcontractor thereby precluding summary judgment on a claim of lien made by the supplier, a second-tier subcontractor, on the subcontractor's funds under G.S. 44A-18. Park East Sales, LLC v. Clark-Langley, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 651 S.E.2d 235 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 360</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 736 (2008), review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 360</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 737 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Lien on Funds Does Not Arise by Subrogation
   
   - Subcontractor's lien on funds does not arise by subrogation; rather, under G.S. 44A-18(1), a lien in favor of the subcontractor can attach only to funds owed by an owner to a contractor. Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 587 S.E.2d 87 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       If nothing is owing to the first tier subcontractor, the second tier subcontractor has no right to enforce his lien
   
   under the plain language of this section. Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 389 S.E.2d 128, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).

       <b>
        Notice to Be Filed Following Receipt of Payment.
       </b>
       - Subcontractor who receives payments from a contractor within 90 days of the contractor's filing for bankruptcy does not perfect his lien by the mere receipt and possession of the payments; he must still file the statutory notice in order to become a secured creditor and protect his receipt of payments from avoidance by the bankruptcy trustee. Precision Walls, Inc. v. Crampton, 196 Bankr. 299 (E.D.N.C. 1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Tiered Subcontractor May Enforce Lien of General Contractor Under G.S.
   
   44A-23. - G.S. 44A-23 expressly preserves the rights of a first, second or third tier subcontractor to enforce the lien of the general contractor. This construction is supported by the inclusion of the language that upon filing of the notice and claim of lien "no action of the contractor shall be effective to prejudice the rights of the subcontractor without his written consent." This language, not found in this section, indicates that the legislature intended for the subcontractor to be secured by a mechanic's lien to the full extent of his claim. Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 389 S.E.2d 128, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is true that G.S. 44A-23 expressly limits the tiered subcontractor's lien only "to the extent of his claim," this language does not mean "to the extent of his claim as permitted by this section." Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 389 S.E.2d 128, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).

      <p>
       What Is First Tier Subcontractor's Lien upon Funds.
   
   - The first tier subcontractor's lien upon funds contemplated by subdivision (1) of this section is a lien upon funds which are owed and not upon funds which might have been owed had the contract been completed. Mace v. Bryant Constr. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 269 S.E.2d 191 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Lien Under Subdivision (1) Necessary for Lien Under G.S. 44A-20(d).
   
   - The existence of a lien upon the realty granted by G.S. 44A-20(d) is dependent upon the existence of a valid lien upon funds pursuant to subdivision (1) of this section. Mace v. Bryant Constr. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 269 S.E.2d 191 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontractor's Lien Recognized
   
   - Appellate court has long recognized that a lien in favor of a subcontractor may arise either directly under G.S. 44A-18 and G.S. 44A-20 or by subrogation under G.S. 44A-23. Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 587 S.E.2d 87 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A lien upon realty may arise directly in favor of a first tier subcontractor
   
   under subdivision (1) of this section and G.S. 44A-20, and the right to such a lien, unlike the right to a lien under G.S. 44A-23, may arise without regard to whether the general contractor has waived its own lien rights. Mace v. Bryant Constr. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 269 S.E.2d 191 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontractor's Right Not Affected by Prime Contractor's Waiver.
   
   - Prime contractor's waiver of the right to establish a lien does not affect subcontractor's right to perfect a lien as a subcontractor under this section. Con Co., Inc. v. Wilson Acres Apts., Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 661, 289 S.E.2d 633, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 382</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 206 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontractor's Right Not Affected by Amounts Due or Completion of Performance.
   
   - Where the plaintiff subcontractor, pursuant to a subcontract with the general contractor, furnished materials to the site of improvement to the real property improved, pursuant to this section, the plaintiff was entitled to a lien upon funds owed by the owner to the general contractor, regardless of whether or not the amounts were due and whether or not performance or delivery was complete. Contract Steel Sales, Inc. v. Freedom Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 353 S.E.2d 418, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 215</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 547 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontractor Need Not Deliver Materials Personally.
   
   - This section, which grants a lien to subcontractors "who furnished labor or materials at the site of the improvement," does not require that the subcontractor claiming the lien personally deliver the materials to the building site. Queensboro Steel Corp. v. East Coast Mach. &amp; Iron Works, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 346 S.E.2d 248, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 508</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 865 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Physical Presence of Materials When Notice Is Given Not Required.
   
   - Just as actual incorporation into the improvement is not a statutory prerequisite, neither does the statute require that the materials be physically present on the site at the time notice of lien is given. Contract Steel Sales, Inc. v. Freedom Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 215</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 547 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Second-Tier Subcontractor Had No Lien Rights Upon Funds.
   
   - Since nothing was owed to the first-tier subcontractor at or after the time that the second-tier subcontractor filed its lien claim, it was undisputed that the second-tier subcontractor had no lien rights upon funds under this section. Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff's Subrogation Claim Barred.
   
   - Plaintiff had an adequate legal remedy in the form of a statutory lien against defendants pursuant to this section, but did not exercise it in a timely manner.
   Failure to timely assert the remedy is not a circumstance that renders the statutory remedy "inadequate," because to do so would allow a party to circumvent equitable principles.
   Therefore, the existence of a legal remedy acts as a legal bar to plaintiff's subrogation claim, and the trial court properly granted summary judgment for defendants. Jones Cooling &amp; Heating, Inc. v. Booth, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 757, 394 S.E.2d 292 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 732</cite>, 404 S.E.2d 869 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       If a third tier subcontractor delivers materials to a second tier subcontractor
   
   with the intent that the materials ultimately be delivered at the site, and the materials are actually delivered at the site, the third tier subcontractor has a lien on the funds owed to the second tier subcontractor for those materials. Queensboro Steel Corp. v. East Coast Mach. &amp; Iron Works, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 182, 346 S.E.2d 248, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 508</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 865 (1986).

        Receipt of Notice.
       </b>
       - Subcontractor's claim of lien was properly filed because although there was a minor procedural defect in the filing of the claim of lien, an owner and general contractor were not prejudiced in any way merely because the notice of claim of lien was not filed as an attachment to the claim of lien since the owner was put on notice of the claim of lien and understood how the lien arose; the subcontractor failed to state why it was entitled to a lien on real property pursuant to G.S. 44A-20(d), but in the answer of the owner and contractor, it was admitted that the subcontractor made repeated demands for payment on numerous occasions, which were denied based upon the subcontractor's alleged failure to complete all of the work and to complete the work in a workmanlike manner.

       Purpose of Notice.
   
   - The notice of claim of lien filed by the subcontractor is for the purpose of giving the owner obligor notice; the notice is not intended to protect innocent third parties and does not affect the title to the real property being improved. Contract Steel Sales, Inc. v. Freedom Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 353 S.E.2d 418, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 215</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 547 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Filing Is Also Required.
   
   - Although a second tier subcontractor must notice its claim of lien using a format substantially similar to that provided in this section, perfection of this lien is not achieved merely upon proper notice; the claim of lien must also be filed pursuant to G.S. 44A-12 before it is considered perfected. Cameron &amp; Barkley Co. v. American Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 434 S.E.2d 632 (1993).
   <br />

       - Trial court's conclusion that a subcontractor's notice of claim of lien was properly made to the record owner was not erroneous because the admissions in the pleadings of an owner and a general contractor showed that the notice and the claim of lien were properly served and filed; in the original answer and answer to the subcontractor's amended complaint, it was admitted that the owner was served by certified mail to its registered agent a copy of the notice of claim of lien and claim of lien, and although there was a minor procedural defect in the filing of the claim of lien, the owner and contractor were not prejudiced in any way merely because the notice of claim of lien was not filed as an attachment to the claim of lien since the owner was put on notice of the claim of lien and understood how the lien arose.

       Appellate court erred in reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the product supplier that found the product supplier was entitled to judgment in the amount specified in its notice of lien sent to the manufacturer; the state constitution and statutory law provided that a materialman was entitled to an adequate lien on the subject matter of the materials supplied, the product supplier sent a notice of lien for a certain amount to the manufacturer after the product supplier became aware that the contractor with whom the manufacturer had contracted was having financial difficulties, the manufacturer nevertheless paid the contractor, instead of the product supplier, shortly before the contractor went bankrupt, and the manufacturer's receipt of notice obligated it to pay the product supplier's claimed lien amount.

       Claim of Lien Insufficient.
   
   - A claim of lien may not serve as a notice of claim of lien because a notice of claim of lien must identify all the parties in the "contractual chain" between the claimant and the owner. Universal Mechanical, Inc. v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 442 S.E.2d 130 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       A claim of lien need only identify the owner, the claimant, and the party with which the claimant contracted. Thus, while plaintiff's claim of lien met the requirements of G.S. 44A-12, the claim of lien did not meet the requirements of this section, because the claim of lien did not name defendant or assert rights available to plaintiff via a notice of claim of lien. Universal Mechanical, Inc. v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 484, 442 S.E.2d 130 (1994).

       Upon receipt of the notice of claim of lien upon funds provided for in this Article, the obligor shall be under a duty to retain any funds subject to the lien or liens upon funds under this Article up to the total amount of such liens upon funds as to which notices of claims of lien upon funds have been received.
      </li>

       If, after the receipt of the notice of claim of lien upon funds to the obligor, the obligor makes further payments to a contractor or subcontractor against whose interest the lien or liens upon funds are claimed, the lien upon funds shall continue upon the funds in the hands of the contractor or subcontractor who received the payment, and in addition the obligor shall be personally liable to the person or persons entitled to liens upon funds up to the amount of such wrongful payments, not exceeding the total claims with respect to which the notice of claim of lien upon funds was received prior to payment.
      </li>
      <li id="t44Aa02s44A-20ol1c">
       If an obligor makes a payment after receipt of notice of claim of lien on funds and incurs personal liability under subsection (b) of this section, the obligor shall be entitled to reimbursement and indemnification from the party receiving such payment.

      <li id="t44Aa02s44A-20ol1d">
       If the obligor is an owner of the property being improved, the lien claimant shall be entitled to a claim of lien upon real property upon the interest of the obligor in the real property to the extent of the owner's personal liability under subsection (b) of this section, which claim of lien on real property shall be enforced only in the manner set forth in G.S. 44A-7 through G.S. 44A-16 and which claim of lien on real property shall be entitled to the same priorities and subject to the same filing requirements and periods of limitation applicable to the contractor. The claim of lien on real property is perfected as of the time set forth in G.S. 44A-10 upon satisfaction of those requirements set forth in G.S. 44A-11. A lien waiver signed by the contractor prior to a subcontractor's perfecting its claim of lien on real property in accordance with G.S. 44A-11 waives the subcontractor's right to enforce the contractor's claim of lien on real property, but does not affect the subcontractor's right to a claim of lien on funds or the subcontractor's right to a claim of lien on real property allowed under this subsection. The claim of lien on real property as provided under this subsection shall be in the form set out in G.S. 44A-12(c) and shall contain, in addition, a copy of the notice of claim of lien upon funds given pursuant to G.S. 44A-19 as an exhibit together with proof of service thereof by affidavit, and shall state the grounds the lien claimant has to believe that the obligor is personally liable for the debt under subsection (b) of this section.

       Lien Under G.S. 44A-18(1) Necessary for Lien Under Subsection (d).
   
   - The existence of a lien upon the realty granted by subsection (d) of this section is dependent upon the existence of a valid lien upon funds pursuant to G.S. 44A-18(1). Mace v. Bryant Constr. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 269 S.E.2d 191 (1980).

       A lien upon realty may arise directly in favor of a first tier subcontractor
   
   under G.S. 44A-18(1) and this section, and the right to such a lien, unlike the right to a lien under G.S. 44A-23, may arise without regard to whether the general contractor has waived its own lien rights. Mace v. Bryant Constr. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 269 S.E.2d 191 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court has long recognized that a lien in favor of a subcontractor may arise either directly under G.S. 44A-18 and G.S. 44A-20 or by subrogation under G.S. 44A-23. Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 587 S.E.2d 87 (2003).

       Receipt of Notice
   
   - Credit union was to retain at least the amount claimed by a subcontractor upon receipt of notice of the subcontractor's lien when it still owed an amount exceeding that under the construction contract, and it could not set off its attorney's fees from the amount owed. Martin Architectural Prods. v. Meridian Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 176, 574 S.E.2d 189 (2002).

       Subcontractor's claim of lien was properly filed because although there was a minor procedural defect in the filing of the claim of lien, an owner and general contractor were not prejudiced in any way merely because the notice of claim of lien was not filed as an attachment to the claim of lien since the owner was put on notice of the claim of lien and understood how the lien arose; the subcontractor failed to state why it was entitled to a lien on real property pursuant to G.S. 44A-20(d), but in the answer of the owner and contractor, it was admitted that the subcontractor made repeated demands for payment on numerous occasions, which were denied based upon the subcontractor's alleged failure to complete all of the work and to complete the work in a workmanlike manner.

       Effect of Filing Claim Before Service of Notice.
   
   - The fact that a lien claim is filed under this section before notice is actually served does not make a difference. Con Co., Inc. v. Wilson Acres Apts., Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 661, 289 S.E.2d 633, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 382</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 206 (1982).

       Once entitlement to a lien has been established, statutory requirements concerning perfection must be liberally construed in favor of the lien claimant.

      <p>
       Harmless Error.
   
   - Assuming that a materialman possessed a valid lien on funds paid to a sublessee, so that the discharge of a lien on the funds was in error, the error was harmless as the materialman could not have received a larger judgment if it had been permitted to pursue a lien on funds against the sublessee than it had already received under a consent judgment.

      <p>
       Subcontractor's Lien Recognized
   
   - Appellate court has long recognized that a lien in favor of a subcontractor may arise either directly under G.S. 44A-18 and G.S. 44A-20 or by subrogation under G.S. 44A-23. Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 587 S.E.2d 87 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontractor is entitled to a lien under this section only by way of subrogation;
   
   his lien rights are dependent upon the lien rights of the general contractor. Mace v. Bryant Constr. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 297, 269 S.E.2d 191 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a subcontractor is entitled to a lien under G.S. 44A-23 only by way of subrogation, a subcontractor's lien rights are dependent upon the lien rights of the general contractor; where the general contractor does not have any lien rights against the owner, the first-tier subcontractor, likewise, has no rights. Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 587 S.E.2d 87 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of Subrogation Where Owner Has Paid Contractor for Specific Labor or Materials.
   
   - Even if the owner has specifically paid the contractor for the labor or materials supplied by the specific unpaid subcontractor who is claiming the lien, that subcontractor retains a right of subrogation, to the extent of his claim, to whatever lien rights the contractor otherwise has in the project. Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).

      </p>
      <p>
       Barring of Subcontractor's Rights by General Contractor.
   
   - No action of the contractor will be effective to prejudice the rights of the subcontractor without his written consent upon the filing of the notice and claim of lien and the commencement of the action; prior to that time, however, the general contractor is free to waive its lien rights and to effectively bar the subcontractor's rights by way of subrogation.

       As Tiered Subcontractor May Enforce Lien of General Contractor Under This Section.
   
   - This section expressly preserves the rights of a first, second or third tier subcontractor to enforce the lien of the general contractor. This construction is supported by the inclusion of the language that upon filing of the notice and claim of lien "no action of the contractor shall be effective to prejudice the rights of the subcontractor without his written consent." This language, not found in G.S. 44A-18, indicates that the legislature intended for the subcontractor to be secured by a mechanic's lien to the full extent of his claim. Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 389 S.E.2d 128, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       A second tier subcontractor has a right to a mechanic's lien against the owner's property when the first tier subcontractor has been fully paid but the owner still owes money to the general contractor. Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 389 S.E.2d 128, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 44A-23 grants to a first tier subcontractor a lien upon real property based upon a right of subrogation to the direct lien of the general contractor on the improved real property as provided in G.S. 44A-8.

      <p>
       Tiered Subcontractor Not Limited to Extent of Claim Under G.S.
   
   44A-18. - While it is true that this section expressly limits the tiered subcontractor's lien only "to the extent of his claim," this language does not mean "to the extent of his claim as permitted by G.S. 44A-18." Electric Supply Co. v. Swain Elec. Co., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 389 S.E.2d 128 (1990), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 651</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 291 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontractor Bound by Defenses Against Contractor.
   
   - If a subcontractor attempts to perfect a lien by subrogation, he is bound by any defenses available against the contractor. Con Co., Inc. v. Wilson Acres Apts., Ltd., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 661, 289 S.E.2d 633, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 382</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 206 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly granted the owners' summary judgment motion as to a subcontractor's claim for enforcement of lien under G.S. 44A-23, as the subcontractor's claim was by way of subrogation; the contractor's claim against the owners had been arbitrated, and after the contractor's claim was set-off against the owners' claim, the contractor was indebted to the owners for corrected and uncompleted work. Watson Elec. Constr. Co. v. Summit Cos., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 587 S.E.2d 87 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiffs' liens on real property were limited
   
   by the amount remaining due on the contract; they were not permitted to assert liens on improved property for the full amount of their claims where that amount greatly exceeded the amount due on the contract. Vulcan Materials Co. v. Fowler Contracting Corp., <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 919, 433 S.E.2d 462, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 565</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 163 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Genuine Issue as to Whether Unpaid Contract Balance Remained
   
   - Summary judgment could not be sustained based on a claim of lien on property because a genuine issue of material fact existed on whether an unpaid contract balance remained between the subcontractor and the supplier, a second-tier subcontractor. Park East Sales, LLC v. Clark-Langley, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 651 S.E.2d 235 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 360</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 736 (2008), review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 360</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 737 (2008).

      <p>
       <b>
        Receipt of Notice.
       </b>
       - Subcontractor's claim of lien was properly filed because although there was a minor procedural defect in the filing of the claim of lien, an owner and general contractor were not prejudiced in any way merely because the notice of claim of lien was not filed as an attachment to the claim of lien since the owner was put on notice of the claim of lien and understood how the lien arose; the subcontractor failed to state why it was entitled to a lien on real property pursuant to G.S. 44A-20(d), but in the answer of the owner and contractor, it was admitted that the subcontractor made repeated demands for payment on numerous occasions, which were denied based upon the subcontractor's alleged failure to complete all of the work and to complete the work in a workmanlike manner.

      <p>
       No Contractual Relationship Established.
   
   - Because there was no contractual relationship between a contractor and a county, the contractor could not enforce a lien on real property conveyed to the county; the contractor executed a waiver of its materialmen's lien rights within a development and sought to enforce a lien on the property for work performed after the lien waiver was signed and after the property was conveyed to the county, but the contractor did not allege a contractual relationship between it and the county, and absent such a relationship, it could not enforce a lien on county real property.

     <p>
      If any contractor or other person receiving payment from an obligor for an improvement to real property or from a purchaser for a conveyance of real property with improvements subject to this Article or to Article 3 of this Chapter shall knowingly furnish to such obligor, purchaser, or to a lender who obtains a security interest in said real property, or to a title insurance company insuring title to such real property, a false written statement of the sums due or claimed to be due for labor or material furnished at the site of improvements to such real property, then such contractor, subcontractor or other person shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Upon conviction and in the event the court shall grant any defendant a suspended sentence, the court may in its discretion include as a condition of such suspension a provision that the defendant shall reimburse the party who suffered loss on such conditions as the court shall determine are proper.
     </p>
     <p>
      The elements of the offense herein stated are the furnishing of the false written statement with knowledge that it is false and the subsequent or simultaneous receipt of payment from an obligor or purchaser by the person signing the document, a person directing another to sign the document, or any person or entity for whom the document was signed. In any criminal prosecution hereunder it shall not be necessary for the State to prove that the obligor, purchaser, lender or title insurance company relied upon the false statement or that any person was injured thereby.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition to the criminal sanctions created by this section, conduct constituting the offense herein stated and causing actual harm to any person by any licensed contractor or qualifying party, as that term is used in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.087.html" target="_blank">Chapter 87</a></cite> of the General Statutes, shall constitute deceit and misconduct subject to disciplinary action under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.087.html" target="_blank">Chapter 87</a></cite> of the General Statutes, including revocation, suspension, or restriction of a license or the ability to act as a qualifying party for a license.

     <p>
      A lien authorized by this Part attaches to the commercial real estate only when the lien claimant files a timely notice of the lien conforming to the requirements of G.S. 44A-24.5 and this section in the office of the clerk of superior court. A notice of lien is timely if it is filed after the claimant's performance under the written agreement for broker services and before the conveyance or transfer of the commercial real estate which is the subject of the lien, except that in the case of a lease or transfer of a nonfreehold interest, the notice of a lien shall be filed no later than 90 days following the tenant's possession of the commercial real estate or no later than 60 days following any date or dates set out in the written agreement for broker services for subsequent payment or payments. When a notice of a lien is filed more than 30 days preceding the date for settlement or possession set out in an offer to purchase, sales contract, or lease, which establishes the broker's claim of performance, the lien shall be available only upon grounds of the owner's breach of the written agreement for broker services.

       Right of Materialman Who Furnishes Material to Subcontractor to Recover.
   
   - Neither actual delivery of material to a prime contract job site nor incorporation of the material into the work affects a materialman's right to recover under the contractor's payment bond; in order for a materialman who furnishes a subcontractor with materials for use on a public project to recover against a prime contractor's payment bond pursuant to this Article, it is only necessary that the materialman has sold and delivered the materials to the subcontractor in good faith and under the reasonable belief that these materials were for ultimate use under the prime contract. Syro Steel Co. v. Hubbell Hwy. Signs, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 424 S.E.2d 208 (1993).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where there was evidence that a materialman delivered material to a subcontractor in good faith and under the reasonable belief that the material was intended for use on the construction project, and where the subcontractor failed to present any evidence indicating that the materialman should have had reasonable grounds to believe that materials shipped to the subcontractor's warehouse were not intended for the project site, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of the materialman against the contractor's payment bond for the materials shipped to the project site and to the warehouse.

       Assignee of Subcontractor Was Also a Subcontractor.

       Withholding of Prime Contractor's Funds Unnecessary.
   
   - Even in view of the required statutory contract payment bond, the provisions of Article 32 of the general contract conditions of state construction contracts (which provides for the withholding of the prime contractor's funds upon notice of a claim by the subcontractor against the prime contractor) are not necessary; since the subcontractor is adequately protected by the contract payment bond required by Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.044A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 44A</a></cite>, there is no legal requirement for withholding such funds.

       Purpose of employing "final settlement" as yardstick is that it provides definite time,
   
   fixed by public record and readily ascertainable, after which subcontractors must bring suit. Pyco Supply Co. v. American Centennial Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 354 S.E.2d 360 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 435</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 380 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       For discussion of meaning of "final settlements,"
   
   see Pyco Supply Co. v. American Centennial Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 354 S.E.2d 360 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 435</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 380 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court does not find that a final completion requirement needs to be implied into G.S. 44A-28(b) since the doctrine of substantial completion adequately addresses concerns that there could be a final ascertainment of the amount due immediately on the execution of a contract; certainly a project must be substantially complete before a governmental agency is capable of administratively fixing the amount it is bound to pay, however, the North Carolina legislature does not expressly require the contract to be 100-percent completed before the government may determine the final settlement, and the appellate court does not import this language into North Carolina law. Cencomp, Inc. v. Webcon, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 579 S.E.2d 482 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is true that the government's retainage of funds casts doubt on whether its payment was intended to be a genuinely "final payment" for purposes of determining a final settlement under G.S. 44A-28(b); however, final payment and final settlement are not synonymous, and while retainage directly affects final payment, it does not have a similar impact on final settlement. A governmental entity may administratively fix the amount it is bound to pay, and then retain a portion of that payment to ensure not only that the contractor completes the entire project, including the punch-list, but also that no liens are outstanding. Cencomp, Inc. v. Webcon, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 579 S.E.2d 482 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction Contract is Prime Contract.
   
   - A complaint which was filed in the county where some portion of a subcontract was performed should have been removed for improper venue to the county where the prime contract was performed because the statutory definitions, the plain language, context and federal case law support an interpretation that "the construction contract" addressed in this section is the prime contract and only the prime contract. McClure Estimating Co. v. H.G. Reynolds Co., <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 176, 523 S.E.2d 144 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Limitation Period Commences to Run.
   
   - Subsection (b) is a statute of repose; therefore the limitation period contained therein runs from the longer period of one year from the last day on which labor was performed or material was furnished, or one year from the date of final settlement with the contractor. Tipton &amp; Young Constr. Co. v. Blue Ridge Structure Co., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 446 S.E.2d 603, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 257</cite>, 456 S.E.2d 308 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subcontractors' suit against the contractor's insurer was time-barred under G.S. 44A-28(b) where: (1) the contractor had sent a final bill on the project to the City; (2) the project engineer had advised the City that the work was substantially complete and that final payment (less a retainage) should be made, with the retainage balance to be paid after the City was satisfied that the project was 100-percent complete; (3) the City wrote the contractor a check for the final amount less the retainer more than one year before the suit was filed; (4) the City's Finance Director was confident that the final sum had been determined even though a retainage had been kept; and (5) the City's engineering technician testified that contractors submitted a final bill and that the retainage was usually paid one to three months later.

       Contractual Reduction of Statutory Limitation Time Disregarded.
   
   - Where the contractual provisions of a bond sought to shorten the limitation period to the minimum allowed under subsection (b), but the statute provides for the longer period, the contractual limits set out in the bond would be disregarded to the extent they would reduce the limitation period allowed under subsection (b). Pyco Supply Co. v. American Centennial Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 354 S.E.2d 360 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 435</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 380 (1988).

       Parties cannot contract to shorten the one-year limitations period
   
   for payment bonds required by the public bond statute. However, in contrast to the provisions governing payment bonds, the public bond statute does not specify a limitations period for performance bonds. Town of Pineville v. Atkinson/Dyer/Watson Architects, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 442 S.E.2d 73 (1994).

       Amended Complaint Related Back to Filing of Original Complaint.
   
   - Where supplier attached contract two to its original complaint, where supplier amended the complaint to state a claim which included contract four, and where the original complaint and amended complaint, viewed together, evidenced the intention of the supplier to collect all outstanding sums owed by general contractor to supplier for material supplied in connection with any bonded contract on which surety for general contractor was liable, allegations in original complaint were sufficient to put surety on notice of all of supplier's claims, and the amended complaint related back to the original complaint; Court of Appeals erred in holding that since one year limitation in subsection (b) was a substantive element of the claim that had gone unsatisfied, the amended complaint could not relate back to date of the filing of the original complaint.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In any suit brought or defended under the provisions of Article 2 or Article 3 of this Chapter, the presiding judge may allow a reasonable attorneys' fee to the attorney representing the prevailing party. This attorneys' fee is to be taxed as part of the court costs and be payable by the losing party upon a finding that there was an unreasonable refusal by the losing party to fully resolve the matter which constituted the basis of the suit or the basis of the defense. For purposes of this section, "prevailing party" is a party plaintiff or third party plaintiff who obtains a judgment of at least fifty percent (50%) of the monetary amount sought in a claim or is a party defendant or third party defendant against whom a claim is asserted which results in a judgment of less than fifty percent (50%) of the amount sought in the claim defended. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event an offer of judgment is served in accordance with G.S. 1A-1, Rule 68, a "prevailing party" is an offeree who obtains judgment in an amount more favorable than the last offer or is an offeror against whom judgment is rendered in an amount less favorable than the last offer.

      <p>
       Discretion of Trial Judge.
   
   - Where the trial judge found as a fact that there was no unreasonable refusal to resolve the dispute, his determination not to award attorney fees was not an abuse of discretion. Barrett Kays &amp; Assocs. v. Colonial Bldg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 525, 500 S.E.2d 108 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction.
   
   - G.S. 44A-35 is remedial in nature and must be liberally construed. Martin &amp; Loftis Clearing &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Saieed Constr. Sys. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 608 S.E.2d 124 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prevailing Party.
   
   - G.S. 44A-35 provides a specific definition of what constitutes a prevailing party when an offer of judgment is made by stating that there is no prevailing party when such an offer is made and accepted. Martin &amp; Loftis Clearing &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Saieed Constr. Sys. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 608 S.E.2d 124 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unjustifiable Refusal.
   
   - In a contractor's suit against homeowners for payment, a trial court did not abuse the court's discretion by awarding attorney fees without first finding an unjustifiable refusal to resolve the matter out of court because (1) the court found the homeowners' unreasonable refusal to resolve the basis of the suit, and (2) the court's findings showed the award was the product of a reasoned decision. Brown's Builders Supply, Inc. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 8, 769 S.E.2d 653 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Award Proper.
   
   - Grassing subcontractor was properly awarded attorney's fees under G.S. 44A-35 as an erosion subcontractor's claims that the payment bond obligations were not triggered since there was not a default, and that the erosion subcontractor was not a party to the payment bond were misplaced because the trial court found that the grassing subcontractor was the prevailing party in the breach of contract suit and that the erosion subcontractor unreasonably refused to resolve the matter. S. Seeding Serv. v. W.C. English, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 90, 735 S.E.2d 829 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grassing subcontractor was properly awarded attorney's fees under G.S. 44A-35 because: (1) the grassing subcontractor was not appropriately paid for work it performed for an erosion subcontractor; (2) the grassing subcontractor took the matter to trial; (3) the sureties and the erosion subcontractor lost at trial; (4) the erosion subcontractor was found to have unreasonably refused to settle because of actions taken or not taken prior to judgment; and (5) the erosion subcontractor's claim that it was not obligated to pay the equitable adjustment funds until the trial court entered the judgment and thus did not unreasonably refuse to settle was rejected. S. Seeding Serv. v. W.C. English, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 90, 735 S.E.2d 829 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       When, in a builder's suit against a homeowner to enforce a lien, the homeowner was granted summary judgment, the builder showed no abuse of discretion in granting the homeowner attorneys' fees because (1) the builder submitted no transcripts, (2) the trial court made requisite findings based on the parties' stated actions at mediation, when the homeowner rejected the builder's settlement demand, affidavits and argument, and (3) the homeowner prevailed. R &amp; L Constr. of Mt. Airy, LLC v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 194, 770 S.E.2d 698 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Award of Attorneys' Fees Held Error.
   
   - In a breach of contract suit wherein plaintiff subcontractor accepted an offer of judgment made by defendant general contractor, the suit was settled and the trial court erred by granting an award of attorneys' fees to the subcontractor; when an offer of judgment is involved, no prevailing or losing party exists and an award of attorneys' fees is precluded under G.S. 44A-35. Martin &amp; Loftis Clearing &amp; Grading, Inc. v. Saieed Constr. Sys. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 608 S.E.2d 124 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting a builder attorney's fees pursuant to G.S. 44A-35 because the trial court awarded the builder attorney fees as the prevailing party, but the builder could not prevail within the meaning of G.S. 44A-35 because the court of appeals concluded that trial court erred in granting the builder a lien on owners' real property on the theory of quantum meruit; to establish a valid claim of lien under G.S. 44A-8, an enforceable contract has to exist between the parties. Waters Edge Builders, LLC v. Longa, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 715 S.E.2d 193 (2011).

     <p>
      The owner of a self-service storage facility has a lien upon all personal property stored at the facility for rent, expenses necessary for the preservation of the personal property, and expenses reasonably incurred in the sale or other disposition of the personal property pursuant to this Article. This lien shall not have priority over any security interest which is perfected at the time the occupant stores the property at the self-service storage facility. For purposes of this Article, to identify an existing security interest in stored property, the owner shall conduct an online search for Uniform Commercial Code financing statements filed with the Office of the Secretary of State in the name of the occupant.
