            Constitutionality of Fees. - The fees prescribed are for the expenses of enforcing the Chapter, which is necessary to the public health and welfare. They are not imposed for revenue, and the payment of the barber's license tax under the Revenue Act does
            not affect the obligation to pay the fees prescribed by this Chapter. Assessment of the fees thereunder is constitutional. State v. Lockey, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 551</cite>, 152 S.E. 693 (1930).

        <p>
            Imposition of Civil Penalties on Non-Licensees. - Trial court erred by concluding the State of North Carolina Board of Barber Examiners did not have the statutory authority to impose fines on the barbershop owner because the imposition of civil penalties
            on non-licensees was reasonably necessary for the Board to serve its purpose of preventing non-licensees from engaging in barbering. Kindsgrab v. State Bd. of Barber Examiners, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 564, 763
            S.E.2d 913 (2014).
