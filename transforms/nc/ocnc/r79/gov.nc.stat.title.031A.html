                        The apparent purpose of the full statute is to bar the benefits of certain types of property rights and interests otherwise accruing to a person but for his wrongful acts or a divorce or annulment. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 244</cite>,
                        362 S.E.2d 542 (1987).

        Abandonment.
       </b> - Assuming arguendo that the clerk could properly re-date the assignment and deficiency judgment, the trial court erred in concluding that appellant willfully and without just cause abandoned the decedent; to the extent
                        that appellant's divorce filings indicated a willful desire to end her relationship, the evidence did not support a conclusion of abandonment without just cause. Appellant was not the wrongdoer and was not to suffer the consequence
                        of being barred her spousal rights. In re Estate of Meetze, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right to Take under Will Not Forfeited by Abandonment. - The right of the widow to take under her husband's will that which he saw fit to bequeath or devise to her is not among the rights which this section declares forfeited by her abandonment of him.
                        Abbott v. Abbott, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 579</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 39 (1967).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Divorce Does Not Annul or Revoke Designation of Insurance Beneficiary. - Neither G.S. 50-11 which provides that "all rights arising out of the marriage shall cease and determine," nor this section which bars rights to "any rights or interests in the property
                        of the other spouse" discloses a legislative intent that divorce should annul or revoke the beneficiary designation in a garden-variety insurance certificate. DeVane v. Travelers Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite>                        247, 174 S.E.2d 146 (1970).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Presumption of Adultery. - Adultery is presumed if the following can be shown: (1) the adulterous disposition, or inclination, of the parties; and (2) the opportunity created to satisfy their mutual adulterous inclinations. In re Trogdon,
                        <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 143</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 897 (1991).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wife's Behavior as Inference of Adultery. - A married woman's refusal to testify about the nature of her relationship with two unmarried men, with whom she admitted cohabiting, and her failure to refute the charge of adultery logically gave rise to an
                        inference of adultery. In re Trogdon, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 143</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 897 (1991).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Living in Adultery." - Considering the legislative history and the purpose of this section, "living in adultery" means a spouse engages in repeated acts of adultery within a reasonable period of time preceding the death of her spouse; therefore, "living
                        in adultery" requires a showing of something more than "committing adultery," or a single act of adultery, and something less than "residing" in adultery because the latter construction would permit spouses to engage in habitual
                        adultery with those with whom they do not reside and nevertheless be qualified to administer their decedent spouse's estate under section 28A-6-1. In re Estate of Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                        564, 528 S.E.2d 618 (2000).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subdivision (b)(6) is inapplicable to separation agreements entered into by parties contemplating a separation or divorce from a valid marriage. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 244</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 542 (1987).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Negligence Is Not Ground for Forfeiture. - The surviving spouse does not lose his right of inheritance because the claim arose on account of the negligence of the surviving spouse since negligence is not one of the grounds for forfeiture of marital rights
                        as set out in this section. Wilson v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 201 S.E.2d 55 (1973).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure to Provide Support Tantamount to Abandonment. - Where the husband made his wife leave, or where she had to leave because he would not give her anything to eat, it was held that his conduct amounted to abandonment. High v. Bailey,
                        <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 70</cite>, 12 S.E. 45 (1890), construing former G.S. 28-12.
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Summary judgment was appropriate for the defendant under this section where the evidence failed to support a finding of willful abandonment of the deceased, and that any failure to care for, or cohabit with, her was due to the advanced age and deteriorating
                        health of both spouses. Meares v. Jernigan, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 530 S.E.2d 883 (2000).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Proceeding to set aside invalid divorce decree is not barred by death of one of the spouses where property rights are involved. Allred v. Tucci, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 354 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied,
                        <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 166</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 47 (1987).

                        Wrongful Death Action - In a wrongful death action, the real parties in interest were the beneficiaries as defined in the Wrongful Death Act, who were the same persons who would have received property had the decedent died intestate; where a widow, who
                        was the decedent's sole intestate beneficiary, had abandoned the decedent before his death, she was not entitled to a wrongful death recovery, and since the remaining beneficiaries did not succeed to a full 100 percent, but only
                        received their original percentage, there were no beneficiaries to the wrongful death claim. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 571 S.E.2d 668 (2002), cert.

                        Where decedent's ex-spouse abandoned her interest in the decedent's estate at the time of death, decedent's siblings were entitled to share in any wrongful death proceeds, distribution was dictated by the laws of intestacy, and decedent's sister, as administratrix
                        had standing to file the action. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 113</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 543 (2004).

                        Intestate Succession Act Modified by Chapter. - When the legislature, in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa18s28A-18-2" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-18-2</a></cite>, provided that the proceeds of an action
                        for wrongful death "shall be disposed of as provided in the Intestate Succession Act," and when it provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.097.html#t97a01s97-40" target="_blank">G.S. 97-40</a></cite> that the
                        order of priority among claimants to death benefits payable under the Workers' Compensation Act "shall be governed by the general law applicable to the distribution of the personal estate of persons dying intestate," it had in
                        mind the same law; i.e., the Intestate Succession Act as modified by this Chapter, entitled, "Acts Barring Property Rights." Williford v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 506</cite>, 219 S.E.2d 220 (1975).

                        Construction. - G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from taking anything from the abandoned child's intestate estate, was ambiguous because nowhere in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 31A</a></cite>                        was the term "child" defined, nor was the meaning of the term clear from its context, so "child" here could reasonably mean either a minor offspring or an offspring of any age. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>,
                        586 S.E.2d 258 (2003).

                    <p>
                        Meaning of Abandonment. - Abandonment is defined as any willful or intentional conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. Lessard v. Lessard,
                        <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 334 S.E.2d 475 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 546</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 522 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Logically, G.S. 31A-2, prohibiting a parent who abandoned a child from taking anything from the child's intestate estate, had to apply to an abandonment that initially occurred while the child was a minor as a parent could not abandon an emancipated or
                        adult child when the parent had no further responsibility for the child. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258 (2003).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Applicability to Estate of Adult Child. - This section applies to the estate of any son or daughter of an individual, even after that child has reached the age of majority. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite>                        646, 547 S.E.2d 483 (2001), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 727</cite>, 550 S.E.2d 779.

                    <p>
                        Abandonment has been defined as willful neglect and refusal to perform the natural and legal obligations of parental care and support; if a parent withholds his presence, his love, his care, and the opportunity to display filial affection, and willfully
                        neglects to lend support and maintenance, such parent relinquishes all parental claims and abandons the child. Lessard v. Lessard, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 334 S.E.2d 475 (1985), aff'd,
                        <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 546</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 522 (1986).

                        North Carolina Supreme Court had implicitly held that G.S. 31A-2 applied to a dispute as to a father's rights to share in his daughter's estate even though she was not a minor at the time of her death. In re Estate of Lunsford,
                        <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 585 S.E.2d 245 (2003).

                        North Carolina General Assembly adequately demonstrated an unwillingness to allow an abandoning parent to take from an abandoned adult child as the result of a mechanical application of the rules of intestate succession. McKinney v. Richitelli,
                        <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258 (2003).

                    <p>
                        When a deceased child's mother filed a declaratory judgment action against the child's father, seeking a determination of the parties' rights to share in the child's estate, including the proceeds of a wrongful death suit on the child's behalf, under
                        G.S. 31A-2, because the father did not support or communicate with the child from age four until almost age 20, the father's motion to dismiss, under G.S. 1A-1, Rule 12(b)(6), was properly denied; while the father resumed support
                        of and contact with the child before the child's death, support had to be resumed at least one year before the end of the father's legal obligation to support the child, which ended at age 18, to apply the exception to G.S. 31A-2's
                        preclusion, found in G.S. 31A-2(1), so that exception did not apply to the father. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legislative intent behind G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from sharing in the abandoned child's intestate estate, was both to discourage parents from shirking their responsibility of support to their children and to prevent an abandoning parent
                        from reaping an undeserved bonanza, and if G.S. 31A-2 had no application once a child reached majority, a parent who had abandoned his or her child would nevertheless automatically inherit if the still-abandoned child died intestate
                        after reaching the age of 18 so such an interpretation would frustrate the statute's purpose and effectively forgive the abandoning parent's dereliction; G.S. 31A-2 applied to any abandoned child dying intestate regardless of the
                        child's age at death. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Critical inquiry as to G.S. 31A-2(1), allowing a parent who had abandoned a child to share in the child's intestate estate if the parent had resumed supporting the child, was not whether a parent could resume a relationship with a child, but whether a
                        parent resumed its care and maintenance at least one year prior to the death of the child and continued the same until its death so the exception required that the parent resume both the care and maintenance of the child, and these
                        requirements could not be read in the disjunctive; while "care" pertained to love and concern for the child, "maintenance" referred to the financial support of a child during minority, and North Carolina jurisprudence established
                        that the authority of a court to require support for a normal child ceased when the legal obligation to support no longer existed so the parents' duty to support ceased upon emancipation, and the age of emancipation was precisely
                        fixed at 18. McKinney v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from sharing in the abandoned child's intestate estate, pertained to the estate of a child of any age, and under the logic of that analysis - that a parent who abandoned a child should benefit from the death
                        of the child only if the parent had resumed a parental relationship with the child - an abandoning parent who sought to come under the exception in G.S. 31A-2(1), allowing an abandoning parent to share in the abandoned child's
                        intestate estate if support of the child was resumed, had to renew both the care and the maintenance of the child during the child's minority, when care and maintenance were most valuable; under the terms of the statute, the care
                        and maintenance had to continue for a year before the child's death so, in order to benefit from this provision, a parent had to renew such care and maintenance at least one year before the child reached the age of 18. McKinney
                        v. Richitelli, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 483</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 258 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legislative intent behind G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from inheriting from an abandoned child, is both to discourage parents from shirking their responsibility of support to their children and to prevent an abandoning parent from reaping
                        an undeserved bonanza, and the general assembly demonstrated its unwillingness to allow an abandoning parent to take from an abandoned adult child as the result of a mechanical application of the rules of intestate succession.
                        In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Willful intent is an integral part of abandonment and this is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence. Lessard v. Lessard, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 334 S.E.2d 475 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 546</cite>,

                        Abandoning Parent Does Not Share Death Benefits under G.S. 97-38. - Where the father wilfully abandoned the care and maintenance of the deceased during the latter's minority, this section provides that the father loses all right to intestate succession
                        in the distribution of the personal estate of his intestate deceased child and consequently, he does not share in the death benefits for which the employer or its carrier is liable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.097.html#t97a01s97-38" target="_blank">G.S. 97-38</a></cite>.

                        Operative language in G.S. 31A-2, precluding an abandoning parent from inheriting from an abandoned child, is nearly identical to that in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.097.html#t97a01s97-40" target="_blank">G.S. 97-40</a></cite>,
                        precluding the receipt of workers' compensation benefits by an abandoning parent due to the death of an abandoned child, as both statutes provide that a parent who has abandoned the "care and maintenance" of a child loses the right
                        to receive a specified benefit upon the child's death, and both provide an exception when the parent has resumed the "care and maintenance" of the child at least one year prior to the child's death or majority. In re Estate of

                    <p>
                        Construction of Exception - Exception contained in G.S. 31A-2(2) must be construed in accordance with the policy underlying <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 31A</a></cite>; the exception
                        contained in G.S. 31A-2(2) essentially states that if a court takes away custody of a child and decides the specifics of support, then a parent should not be denied the right to participate in intestate succession if he limits
                        his role in his child's life to the parameters set out by a court. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 585 S.E.2d 245 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Exception in G.S. 31A-2(2) to precluding an abandoning parent from inheriting from an abandoned child essentially states that a parent should not be denied the right to participate in intestate succession if he limits his role in his child's life to the
                        parameters set out by a court, at least when the abandoning parent complies with the express terms of a court order requiring contribution to the support of the child, so an exception to the general rule of disinheritance is justified
                        under such circumstances, because the legislative intent underlying G.S. 31A-2 is not effectuated by the disinheritance of a non-custodial parent who provides the court-ordered level of material support; put simply, a parent who
                        limits his role in his child's life to the parameters set out by a court has not shirked his responsibility to that child. so, construing G.S. 31A-2(2) to apply it only to a parent who was ordered to provide support effectuates
                        the legislative intent behind that exception. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366 (2005).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a parent voluntarily provides adequate "care and maintenance" to a child, for purposes of G.S. 31A-2, that parent cannot be said to have abandoned the child in the first instance, and, as an exception to the general rule of disinheritance, G.S. 31A-2(2)
                        comes into play only when a parent has failed to provide care and support of his or her own volition, so the exception provides that a parent should not be penalized for his or her failure to exceed the terms of a judicial child
                        support order, and the statute should not be applied to the disadvantage of a parent who voluntarily provides adequate care and support. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>,
                        610 S.E.2d 366 (2005).

                    <p>
                        When a father was not ordered to pay support for his child, when custody of the child was awarded to the child's mother, and the father did not voluntarily provide an adequate level of support for the child during the 17 years following the mother's and
                        father's divorce, when the child died, the father was precluded from sharing in the proceeds of the child's estate because he wilfully abandoned her, and the exception to such preclusion in G.S. 31A-2(2), which applied to non-custodial
                        parents who complied with court orders to support a child, did not apply to him because he was not ordered to pay support for the child, and he did not voluntarily provide an adequate amount of such support. In re Estate of Lunsford,
                        <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Exception in Subsection (2) Applied - Trial court erred in concluding that a father did not fall within the scope of G.S. 31A-2(2) where: (1) the father was deprived of custody under the divorce decree, (2) the decree did not grant the father any visitation
                        rights, and (3) because the district court in its divorce judgment considered the issue of child support but elected not to require the father to pay support, the father complied with the only order in existence addressing the
                        question of child support. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 585 S.E.2d 245 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        G.S. 31A-2(2) provides that an abandoning parent may inherit from an abandoned child if the parent has substantially complied with all orders of the court requiring contribution to the support of the child, so, by its express language, this statutory
                        exception to the preclusion of an abandoning parent's inheritance from an abandoned child may not be invoked where a court order has not "required" the payment of child support. In re Estate of Lunsford,
                        <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366 (2005).

                        Abandonment Found. - Where respondent/mother never provided child support for her daughters, rarely visited them, and voluntarily relinquished custody a year before a divorce judgment, a jury could conclude that she had abandoned her daughters. Hixson
                        v. Krebs, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 523 S.E.2d 684 (1999).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A father abandoned his daughter and, therefore, could not inherit from her, where he paid no more than $100 toward her support after the divorce and visited her less than a dozen times over a 17-year period. In re Estate of Lunsford,
                        <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 547 S.E.2d 483 (2001), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 727</cite>, 550 S.E.2d 779.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's findings of fact supported its conclusion that a father wilfully abandoned the care and maintenance of his child, under G.S. 31A-2, because, even assuming the child and her mother refused to accept the father's occasional offers of financial
                        assistance, the trial court could reasonably find that the father's sporadic contacts with his daughter over 17 years did not show the degree of "presence," "love," "care," and "opportunity to display filial affection" that defined
                        non-abandoning parents. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 382</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 366 (2005).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        No Abandonment Found - Trial court erred in concluding that a father had willfully abandoned his child for purposes of G.S. 31A-2 where: (1) the mother was awarded sole custody of the child in a divorce decree that did not address visitation rights or
                        any child support obligation of the father, (2) the father offered to help pay for the child's expenses on occasion, but his offers were refused by the mother, (3) the father sporadically visited the child, (4) as the child grew
                        older, either the child or the father would initiate phone calls, visits, or other relational contact, and (5) the father attended the child's high school graduation, and both had initiated plans for furthering their father-daughter
                        relationship. In re Estate of Lunsford, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 585 S.E.2d 245 (2003).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a mother alleged a father's abandonment of a child deprived the father of a share of the child's intestate estate, it was no error to grant the father's motion in limine to bar expert testimony on child-raising costs because such testimony was likely
                        to confuse the jury, given the existence of child support orders. Shearin v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 42, 812 S.E.2d 381 (2018).

                        Jury Instruction on Legislative Intent Not Required. - When a mother alleged a father's abandonment of a child deprived the father of a share of the child's intestate estate, a jury instruction on the legislative intent behind G.S. 31A-2 was not required
                        because the jury was adequately instructed on the substance of the statute. Shearin v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 42, 812 S.E.2d 381 (2018).

                        The public policy sought to be fostered by the enactment of this Article is predicated upon the theory that the murderer himself will not profit by his own wrongdoing; however, this principle does not extend to those related to the slayer. Misenheimer

                        of killing deceased, she was nonetheless barred by the common law from receiving the proceeds of deceased's life insurance, where the jury found by a preponderance of the evidence that she had killed him or procured his death.

                        Estate of Decedent Determined at Date of Her Actual Death. - This section makes no attempt artificially to alter the date of the death of the decedent but provides instead that the actual date of death of the slayer is to be disregarded. Therefore, if
                        the language of the statute is followed, the estate of the decedent is determined at the date of her actual death, and the law calls the roll of the class immediately as of that time; those who can then answer, take. Porth v. Porth,

                        words "the estate of the wife" as the same were used in former G.S. 31A-5(2) meant the estate of the murdered wife as the same came into existence at the instant of her death, and the title to the entireties property at that moment
                        passed to those persons who would be entitled to succeed to her interest in such property as of the moment of her death if she had in fact survived her husband, subject only to recognized right to "hold" the property during his

                        Where a husband has taken out a policy of life insurance on his own life with his wife as beneficiary and has feloniously killed his wife and then himself, under this section (former G.S. 28-10), his heirs may not claim under him the proceeds of the policy,
                        since the law will not allow a man or those claiming under him to benefit by his own wrong, and the proceeds of the policy are descendible to the next of kin of the wife and not to the husband's heirs at law. Parker v. Potter,

                        Heir Murdering Ancestor Excluded from Beneficial Interest in Estate. - The fact that this (former G.S. 28-10) and other sections forfeiting a murder's interest in the estate of his victim apply only to the relation of husband and wife does not deprive
                        equity of the power of excluding an heir who has murdered his ancestor from all beneficial interest in the estate of his victim. Garner v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 160</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 845

        Wrongful Act Bars Husband from Share of Wrongful Death Recovery.

                        This Chapter does not wholly supplant the common law, which prevents a beneficiary in a policy of life insurance whose culpable negligence caused the death of the insured from collecting the proceeds of the policy. Quick v. United Benefit Life Ins. Co.,

                        Public Policy Applied - Father's failure to pay child support when a divorce court considered the issue of child support but decided not to order him to pay child support was consistent with the only pertinent order and with the mother's wishes and could
                        not be deemed wrong in the sense of the public policy expressed in G.S. 31A-15 and could not prevent the father from sharing in his daughter's intestate estate under G.S. 31A-2(2). In re Estate of Lunsford,

                        If the party seeking to disqualify the beneficiary cannot proceed under this Chapter, as when the jury in the criminal proceeding finds the wrongdoer guilty of involuntary manslaughter, then his only remaining remedy is to proceed under the common law.
