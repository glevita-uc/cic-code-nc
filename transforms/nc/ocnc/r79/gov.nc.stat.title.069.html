However, before said fire protection district change is approved by the county commissioners, notice shall be given once a week for two successive calendar weeks in a newspaper having general circulation in said district, and notice shall be posted at the courthouse door in each county affected, and at three public places in the area to be included, said notices inviting interested citizens to appear at a designated meeting of said county commissioners, said notice to be published the first time and posted not less than fifteen days prior to the date fixed for hearing before the county commissioners.

        Meaning of "Owner" and "Majority of Owners".

       - The legislative intent was to include nonresident property owners, and the word "owner" should be construed to mean "resident and nonresident owners" of the territory to be included. "Majority of the owners" refers to persons and entities owning real estate in the territory. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Paul S. Messick, Jr., Chatham County Attorney, 50 N.C.A.G. 74 (1981).
