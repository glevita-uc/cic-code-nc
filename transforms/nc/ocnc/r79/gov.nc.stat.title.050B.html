                        the course of the relationship. A casual acquaintance or ordinary fraternization between persons in a business or social context is not a dating relationship.

            Applicability of Chapter. - This Chapter did not become effective until October 1, 1979, and applies only to acts of domestic violence occurring on or after that date. Story v. Story, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 291 S.E.2d

        <p>
            Acts of Domestic Violence When Considering Child's Best Interests. - Although a mother voluntarily dismissed her domestic violence complaint at the time a memorandum of judgment was entered regarding custody, a trial court did not abuse its discretion
            in considering the claim when the father filed a motion for modification of custody, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.7, because "acts of domestic violence between the parties" was one of the factors the trial court was to consider, pursuant to G.S.
            50-13.2(a), when making findings as to the best interests of the child. Balawejder v. Balawejder, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 721 S.E.2d 679 (2011).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            This Chapter does not establish an affirmative duty on the part of law enforcement agencies to protect victims or threatened victims of domestic violence upon request; its effect is limited to enabling such persons to more readily obtain the court's protection
            and such assistance as any local agency approached sees fit to give. Braswell v. Braswell, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 231, 390 S.E.2d 752, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 363</cite>, 410
            S.E.2d 897 (1991).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            This Chapter does not establish victims of domestic violence as a protected class of persons or extend employment security status to such persons, and domestic violence victims were not members of a protected class or otherwise entitled to special treatment;
            the termination of the at will employment of a domestic violence victim did not violate public policy, and a trial court's dismissal of his wrongful termination suit was affirmed. Imes v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite>            668, 594 S.E.2d 397 (2004), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 182</cite>, 606 S.E.2d 117 (2004).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Personal Relationship. - Term "over time", construed broadly, categorically does not preclude a short-term romantic relationship, from ever being considered a "dating relationship"; instead, the question of what constitutes the minimum conduct to establish
            a dating relationship is necessarily fact sensitive and thus warrants a factor approach rather than a definitional approach. Therefore, a trial court properly entered a domestic violence protective order against a former boyfriend because
            it determined that the parties had a dating relationship, even though it only lasted for 3 weeks, because the parties' relationship exceeded the minimal social interpersonal bonding of casual acquaintances or of contacts through ordinary fraternization.
            Thomas v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 773 S.E.2d 900 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Weapons surrendered under a domestic violence protective order should have been returned because convictions for stalking and communicating threats did not constitute "misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence," and federal law did not preclude the gun
            owner from having or possessing a firearm, even if the owner and a victim were in a "personal relationship." Underwood v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 781 S.E.2d 295 (2015).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     In Loco Parentis.
    </b> - Vacating of a domestic violence protection order, and remand of the case for entry of a new order, was appropriate because the findings of fact did not support the trial court's conclusion that the stepparent - who provided support
            and maintenance to the stepchild - never acted in loco parentis to the stepchild, rendering the stepparent unable to obtain an order against the stepchild. Gibson v. Lopez, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
            Subjective Fear of Imminent Serious Bodily Injury - This section imposes a subjective test, rather than an objective reasonableness test, to determine whether an act of domestic violence has occurred. Brandon v. Brandon, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite>            646, 513 S.E.2d 589 (1999).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Evidence of Imminent Serious Bodily Injury - The evidence supported a finding that the husband threatened imminent serious bodily injury to the wife, where a deputy had to stop the husband from entering a rental house owned by the parties, the husband
            threatened the wife in the deputies' presence, and his subsequent threat to kill her was relayed to the wife. Brandon v. Brandon, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 513 S.E.2d 589 (1999).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Fear of Continued Harassment Supported Protective Order for Domestic Violence. - Protective order against a husband for acts of domestic violence was supported by the evidence as, inter alia, the husband yelled at the wife "Would you like to hurt me?
            Would you like to kill and hit me? Would that make you feel better?," the husband banged a stapler on a counter, threw a water bottle in the wife's direction, and refused to leave their jointly-owned business during the late night hours, and
            the wife was afraid of the husband and thought he was "out of control." Wornstaff v. Wornstaff, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 634 S.E.2d 567 (2006), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 230</cite>, 641 S.E.2d
            301 (2007).
        </p>
        <p>
            In a case involving the issuance of a domestic violence protective order, there was sufficient evidence that there was a fear of continued harassment that caused the victim substantial distress, even though the victim only testified about the contents
            of one voicemail. The evidence showed that the victim broke off the relationship due to fear, the boyfriend continued to contact her repeatedly, despite instructions not to do so, and the victim consequently suffered from anxiety and sleeplessness
            and altered her daily living activities. Thomas v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 773 S.E.2d 900 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            It was not error to issue a domestic violence protection order because a husband's text messages causing his wife's fear of continued harassment, under G.S. 50B-1(a)(2) and G.S. 14-277.3A(b)(2), created "substantial emotional distress." Stancill v. Stancill,
            <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 773 S.E.2d 890 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            It was not error to issue an ex parte domestic violence protection order because an G.S. 50B-1(a)(2) "act of domestic violence" was sufficiently found, as a husband's text messages put his wife in fear of continued harassment inflicting substantial emotional
            distress. Stancill v. Stancill, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 773 S.E.2d 890 (2015).

            Declaratory Relief. - Appellate court erred in reversing a trial court's denial of a husband's request for a declaratory judgment on the constitutionality of G.S. 50B-1 et seq., because G.S. 1-257 permitted a trial court, in the exercise of its discretion,
            to decline a request for declaratory relief when (1) the requested declaration would serve no useful purpose in clarifying or settling the legal relations at issue, or (2) the requested declaration would not terminate or afford relief from
            the uncertainty, insecurity, or controversy giving rise to the proceeding; in the instant case the trial court had dismissed a wife's motion for a domestic violence protective order against the husband, and because the husband was not subject
            to the provisions of the DVA at the time the trial court addressed his counterclaim and because he made no showing that he was threatened with further litigation under the DVA, a declaration as to the constitutionality of the DVA could not
            have altered the husband's legal position. Augur v. Augur, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 582</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 125 (2002).

            Collateral estoppel effect of findings in domestic violence protective order entered under G.S. 50B-1(a), finding that the mother was responsible for the incident, collaterally estopped the finding in the custody case that the father was responsible for
            the incident; when the protective order was not appealed the collateral legal consequences of that order became final, precluding reconsideration of the order in the custody action under G.S. 50-13.2.

            Personal Relationship. - Defendant received a trial free of error because any evidence offered by the State to show that he took advantage of a position of trust or confidence could be used to establish a statutory aggravating factor where the statutory
            definition of a "personal relationship" did not require proof of either a position of trust or confidence or the abuse of that position, the record lacked sufficient evidence to make a determination on defendant's ineffective assistance of
            counsel claim, and defendant's habitual felon status was not void where he was validly convicted of felony violation of a domestic violence protective order. State v. Edgerton, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 774
            S.E.2d 927 (2015).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Domestic violence protective order entered pursuant to G.S. 50B-3 was erroneous because there was no competent evidence that the father against whom the order was entered had placed a member of the mother's family in fear of (1) imminent serious bodily
            injury or (2) continued harassment that rose to such a level as to inflict substantial emotional distress; the fact that there was an investigation by the Department of Social Service was not relevant where there was no evidence presented
            regarding what any alleged investigation revealed. The trial court admitted a statement made to the mother by her son for the limited purpose of explaining why the mother left the home, and, thus, the statement was not admitted to prove that
            the father committed the act at issue, and was not competent to support a finding of domestic violence by the father. Burress v. Burress, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 672 S.E.2d 732 (2009).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            TRO Was Not a "Protective Order." - Trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence under G.S. 50B-4.1(d) for his knowing violation of a valid protective order because a temporary restraining order (TRO) was not a valid domestic violence protective
            order under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50B</a></cite> but an ex parte TRO entered under N.C. R. Civ. P. 65(b), and the order was not entered upon hearing by the trial court
            or consent of the parties as required under G.S. 50B-1(c); only a valid protective order entered under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50B</a></cite> can be used to enhance a defendant's sentence
            under G.S. 50B-4.1(d), and Chapter 50B requires that a defendant be given notice and the opportunity to be heard before entry of a protective order. State v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 214</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 323 (2009).

            Insufficient Evidence of Domestic Violence. - Trial court erred by issuing a domestic violence order of protection, because defendant ex-husband's act of hiring a PI service to conduct surveillance in order to determine if plaintiff ex-wife was cohabiting
            was not harassment and did not support a conclusion that defendant committed an act of domestic violence under G.S. 50-1(a). In addition, the "act" of hiring a PI service for surveillance was not enough to support the trial court's finding
            of "substantial emotional distress" under G.S. 50B-1(a)(2). Kennedy v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 219, 726 S.E.2d 193 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court's findings of fact did not support a finding of domestic violence because trial court's finding that the husband was listening to the wife outside her bedroom door, then after she locked the door, the husband repeatedly pounded on the door
            and broke into the wife's bedroom, causing her fear of physical assault was not supported by competent evidence, as the evidence showed that the husband used a key to unlock the door and did not break into the wife's bedroom. Martin v. Martin,
            - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 191 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
            Wife's testimony regarding the husband's anger issues showed that he had a flashpoint temper but was not sufficient to show an act of domestic violence. Martin v. Martin, - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 191 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
            Sufficient Evidence of Domestic Violence. - Father intentionally caused bodily injury to a minor child with whom he resided when he struck one child and hit the other child in the mouth, causing her to suffer a busted lip, and the trial court properly
            characterized the father's actions as domestic violence. In re A.L.T., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 774 S.E.2d 316 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Sufficient evidence showed a mother who sought a domestic violence protective order suffered substantial emotional distress due to a father's text messages because the mother testified the father's repeated contact caused the mother to feel terror, to
            change the mother's housing arrangements, and to alter the mother's daily routine. Bunting v. Bunting, - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 183 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
            Matter Remanded to Correct Clerical Errors. - Because clerical errors did not affect the sentences imposed, and because failure to correct those errors could prejudice defendant, the matter was remanded to the trial court for the correction of the clerical
            errors; none of the original judgments suspending sentence supported the trial court's findings, and the trial court "inadvertently" checked a box on the preprinted forms. State v. Peele, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite>            159, 783 S.E.2d 28 (2016).

                Any person residing in this State may seek relief under this Chapter by filing a civil action or by filing a motion in any existing action filed under Chapter 50 of the General Statutes alleging acts of domestic violence against himself or herself or
                a minor child who resides with or is in the custody of such person. Any aggrieved party entitled to relief under this Chapter may file a civil action and proceed pro se, without the assistance of legal counsel. The district court division
                of the General Court of Justice shall have original jurisdiction over actions instituted under this Chapter. Any action for a domestic violence protective order requires that a summons be issued and served. The summons issued pursuant
                to this Chapter shall require the defendant to answer within 10 days of the date of service. Attachments to the summons shall include the complaint, notice of hearing, any temporary or ex parte order that has been issued, and other papers

     CASE NOTES

        </h4>
        <p>
            The dismissal of a temporary ex parte domestic violence protective order was interlocutory, did not affect a substantial right, and therefore was not immediately appealable. Hayes v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 831, 534
            S.E.2d 639 (2000).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Time Limits. - Trial court lacked authority to enter a one-year domestic violence protective order (DVPO) that was based upon the same complaint as an ex parte DVPO because, at that time, the ex parte DVPO expired without being renewed and had been in
            effect for more than a year. Rudder v. Rudder, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 173, 759 S.E.2d 321 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Renewal of Order. - Inclusion of a residency requirement in the statutory provision governing the initial issuance of a domestic violence protective order (DVPO) coupled with the omission of such a requirement in the statute authorizing the renewal of
            a DVPO demonstrates a legislative intent to permit such a renewal regardless of whether the moving party remains a North Carolina resident. Comstock v. Comstock, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 780 S.E.2d 183 (2015).

     Judicial Immunity Granted.
    </b> - Whether or not a magistrate's alleged comments made in connection with plaintiff's arrest regarding a domestic violence matter were appropriate, they were made in connection with judicial acts within the magistrate's jurisdiction;
            he was, therefore, entitled to immunity, and his motion to dismiss plaintiff's 42 U.S.C.S.
            <span class="s1">
     §
    </span> 1983 claim was granted. Cole v. Summey, 329 F. Supp. 2d 591 (M.D.N.C. 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Allegations Sufficient to Withstand Motion to Dismiss.
    </b> - Pro se complaint was improperly dismissed for failure to state a claim where plaintiff alleged that defendant was verbally abusive to her and her children, that her daughter had reported allegations of sexual abuse committed by
            defendant to her school counselor, and the additional alleged acts of abuse were sufficiently detailed so as to give the court and defendant a fair idea of what plaintiff was complaining. Quackenbush v. Groat, - N.C. App. - , 844 S.E.2d 26
            (2020).
        </p>
        <p>
            Father's text messages to a mother supported a domestic violence protective order because, as the father had no custody of the parties' children, the father's messages allegedly concerning the children served no legitimate purpose. Bunting v. Bunting,
            - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 183 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
            Due Process Violation. - It was not error to issue an ex parte domestic violence protection order because an G.S. 50B-1(a)(2) "act of domestic violence" was sufficiently found, as a husband's text messages put his wife in fear of continued harassment
            inflicting substantial emotional distress. Stancill v. Stancill, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 773 S.E.2d 890 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court did not exceed the court's jurisdiction in entering ex parte domestic violence protective orders and the proceedings comported with the statute because the father had at least five days in which to submit a formal, written answer, had an opportunity
            to respond to the mother's allegations, was permitted to appear and testify even though he had not filed an answer, and his admissions and the mother's testimony constituted competent evidence to justify the trial court's findings of fact.
            Henderson v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 758 S.E.2d 681 (2014).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court properly entered an ex parte domestic violence protection order because the combination of two of its findings were minimally adequate to supply the required "specific facts" necessary to support the conclusion that defendant committed acts
            of domestic violence against plaintiff and that there was a danger of acts of domestic violence against plaintiff. Rudder v. Rudder, - N.C. App. - , 754 S.E.2d 678 (2014), amended 759 S.E.2d 321, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite>            LEXIS 562 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Insufficient Evidence to Support Domestic Violence Order of Protection. - Trial court erred by issuing a domestic violence order of protection, because defendant ex-husband's act of hiring a PI service to conduct surveillance in order to determine if
            plaintiff ex-wife was cohabiting was not harassment and did not support a conclusion that defendant committed an act of domestic violence under G.S. 50B-2(a). Kennedy v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 219, 726
            S.E.2d 193 (2012).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Presumed Facts Found in Ex Parte Domestic Violence Order of Protection Supported by Competent Evidence. - Court of appeals could presume that the facts as found in an ex parte domestic violence order of protection (DVPO) were supported by competent evidence
            because the record reflected that an ex parte hearing was held, and the wife appeared pro se before the trial court to request the ex parte DVPO, so presumably she offered evidence; although the record did not contain any transcript of the
            ex parte hearing, the ex parte DVPO provided that the matter was heard by the trial judge, and given the expedited nature of the ex parte hearing process, it was a possibility that no transcript of that hearing was available to the parties.
            Hensey v. Hennessy, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 685 S.E.2d 541 (2009).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Sufficient Evidence Supported Ex Parte Domestic Violence Order of Protection. - Trial court did not err in its conclusion that a wife was in danger of acts of domestic violence and in need of protection because the findings of fact showed that on the
            Saturday prior to the Monday on which the wife filed her complaint, her husband had broken and hidden her cell phone and heckled her, the husband then put the wife in a headlock, dragged her, and banged her into a wall, and when the wife got
            away from the husband, he chased her until she reached a neighbor's home to call for help; in addition, the wife was 29 weeks pregnant with the husband's child; the wife and husband had other pending domestic violence proceedings, and the
            wife believed that she was in serious, immediate danger.. Hensey v. Hennessy, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 685 S.E.2d 541 (2009).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Findings of Fact Appropriate. - Ex parte domestic violence order of protection (DVPO) did not fail to include findings of fact when the trial court simply incorporated the allegations of the complaint into its order, rather than setting forth a separate
            statement of its factual findings, because while it was preferable for the trial court to set forth the specific facts that supported its order separately, instead of by reference to the complaint, the ex parte DVPO, read in conjunction with
            the complaint, provided sufficient information upon which the court of appeals could review the trial court's decision to issue the ex parte DVPO; despite the absence of specific statutory language excluding ex parte DVPOs from the coverage
            of the findings and conclusions requirement of G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 52, such orders need not contain findings and conclusions that fully satisfy the requirements of that provision. Hensey v. Hennessy, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite>            56, 685 S.E.2d 541 (2009).

     CASE NOTES
    </b>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Due Process. - Trial court erred in dismissing a former girlfriend's complaint and motion for a domestic violence protective order (DVPO) as a "Dueling 50B" because her statutory and due process rights to a hearing were violated where, while both her
            and her former boyfriend's motions were set for hearing on the same date, only the former boyfriend's motion was heard, the trial judge was required to ensure that the right of each party to due process was preserved before entering mutual
            orders, the order did not provide a sufficient basis for dismissal, and having dueling DVPO motions did not require denial of both motions. Holder v. Kunath, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 605, 781 S.E.2d 806 (2016).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>
     Personal Jurisdiction Over Defendant Lacking.
    </b> - District court could not exercise personal jurisdiction over defendant in plaintiff's action seeking domestic violence protection order because only contact defendant had with North Carolina were calls he made to plaintiff's cell
            phone on day she moved to the state; defendant did not purposefully avail himself of the benefits and protections of the state's laws and nothing supported the inference that defendant knew or had any reason to know that plaintiff was present
            in the state. Mucha v. Wagner, - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 13, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
            Status exception to personal jurisdiction was not extended to this case where plaintiff sought domestic violence protection order; while North Carolina court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendant, who did not know plaintiff was in North Carolina
            when he called her, she could seek domestic violence protection orders in any court with personal jurisdiction over defendant, including his home state. Mucha v. Wagner, - N.C. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 13, 2021).
        </p>
        <p>
            Plaintiff's Fear of Defendant. - In a case in which defendant appealed an order of the trial court renewing plaintiff's domestic violence protective order pursuant to G.S. 50B-3(b), plaintiff's testimony was adequate to support a finding that she was
            in subjective fear of defendant. Forehand v. Forehand, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 767 S.E.2d 125 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Domestic Violence Protective Order Properly Issued. - Term "over time", construed broadly, categorically does not preclude a short-term romantic relationship, from ever being considered a "dating relationship"; instead, the question of what constitutes
            the minimum conduct to establish a dating relationship is necessarily fact sensitive and thus warrants a factor approach rather than a definitional approach. Therefore, a trial court properly entered a domestic violence protective order against
            a former boyfriend because it determined that the parties had a dating relationship, even though it only lasted for 3 weeks, because the parties' relationship exceeded the minimal social interpersonal bonding of casual acquaintances or of
            contacts through ordinary fraternization. Thomas v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 236, 773 S.E.2d 900 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Father's text messages to a mother supported a domestic violence protective order because, as the father had no custody of the parties' children, the father's messages allegedly concerning the children served no legitimate purpose. Bunting v. Bunting,
            - N.C. App. - , 832 S.E.2d 183 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
            Domestic Violence Protective Order Improperly Issued. - The court's findings of fact did not support its conclusion of law that an act of domestic violence had occurred, where the court found that the husband had threatened the wife with immediate serious
            bodily injury, but no acts of domestic violence had been shown of which the court could bring about a cessation. Brandon v. Brandon, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 646, 513 S.E.2d 589 (1999).
        </p>
        <p>
            Domestic violence protective order was not appropriate when daughter said that her father's touching made her feel creepy, but failed to demonstrate that she was in fear of bodily injury. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. App.</cite>            434, 549 S.E.2d 912 (2001).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred in entering a domestic violence order of protection (DVPO) because there was no competent evidence to support the trial court's findings of fact when a wife presented absolutely no evidence before the trial court at the DVPO hearing;
            because the trial judge presided over the criminal case in which charges stemming from the incident were brought against the husband, the trial judge concluded that he did not have not hear any evidence regarding the civil matter, but judicial
            notice was entirely inappropriate for factual issues. Hensey v. Hennessy, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 685 S.E.2d 541 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred by issuing a domestic violence order of protection, because defendant ex-husband's act of hiring a PI service to conduct surveillance in order to determine if plaintiff ex-wife was cohabiting was not harassment and did not support a
            conclusion that defendant committed an act of domestic violence under G.S. 50B-3(a). Kennedy v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 219, 726 S.E.2d 193 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
            As a trial court's entry of a domestic violence protective order under G.S. 50B-3(b) was error, in that it was based on inadmissible evidence and improperly judicially noticed adjudicative facts, the order was to be either vacated, or if it had been renewed,
            then a new trial was warranted. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 739 S.E.2d 876 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court lacked authority to enter a one-year domestic violence protective order (DVPO) that was based upon the same complaint as an ex parte DVPO because, at that time, the ex parte DVPO expired without being renewed and had been in effect for more
            than a year. Rudder v. Rudder, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 173, 759 S.E.2d 321 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Domestic violence protective order entered pursuant to G.S. 50B-3 was erroneous because there was no competent evidence that the father against whom the order was entered had placed a member of the mother's family in fear of (1) imminent serious bodily
            injury or (2) continued harassment that rose to such a level as to inflict substantial emotional distress; the fact that there was an investigation by the Department of Social Service was not relevant where there was no evidence presented
            regarding what any alleged investigation revealed. The trial court admitted a statement made to the mother by her son for the limited purpose of explaining why the mother left the home, and, thus, the statement was not admitted to prove that
            the father committed the act at issue, and was not competent to support a finding of domestic violence by the father. Burress v. Burress, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 672 S.E.2d 732 (2009).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Expired Protective Order Not Subject to Renewal. - Because the statute requires a party to file a motion for renewal prior to the expiration of the current order, it follows that once a protective order expires, it is no longer subject to renewal under
            the statute. Rudder v. Rudder, - N.C. App. - , 754 S.E.2d 678 (2014), amended 759 S.E.2d 321, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 562 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014).

            Renewal of Order. - There was nothing in G.S. 50B-3 nor in the caselaw prohibiting the trial court from basing its decision whether to renew domestic violence protective order (DVPO) on acts that happened in the past which served as the basis for issuance
            of the original DVPO. Forehand v. Forehand, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 767 S.E.2d 125 (2014).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court possessed the authority pursuant to G.S. 50B-3(b) to renew a domestic violence protective order against defendant, even though plaintiff, when she filed her motion seeking its renewal, no longer resided in North Carolina. Comstock v. Comstock,
            <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 780 S.E.2d 183 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Inclusion of a residency requirement in the statutory provision governing the initial issuance of a domestic violence protective order (DVPO) coupled with the omission of such a requirement in the statute authorizing the renewal of a DVPO demonstrates
            a legislative intent to permit such a renewal regardless of whether the moving party remains a North Carolina resident. Comstock v. Comstock, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 780 S.E.2d 183 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            No findings supported a trial court's conclusion of law that "good cause" existed to renew a domestic violence protective order; the findings of fact that did support a finding of "good cause" were contained in the order entered after the trial court
            was divested of jurisdiction. The supplemental order, which was entered after a notice of appeal, was void for lack of jurisdiction. Ponder v. Ponder, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 786 S.E.2d 44 (2016), appeal
            dismissed and review denied, 797 S.E.2d 290, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 218 (2017).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Mootness. - Father's appeal of domestic violence protective order was not moot even though the order had expired as the father still might face legal consequences from the order. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. App.</cite> 434,
            549 S.E.2d 912 (2001).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Consent Decree Vacated. - Trial court's authority to enter a protective order or approve a consent agreement is dependent upon finding that an act of domestic violence occurred and that the order furthers the purpose of ceasing acts of domestic violence;
            since a trial court's order approving a consent agreement provided that the domestic violence claims were dismissed, the trial court did not have authority to enter the consent decree, and the consent decree was vacated. Bryant v. Williams,
            <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 444, 588 S.E.2d 506 (2003).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Collateral Estoppel Effect of Findings in Protective Order. - Where a trial judge found in domestic violence protective order proceedings that the mother was responsible for the altercation and where a different trial judge made the opposite finding in
            later custody proceedings, G.S. 50B-3(a1)(4) did not preclude an award of primary physical custody to the mother, but G.S. 50B-3(a1)(4) did not mandate a de novo consideration of which party committed domestic violence, as this would have
            undermined the mandate of G.S. 50B-3(a) requiring a trial court to issue a domestic violence protective order if it found that domestic violence occurred. Doyle v. Doyle, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 626 S.E.2d
            845 (2006).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Evidence Inadmissible to Support Order. - Trial court's entry of a domestic violence protective order under G.S. 50B-3(b) in favor of a wife was error where the trial court relied on inadmissible hearsay testimony from her under G.S. 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid.
            801(c) and 802 that she had a diagnosis of a cervical strain; there was no showing that such testimony was within any of the exceptions under G.S. 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 803. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite>            499, 739 S.E.2d 876 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court's entry of a domestic violence protective order under G.S. 50B-3(b) in favor of a wife could not stand where the trial court committed prejudicial error when it took judicial notice of a criminal file, as there was no final judgment in the
            criminal proceeding. Little v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 739 S.E.2d 876 (2013).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Insufficient Evidence That Order Was Violated. - Defendant was entitled to dismissal of the charge of violation for violating a protective order, because the evidence only raised a suspicion of guilt and was inadequate for a reasonable mind to support
            the conclusion that defendant went to a shopping area knowing that the individual the order was protecting worked there and thus, that defendant failed to "stay away" from her; there was no evidence defendant knew that the subject of the protective
            order worked at the location at issue. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 741 S.E.2d 9 (2013).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the civil domestic violence protective at issue only required defendant to surrender any weapons that he might have, the officers executing the order lacked probable cause to suspect
            any particular criminal activity when they approached defendant's home, there were no exigent circumstances, and the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence obtained in violation of the State constitution. State
            v. Elder, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 753 S.E.2d 504, review denied, 758 S.E.2d 863, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 417 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Attorney Fees. - In a case involving a domestic violence protective order (DVPO), a trial court was without jurisdiction to enter an award of attorney's fees because it was a matter affected by the judgment appealed from. The award was based, in part,
            on the motion to renew the DVPO, which resulted in a void ab initio DVPO renewal order. Ponder v. Ponder, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 786 S.E.2d 44 (2016), appeal dismissed and review denied, 797 S.E.2d 290,

            Validity of Order. - The ex parte domestic violence order was a valid protective order for purposes of this section and G.S. 14-269.8. State v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 745 S.E.2d 26 (2013), dismissed and review
            denied 749 S.E.2d 885, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1282.
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court exceeded its authority under G.S. 50C-7 because it had no authority to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit; even if the order had been entered under N.C.
            Gen. Stat. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50B</a></cite>, the order requiring surrender of firearms would have been in error because there was no evidence to support the required
            findings of fact under G.S. 50B-3.1. Russell v. Wofford, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 816 S.E.2d 909 (2018).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the civil domestic violence protective at issue only required defendant to surrender any weapons that he might have, the officers executing the order lacked probable cause to suspect
            any particular criminal activity when they approached defendant's home, there were no exigent circumstances, and the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence obtained in violation of the State constitution. State
            v. Elder, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 753 S.E.2d 504, review denied, 758 S.E.2d 863, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 417 (2014).
            <br />

        <p>
            Renewal Of Expired Protective Order. - Inquiry under the statute is whether the protective order has been renewed, not whether the protective order should be renewed; this suggests that once a protective order expires, an aggrieved party may not proceed
            on a request to renew the expired protective order, nevertheless, nothing prevents the party from filing a new complaint and reinitiating the process. Rudder v. Rudder, - N.C. App. - , 754 S.E.2d 678 (2014), amended 759 S.E.2d 321,
            <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 562 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014).

        </p>
        <p>
            Trial Court Had No Authority To Enter One-Year Domestic Violence Protection Order After Ex Parte Domestic Violence Protective Order Expired. - Trial court did not have authority to enter a one-year domestic violence protection order (DVPO) because its
            ex parte DVPO expired without being renewed; because the ex parte DVPO expired by its own terms, it could not be renewed, and the only issue properly before the trial court was whether defendant was entitled to the return of his firearms under
            subsection (f). Rudder v. Rudder, - N.C. App. - , 754 S.E.2d 678 (2014), amended 759 S.E.2d 321, <cite class="nc_code">2014 N.C. App.</cite> LEXIS 562 (N.C. Ct. App. 2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Return. - Weapons surrendered under a domestic violence protective order should have been returned because convictions for stalking and communicating threats did not constitute "misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence," and federal law did not preclude
            the gun owner from having or possessing a firearm, even if the owner and a victim were in a "personal relationship." Underwood v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 535, 781 S.E.2d 295 (2015).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Surrender of Firearms Properly Ordered. - It was not error to order a husband to surrender firearms as part of an ex parte domestic violence protection order because the husband's alleged suicide threat, alcoholism, and volatile behavior sufficiently
            demonstrated an G.S. 50B-3.1(a) "threat to commit suicide." Stancill v. Stancill, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 773 S.E.2d 890 (2015).

        <p>
            Failure to Make Required Findings. - It was error to order a husband, in a domestic violence protection order, to surrender firearms because the court did not make the findings required by G.S. 50B-3.1(a). Stancill v. Stancill, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite>            529, 773 S.E.2d 890 (2015).

            Civil Liability for Failing to Enforce Protective Order. - If, as plaintiff alleged, police officers promised to protect her by arresting her husband for violating a protective order but failed to do so, and her reliance on the promise was causally related
            to her injury by her husband, the officers owed her a "special duty" and therefore were not shielded from liability for negligence under the public duty doctrine. Cockerham-Ellerbee v.

            in possession of a deadly weapon on or about his or her person or within close proximity to his or her person. State v. Edgerton, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 759 S.E.2d 669 (2014), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 32</cite>,

            Civil Liability for Failing to Enforce Protective Order. - If, as plaintiff alleged, police officers promised to protect her by arresting her husband for violating a protective order but failed to do so, and her reliance on the promise was causally related
            to her injury by her husband, the officers owed her a "special duty" and therefore were not shielded from liability for negligence under the public duty doctrine. Cockerham-Ellerbee v. Town of Jonesville, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite>            372, 626 S.E.2d 685 (2006). See Editor's note under G.S. 50B-4.1, quoting Session Laws 2009-389, s. 1, as to the holding in this case.

            Enhancement for Knowingly Violating Protective Order. - In reversing the Code of Appeals' decision in State v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 597, 649 S.E.2d 444 (2007), the North Carolina Supreme Code ruled that the defendant
            was subject to an enhanced penalty for knowingly violating a temporary restraining order (TRO) because the TRO was a protective order entered pursuant to a hearing; the "hearing" requirement in G.S. 50B-1(c) was satisfied when defendant received
            notice that a TRO had entered against defendant. State v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 214</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 323 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred in enhancing defendant's sentence under G.S. 50B-4.1(d) for his knowing violation of a valid protective order because a temporary restraining order (TRO) was not a valid domestic violence protective order under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50B</a></cite>            but an ex parte TRO entered under N.C. R. Civ. P. 65(b), and the order was not entered upon hearing by the trial court or consent of the parties as required under G.S. 50B-1(c); only a valid protective order entered under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50B</a></cite>            can be used to enhance a defendant's sentence under G.S. 50B-4.1(d), and Chapter 50B requires that a defendant be given notice and the opportunity to be heard before entry of a protective order. State v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 214</cite>,
            675 S.E.2d 323 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
            By limiting applicability of the enhancement provision to violation of protective orders issued after a hearing, the General Assembly recognizes and gives deference to protection of a defendant's liberty interest through due process of law; therefore,
            a temporary restraining order entered under N.C. R. Civ. P. 65(b) is not the functional legal equivalent of a protective order entered pursuant to the procedure set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50B</a></cite>.
            State v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 214</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 323 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court erred in submitting to the jury the element of knowing violation of a domestic violence protective order (DVPO) to enhance defendant's punishments for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury and attempted
            second-degree kidnapping because the DVPO statute did not apply to a person "charged with" or "convicted of" certain felonies and defendant was "a person charged." State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 425,
            768 S.E.2d 883 (2015).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Jury Instructions. - Trial court's failure to instruct on the misdemeanor crime of violating a domestic violence protective order (DVPO) rose to the level of plain error because the lack of a misdemeanor sentencing option likely impacted the jury's finding
            of guilt on the felony charge; with the elements of the misdemeanor DVPO violation likely met, the jury's only method to sentence the defendant for violating the DVPO was through the felony violation of a DVPO with a deadly weapon. State v.
            Edgerton, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 759 S.E.2d 669 (2014), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 32</cite>, 769 S.E.2d 837, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 262 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            As the misdemeanor violation of a domestic violence protective order (DVPO) is a lesser included offense of the felony violation of a DVPO, a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on that charge if the evidence would permit a jury rationally to
            find him or her guilty of the lesser offense and acquit him or her of the greater. State v. Edgerton, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 759 S.E.2d 669 (2014), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 32</cite>, 769 S.E.2d
            837, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 262 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the trial court concluded that a knife was not a deadly weapon per se, the court should have instructed the jury on the lesser-included misdemeanor offense of violating a domestic violence protective order (DVPO); based on conflicting evidence
            of the knife's deadly qualities, a jury could have rationally found the defendant guilty of the lesser-included offense of misdemeanor violation of a DVPO. State v. Edgerton, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 759
            S.E.2d 669 (2014), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 32</cite>, 769 S.E.2d 837, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 262 (2015).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Habitual Offender Conviction Vacated. - Defendant's convictions for habitual violation of a domestic violence protection order were vacated because defendant was convicted of interfering with a witness based on the same conduct, and G.S. 50B-4.1(f) barred
            the convictions if another law required greater punishment. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 767 S.E.2d 341 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Habitual Offender Conviction Affirmed. - Trial court properly denied defendant's motions to dismiss a charge arising under G.S. 50B-4.1(g1) where he did not dispute that he was subject to a domestic violence protective order previously obtained by the
            victim. The victim resided at a safe house on a specific date, and he parked his car in the safe house's parking lot and then walked up to the front door of the shelter on that date. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite>            239, 784 S.E.2d 232 (2016), review denied, 792 S.E.2d 503, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 679 (2016).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Establishment of Statutory Aggravating Factor. - Defendant received a trial free of error because any evidence offered by the State to show that he took advantage of a position of trust or confidence could be used to establish a statutory aggravating
            factor where the statutory definition of a "personal relationship" did not require proof of either a position of trust or confidence or the abuse of that position, the record lacked sufficient evidence to make a determination on defendant's
            ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and defendant's habitual felon status was not void where he was validly convicted of felony violation of a domestic violence protective order. State v. Edgerton, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite>            460, 774 S.E.2d 927 (2015).

            <b>
     Insufficient Evidence.
    </b> - Defendant's motions to dismiss the charge of violation of a protective order while in possession of a deadly weapon was improperly denied as the State failed to present sufficient evidence of defendant's knowledge of the second
            domestic violence protective order (DVPO) because, although he was aware of the terms of the first DVPO, including the requirement to stay away from the victim, there was no direct evidence that he had knowledge, constructively or in fact,
            of the second DVPO, and any circumstantial evidence of his knowledge was tenuous at best. State v. Tucker, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Aug. 18, 2020).
