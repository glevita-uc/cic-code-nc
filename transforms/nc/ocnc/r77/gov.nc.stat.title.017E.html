     § 17E-1. Findings and policy.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    The General Assembly finds and declares that the office of sheriff, the office of deputy sheriff and the other officers and employees of the sheriff of a county are unique among all of the law-enforcement offices of North Carolina. The administration of criminal justice has been declared by Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 17C</a></cite> of the General Statutes to be of statewide concern to the people of the State. The sheriff is the only officer of local government required by the Constitution. The sheriff, in addition to his criminal justice responsibilities, is the only officer who is also responsible for the courts of the State, and acting as their bailiff and marshall. The sheriff administers and executes criminal and civil justice and acts as the ex officio detention officer.
   </p>
   <p>
    The deputy sheriff has been held by the Supreme Court of this State to hold an office of special trust and confidence, acting in the name of and with powers coterminous with his principal, the elected sheriff.
   </p>
   <p>
    The offices of sheriff and deputy sheriff are therefore of special concern to the public health, safety, welfare and morals of the people of the State. The training and educational needs of such officers therefore require particularized and differential treatment from those of the criminal justice officers certified under Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 17C</a></cite> of the General Statutes.

     CASE NOTES
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p>
    Sheriff's Department is Local Governmental Entity.
   
   - In the injured party's suit against a sheriff and individual detention officers arising out of a five-day episode in the county detention center where she alleged that they ignored her requests for medical treatment, the trial court properly concluded that the office of North Carolina sheriff was a "person" under 42 U.S.C.S.
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1983 because: (1) the state constitution created the office of sheriff, N.C. Const. art. VII,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   2, but included that provision within the article governing local governments, along with provisions for counties, cities, towns, and other governmental subdivisions, N.C. Const. art. VII,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1; (2) state statutes, including <cite class="octn"><a href="#t17Es17E-1" target="_self">G.S. 17E-1</a></cite>, 160A-288.2, 143-166.50, and 97-2, characterized a sheriff's department as a local governmental entity; (3) there was no contention that the State would be potentially liable for any monetary judgment entered against the sheriff and the detention officers; and (4) the State did not have, with respect to a sheriff, the minimum degree of control required for Eleventh Amendment immunity. Boyd v. Robeson County, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 621 S.E.2d 1 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 629</cite>, 615 S.E.2d 866 (2005).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Deputy Sheriffs.
   
   - In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is not a county employee. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Termination for Political Reasons.
    </b>
    - In North Carolina, deputy sheriffs may be lawfully terminated for political reasons; the office of deputy sheriff is that of policy maker, and the deputy sheriff is an alter ego of the sheriff generally. Jenkins v. Medford, 119 F.3d 1156 (4th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1090, 118 S. Ct. 881, 139 L. Ed. 2d 869 (1998).
   </p>
   <p>
    Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be lawfully terminated for political reasons under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary to ensure that the sheriff's policies are carried out. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).

     Justice officers, other than those set forth in subsection (c1) of this section, shall not be required to meet any requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section as a condition of continued employment, nor shall failure of a justice officer to fulfill such requirements make him ineligible for any promotional examination for which he is otherwise eligible if the officer held an appointment prior to July 1, 1983, and is a sworn law-enforcement officer with power of arrest. The legislature finds, and it is hereby declared to be the policy of this Chapter, that such officers have satisfied such requirements by their experience. It is the intent of the Chapter that all justice officers employed at the entry level after the Commission has adopted the required standards shall meet the requirements of this Chapter. All justice officers who are exempted from the required entry level standards by this subsection are subject to the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section as well as the requirements of G.S. 17E-4(a) in order to retain certification.

     The Commission shall provide, by regulation, that no person may be appointed as a justice officer at entry level, except on a temporary or probationary basis, unless such person has satisfactorily completed an initial preparatory program of training at a school certified by the Commission or has been exempted from that requirement by the Commission pursuant to this Chapter. Upon separation of a justice officer from a sheriff's department within the temporary or probationary period of appointment, the probationary certification shall be terminated by the Commission. Upon the reappointment to the same department or appointment to another department of an officer who has separated from a department within the probationary period, the officer shall be charged with the amount of time served during his initial appointment and allowed the remainder of the probationary period to complete the basic training requirement. Upon the reappointment to the same department or appointment to another department of an officer who has separated from a department within the probationary period and who has remained out of service for more than one year from the date of separation, the officer shall be allowed another probationary period to complete such training as the Commission shall require by rule for an officer returning to service.

     In addition to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, the Commission, by rules and regulations, may fix other qualifications for the employment and retention of justice officers including minimum age, education, physical and mental standards, citizenship, good moral character, experience, and such other matters as relate to the competence and reliability of persons to assume and discharge the responsibilities of the office, and the Commission shall prescribe the means for presenting evidence of fulfillment of these requirements.

Any person employed in the capacity of a telecommunicator as defined by the Commission on or before March 1, 1998, shall not be required to meet any entry-level requirements as a condition of continued employment but shall be reported to the Commission for certification. All justice officers who are exempted from the required entry-level standards by this subsection are subject to the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section as well as the requirements of G.S. 17E-4(a) in order to retain certification.

     Any justice officer who the Commission determines does not comply with this Chapter or any rules adopted under this Chapter shall not exercise the powers of a justice officer and shall not exercise the power of arrest unless the Commission waives that certification or deficiency. The Commission shall enforce this section by the entry of appropriate orders effective upon service on either the department or the justice officer.

     The Commission may appear in its own name and apply to courts having jurisdiction for injunctions to prevent violations of this Chapter or of rules issued pursuant thereto; specifically, the performance of justice officer functions by officers or individuals who are not in compliance with the standards and requirements of this Chapter or of rules issued pursuant thereto. A single act of performance of a justice officer function by an officer or individual who is performing such function in violation of this Chapter is sufficient, if shown, to invoke the injunctive relief of this section.
