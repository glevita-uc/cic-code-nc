            Legislative Intent. - The Chapter, when read as a whole, makes it clear that the legislature's intent in the "representation," "conveying" and "holding out" provisions of the Chapter was to protect the public from misrepresentations of professional status
            or expertise. North Carolina State Bd. of Registration v. IBM Corp., <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 230 S.E.2d 552 (1976).

            penalties, must be read subject to the basic prohibitory section of the Chapter, this section, which makes it unlawful "to use in connection with his name or otherwise or advertise any title or description tending to convey the impression
            that he is . . . a professional engineer . . . unless such person has been duly registered as such." North Carolina State Bd. of Registration v. IBM Corp., <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 230 S.E.2d 552 (1976).

            This section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t89Cs89C-23" target="_self">G.S. 89C-23</a></cite> authorize the Board to prohibit only those uses of the title engineer which imply or represent professional engineering status or expertise. North

            The mere use of the term "Customer Engineer" on business cards and in a newspaper article does not constitute the offering to practice engineering or the representation of professional engineering status or expertise in violation of this section. North

            Trial court erred by relying on <cite class="octn"><a href="#t89Cs89C-2" target="_self">G.S. 89C-2</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t89Cs89C-3" target="_self">G.S. 89C-3</a></cite> to determine the standard of care that a surveying
            company owed to a general contractor when it marked the location of columns that were installed to support a building; but because the evidence introduced by the contractor supported its claim that the surveying company was negligent, the
            error was harmless. Associated Indus. Contrs., Inc. v. Fleming Eng'g, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 590 S.E.2d 866 (2004), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 296</cite>, 608 S.E.2d 757 (2005).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            No Specific Standard of Care Created. - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in ruling that the method of proof administrators' witness used was not sufficiently reliable as an area for expert testimony because the witness based his opinion
            solely on a methodology that was previously found to be insufficient to establish the standard of care applicable to professional engineers; <cite class="octn"><a href="#t89Cs89C-2" target="_self">G.S. 89C-2</a></cite> and 89C-3
            were analogous to the code of ethics for engineers upon which the witness solely relied to base his expert opinion, but they did not create a specific standard of care for professional engineers. Michael v. Huffman Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite>            256, 661 S.E.2d 1 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 129</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 360 (2009).

            Board has the Authority to Discipline Licensees Violating the Rule of Professional Conduct. - Decision of the North Carolina Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors to suspend a surveyor's license and to reprimand his surveying company was neither

        <p>
            Use of Word "Engineer" Does Not Represent Professional Engineering Status. - It is clear from the definition in subdivision (8) that the use of the word "engineer" without being modified by "professional," "registered" or "licensed," or some word of like
            import does not represent that one is "duly registered and licensed by the Board" and therefore cannot represent that one is a professional engineer as that term is defined in subdivision (8). Since such usage does not represent professional
            engineering status, it cannot constitute the practice of engineering as that term is defined in paragraph (6)a. North Carolina State Bd. of Registration v. IBM Corp., <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 230 S.E.2d 552

            company owed to a general contractor when it marked the location of columns that were installed to support a building; but because the evidence introduced by the contractor supported its claim that the surveying company was negligent, the
            error was harmless. Associated Indus. Contrs., Inc. v. Fleming Eng'g, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 590 S.E.2d 866 (2004), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 296</cite>, 608 S.E.2d 757 (2005).

        <p>
            No Specific Standard of Care Created. - Trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in ruling that the method of proof administrators' witness used was not sufficiently reliable as an area for expert testimony because the witness based his opinion

            <cite class="octn"><a href="#t89Cs89C-3" target="_self">G.S. 89C-3</a></cite> were analogous to the code of ethics for engineers upon which the witness solely relied to base his expert opinion, but they did not create a specific standard of

            A State Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors, whose duty it is to administer the provisions of this Chapter, is created. The Board shall consist of four licensed professional engineers, three licensed professional land surveyors and two public
            members, who are neither professional engineers nor professional land surveyors. Of the land surveyor members, one and only one may hold dual licenses as a professional land surveyor and professional engineer. All of the members shall be appointed
            by the Governor. Appointments of the engineer and land surveyor members shall preferably, but not necessarily, be made from a list of nominees submitted by the professional societies for engineers and land surveyors in this State. Each member
            of the Board shall receive a certificate of appointment from the Governor and shall file with the Secretary of State a written oath or affirmation for the faithful discharge of the duties.
        </p>
        <p>
            Members of the Board serve for staggered five-year terms, and no member may be appointed for more than two full terms. Members serve until the expiration of their respective terms and until their respective successors are appointed. If a vacancy occurs
            during a term, the Governor shall appoint a successor from the same classification as the person causing the vacancy to serve for the remainder of the unexpired term. If the vacancy is not filled within 90 days after it occurs, the Board may
            appoint a provisional member to serve until the appointment by the Governor becomes effective. The provisional member during his tenure has all the powers and duties of a regular member.

            the surveyor did not perform his services in an ethical manner and was not truthful in all of his interactions with a property owner, thus falling short of the professional standards promulgated by the Board, 21 N.C. Admin. Code 56.0701(d)(1)

            Certificates for licensure of corporations and business firms that engage in the practice of engineering or land surveying shall expire on the last day of the month of June following their issuance or renewal and shall become invalid on that date unless
            renewed. All other certificates for licensure shall expire on the last day of the month of December next following their issuance or renewal, and shall become invalid on that date unless renewed. When necessary to protect the public health,
            safety, or welfare, the Board shall require any evidence necessary to establish the continuing competency of engineers and land surveyors as a condition of renewal of licenses. When the Board is satisfied as to the continuing competency of
            an applicant, it shall issue a renewal of the certificate upon payment by the applicant of a fee fixed by the Board but not to exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00). The secretary of the Board shall notify by mail every person licensed under
            this Chapter of the date of expiration of the certificate, the amount of the fee required for its renewal for one year, and any requirement as to evidence of continued competency. The notice shall be mailed at least one month in advance of
            the expiration date of the certificate. Renewal shall be effected at any time during the month immediately following the month of expiration, by payment to the secretary of the Board of a renewal fee, as determined by the Board, which shall
            not exceed seventy-five dollars ($75.00). Failure on the part of any licensee to renew the certificate annually in the month immediately following the month of expiration, as required above, shall deprive the licensee of the right to practice
            until reinstatement of the license. The license may be reinstated at anytime during the first 12 months immediately following the date the license became invalid by payment of a reinstatement fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in addition
            to the established renewal fee. Failure of a licensee to reinstate the license during the first 12 months immediately following the date the license became invalid shall require the individual, prior to resuming practice in North Carolina,
            to submit an application on the prescribed form, and to meet all other requirements for licensure as set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.089C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 89C</a></cite>. The secretary of
            the Board is instructed to remove from the official roster of engineers and land surveyors the names of all licensees who have not effected their renewal by the first day of the month immediately following the renewal period. The Board may
            adopt rules to provide for renewals in distress or hardship cases due to military service, prolonged illness, or prolonged absence from the State, where the applicant for renewal demonstrates to the Board that the applicant has maintained
            active knowledge and professional status as an engineer or land surveyor, as the case may be. It shall be the responsibility of each licensee to inform the Board promptly concerning change in address. A licensee may request and be granted
            inactive status. No inactive licensee may practice in this State unless otherwise exempted in this Chapter. A licensee granted inactive status shall pay annual renewal fees but shall not be subject to annual continuing professional competency
            requirements. A licensee granted inactive status may return to active status by meeting all requirements of the Board, including demonstration of continuing professional competency as a condition of reinstatement.

            Multiple Sanctions. - Under former version of this section, providing that the Board "may suspend, refuse to renew, or revoke the certificate of registration, require reexamination, or levy a fine not in excess of five hundred dollars," the Board was
            authorized to suspend, etc., an engineer's certificate of registration, or to fine him up to $500, but was not authorized to do both. In re Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 387 S.E.2d 82 (1990).

            additionally, petitioner did not have an opportunity at hearing to show compliance with the requirements for retaining his license since he was unaware that the proceeding could result in the suspension, the Board's suspension of petitioner's

            Board has the Authority to Discipline Licensees Violating the Rule of Professional Conduct. - Decision of the North Carolina Board of Examiners for Engineers and Surveyors to suspend a surveyor's license and to reprimand his surveying company was neither
            in excess of its statutory authority nor in violation of the law because the Board found that the surveyor did not perform his services in an ethical manner and was not truthful in all of his interactions with a property owner, thus falling
            short of the professional standards promulgated by the Board., 21 N.C. Admin. Code 56.0701(d)(1) and (g). In re Suttles Surveying, P.A., <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 742 S.E.2d 574, dismissed and review granted,

            Board Precluded from Suspending License. - The Notice of Action Without Hearing sent to petitioner by the board informing petitioner that the board's intended action was a reprimand and fine was misleading, lulling him into believing that his conduct
            would, at most, result in a reprimand or fine - not suspension of his license - and the board was precluded from imposing the greater sanction of license suspension. Miller v. North Carolina State Bd. of Registration for Professional Eng'rs

            modified by "professional," "registered" or "licensed," or some word of like import does not represent that one is "duly registered and licensed by the Board" and therefore cannot represent that one is a professional engineer as that term

     § 89C-24. Licensure of corporations and business firms that engage in the practice of engineering or land surveying.
    </b>
        </h3>
        <p>
            A corporation or business firm may not engage in the practice of engineering or land surveying in this State unless it is licensed by the Board and has paid an application fee established by the Board in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00).
            A corporation or business firm is subject to the same duties and responsibilities as an individual licensee. Licensure of a corporation or business firm does not affect the requirement that all engineering or land surveying work done by the
            corporation or business firm be performed by or under the responsible charge of individual registrants, nor does it relieve the individual registrants within a corporation or business firm of their design and supervision responsibilities.
            The Board may adopt rules regulating the operation of offices and places of business of corporations and business firms licensed under this section to ensure that professional engineering and land surveying services are performed under the
            supervision of licensed professional engineers and land surveyors.
        </p>
        <p>
            This section applies to every corporation that is engaged in the practice of engineering or land surveying, regardless of when it was incorporated. A corporation that is not exempt from <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55B</a></cite>            of the General Statutes by application of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055B.html#t55Bs55B-15" target="_blank">G.S. 55B-15</a></cite> must be incorporated under that Chapter.
