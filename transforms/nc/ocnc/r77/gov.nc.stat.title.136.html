                <p>
                    Prior to any action of the Board on a transportation project, the Department shall inform all municipalities, counties, and utility providers affected by a planned transportation project and request each to submit within 45 days a written resolution expressing
                    their views on the project. A municipality or county may designate a Transportation Advisory Committee to submit its response to the Department's request for a resolution. Upon receipt of a written resolution from all affected parties
                    or their designees, or the expiration of the 45-day period, whichever occurs first, the Board may take action. The Department and the Board shall consider, but shall not be bound by, the views of the affected parties or their designees
                    on each transportation project. The failure of an affected party to express its views within the time provided shall not prevent the Department or the Board from taking action. The Department shall not be required to send notice under
                    this section if it has already received a written resolution from the affected party on the planned transportation project. "Action of the Board", as used in this section, means approval by the Board of: the Transportation Improvement
                    Program and amendments to the Transportation Improvement Program; the Secondary Roads Paving Program and amendments to the Secondary Roads Paving Program; and individual applications for access and public service road projects, contingency
                    projects, small urban projects, and spot safety projects that exceed two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000). The 45-day notification provision may be waived upon a finding by the Secretary of Transportation that emergency action
                    is required. Such findings must be reported to the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee.

                        Intent. - It is the intent of the General Assembly to take all steps necessary to assist the Department of Transportation in accelerating project delivery and reducing costs incurred by the State. The General Assembly finds that shifting more control
                        over projects to each of the Highway Divisions can assist in achieving this intent. Further, the General Assembly encourages each Highway Division to increase its outsourcing of preconstruction activities to private contractors
                        to sixty percent (60%) of the total cost of preconstruction activities performed by the Highway Division, with the belief that increased outsourcing will also assist in achieving this intent. Therefore, in order to assess the results
                        from shifting project control and increasing the use of outsourcing, and to determine what adjustments may be necessary to improve upon the results, the General Assembly finds that reports are necessary to collect baseline data

      </b> - Session Laws 1999-237, s. 27.3, provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board of Transportation may award up to three contracts annually for construction of transportation projects on a design-build
                    basis after a determination by the Department that delivery of the projects must be expedited and that it is not in the public interest to comply with normal design and construction contracting procedures. Prior to the award of a design-build
                    contract, the Secretary of Transportation is to report to the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee and to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations on the nature and scope of the project and the reasons
                    an award on a design-build basis will best serve the public interest.

                            Constitutional Delegation of Power. - General Assembly's delegation of power to the North Carolina Department of Transportation constituted a constitutional delegation of power because there were adequate guiding standards and procedural safeguards in
                            place to regulate the exercise of authority for a project; a limited liability company had to report to the Turnpike Authority Board prior to any increase in toll rates or change in the toll setting methodology from the previous

                            Constitutional Delegation of Power. - Legislative goals and policies set forth in the P3 Statute, combined with its procedural safeguards to ensure adherence to the legislative standard, are sufficient to withstand a constitutional challenge; the General
                            Assembly has enacted specific guiding standards within the P3 Statute to govern the exercise by the North Carolina Department of Transportation of the delegated powers, and the directions given by the General Assembly are as

                            that the ordinance was in excess of the authority vested in the Commission (now Department) and was unconstitutional. It was held that defendant's demurrer was properly sustained, since injunction will not lie against a State
                            agency to prevent it from committing a wrong. Schloss v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 489</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 517 (1949). See Moore v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 364</cite>,

                            Power to Acquire Residences. - The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) does not have authority to acquire residences, either by purchase or by eminent domain, unless such residence is needed for construction or maintenance of the
                            highway system. De Bruhl v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 139</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 553 (1956).

                            Protecting Integrity of Rights-of-Way. - It is clear that the authority and powers set forth in subdivision (10) of this section are intended to allow the Department of Transportation (DOT) to protect the integrity of its rights-of-way, which are there
                            to begin with to accommodate the construction and maintenance of roads and highways. Baldwin v. GTE S., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 428 S.E.2d 857, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 619</cite>,

                            Department May Control Use of Land Embraced by Easement. - The effect of this section is to give dominance to the easement acquired by the State. Under the terms thereof the Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) has authority to control
                            the uses to which the land embraced within the easement may be put. If it deems it wise or expedient so to do in the interest of the traveling public, it may altogether exclude the imposition of any additional easement or burden.
                            It may not be held that the legislature intended thereby to declare that the construction and maintenance of a telephone line is a legitimate highway purpose and embraced within the easement acquired for highway use. The Commission
                            (now Department) is merely authorized to do whatever is necessary to be done in order to make a safe, convenient, public way for travel, including the right, if necessary, to exclude the owner and others from using any part
                            of the surface of the way for any permanent or private purpose. Hildebrand v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 402</cite>, 14 S.E.2d 252 (1941).

                            post such warnings was a breach of its duty and was the proximate cause of a truck driver's tractor-trailer getting stuck on the crossing and thereafter hit by a train, and there was no contributory negligence by the truck

                            Department Erred in Denying Driveway Permit Application. - The Driveway Permit Statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a02s136-18" target="_self">G.S. 136-18(29)</a></cite>, specifically and unambiguously provides an exclusive
                            list of how DOT may regulate driveway connections, as well as an exclusive list of improvements it may require of an applicant. Because the Driveway Permit Statute treats an owner's access to the state highway system in specific
                            terms, and because it is clear and unambiguous, courts are not permitted to engage in statutory construction. The statute authorized no requirement to make improvements away from the applicant's property, and it similarly failed
                            to empower DOT to require an applicant to obtain another property owner's approval, giving that property owner veto power over the applicant's project. DOT acted in excess of its statutory authority when it conditioned the
                            developer's driveway permit on widening a railroad crossing one-quarter of a mile away from the driveway connection and on the developer's obtaining consent from two railroad companies. High Rock Lake Partners, LLC v. N.C.

                            Substitute Condemnation Described. - Substitute condemnation, provided for by subdivision (16) of this section, is a transaction in which the State or an agency with the power of eminent domain takes land under an agreement to compensate its owner with
                            land to be taken in condemnation proceedings from a third person, instead of with money. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            When Substitute Condemnation Is Valid. - Substitute condemnation, provided for by subdivision (16) of this section, is a valid exercise of a power of eminent domain only when the substitution of other property is the sole method by which the owner of
                            land taken for public use can be justly compensated and the practical problems resulting from the taking can be solved. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>,

                            Substitute condemnation of land for exchange under subdivision (16) of this section can only be justified when the property for which it is substituted accomplishes the public purpose for which it was taken, and the cost is not disproportionate to the
                            benefit derived. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).

                            Condemnation of Property for Exchange for Railroad Right-of-Way. - Under subdivision (16) of this section, the State Highway Commission (now Department) is without authority to condemn land in fee simple for the purpose of exchanging it for railroad right-of-way
                            property to be used in a highway construction project. The Commission (now Department) may only condemn an easement to be used for railroad purposes. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co.,

                            DOT's grant of a driveway permit application off of a private road taken by the DOT was a function of the DOT's police power as a State agency to regulate State highways, not a compensable taking; therefore, evidence regarding the driveway permit and
                            its resulting increase in traffic was excluded from the private road owner's damages trial; this issue was properly determined in a hearing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite>.

                            Closure of Road Not Compensable Taking. - Trial court did not err in concluding the action of the North Carolina Department of Transportation in closing a road that abutted an owner's property was a lawful exercise of police power and, thus, not a compensable
                            taking, because the owner had reasonable means of ingress and egress from the road to the property. DOT v. BB&amp;R, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 775 S.E.2d 8 (2015).

                            Interlocutory Appeals. - North Carolina Department of Transportation's (NCDOT) appeal of an interlocutory procedural order in an inverse condemnation action was dismissed because NCDOT showed no deprivation of a substantial right, as (1) the case had
                            progressed past the point where sovereign immunity could be asserted, (2) sovereign immunity did not bar suit when the state exercised the state's eminent domain power, (3) NCDOT was judicially estopped from denying prior admissions
                            to recording a map placing restrictions on property owners' land, and (4) separation of powers did not bar ordering NCDOT's deposits for estimated compensation. Beroth Oil Co. v. N.C. DOT,

                        citizens. Further, the General Assembly finds that improving the condition of North Carolina's roads requires increased oversight, accountability, innovation, and efficiency. It is the belief of the General Assembly that, through

                                Responsiveness. - The Department shall structure the Program to gather citizen input and shall commit to quickly addressing structural problems and other road hazards on State-maintained roads. Citizens may report potholes, drainage issues, culvert blockages,
                                guardrail repairs, damaged or missing signs, malfunctioning traffic lights, highway debris, or shoulder damage to the Department of Transportation by calling a toll-free telephone number designated by the Department or
                                submitting an online work request through a Web site link designated by the Department. Beginning January 1, 2016, upon receiving a citizen report in accordance with this subdivision, the Department shall either address
                                the reported problem or identify a solution to the reported problem. Excluding potholes, which shall be repaired within two business days of the date the report is received, the Department of Transportation shall properly
                                address (i) safety-related citizen reports no later than 10 business days after the date the report is received and (ii) non-safety-related citizen reports no later than 15 business days after the date the report is received.
                                The Department shall determine, in its discretion, whether a citizen report is safety-related or non-safety-related. The Department shall transmit information received about potholes or other problems on roads not maintained
                                by the State to the appropriate locality within two business days of receiving the citizen report. The Department shall post a monthly report to the Department's performance dashboard Web site on the number of citizen reports

                                and pursuing design build and other processes to collapse project stages. By December 1, 2015, the Department shall establish a baseline unit pricing structure for transportation goods used in highway maintenance and construction
                                projects and set annual targets for three years based on its unit pricing. In forming the baseline unit prices and future targets, the Department shall collect data from each Highway Division on its expenditures on transportation
                                goods during the 2015-2016 fiscal year. Beginning January 1, 2016, no Highway Division shall exceed a ten percent (10%) variance over a baseline unit price set for that year in accordance with this subdivision. The Department
                                of Transportation shall institute annual tracking to monitor pricing variances. The ten percent (10%) maximum variance set under this subdivision is intended to account for regional differences requiring varying product
                                mixes. If a Highway Division exceeds the unit pricing threshold, the Department shall submit a report to the Joint Legislative Transportation Oversight Committee, the Fiscal Research Division of the General Assembly, the
                                chairs of the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee on Transportation, and the chairs of the Senate Appropriations Committee on the Department of Transportation no later than the fifteenth day of February following
                                the end of the calendar year on why the variance occurred and what steps are being taken to bring the Highway Division back into compliance. In order to drive savings, unit pricing may be reduced annually as efficiencies
                                are achieved.

                            or (5) condemnation. Hughes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 162 S.E.2d 661 (1968), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 121</cite>,

                            Extent of Right Acquired by Condemnation. - Where it exercises the power of eminent domain vested in it by this section and in that way appropriates the land of another to public use as the right-of-way for a public highway, the State Highway Commission
                            (now Department of Transportation) acquires once and for all the complete legal right to use the entire right-of-way for highway purposes as long as time shall last. North Carolina State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n v. Black,
                            <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 198</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 778 (1954); Van Leuven v. Akers Motor Lines, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 539</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 640 (1964).

                        <p>
                            Rights Acquired by Purchase. - The purchase of a right-of-way by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), under the provisions of this section, vests in the Commission (now Department) the same rights as though it had acquired
                            the land by condemnation. Sale v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 599</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 724 (1953), modified, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 612</cite>, 89 S.E.2d

                            Purchase from One Cotenant Does Not Affect Interest of Other Cotenant. - The purchase of an easement from one cotenant does not carry with it an easement in the interest of the other cotenant. Browning v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n,
                            <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 130</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 227 (1964).

                            A lessee as tenant of an estate for years takes and holds his term in the same manner as any other owner of realty holds his title, subject to the right of the sovereign to take the hold or any part of it for public use upon the payment to him of just
                            compensation. Givens v. Sellars, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 44</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 530 (1968).

                        <p>
                            A right of access to a public highway is an easement appurtenant to the land. The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) stands in the position of a servient owner with the right to locate an access route under the general rule that
                            where an easement is granted or reserved in general terms, which do not fix a specific location, then the owner of the servient estate has the right in the first instance to designate the specific location of such easement,
                            subject to the limitation that this right be exercised in a reasonable manner with due regard to the rights of the owner of the easement. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite>                            354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                        <p>
                            The right of direct access from the plaintiff's land to the highway, whether it existed prior to the agreement or was created by it, was an easement appurtenant to the plaintiff's land and was a private property right in the plaintiff, over and above
                            the plaintiff's right, as a member of the public, to use this ramp as a means of getting to the lanes of the highway. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite>                            354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                            Which Cannot Be Damaged or Taken Without Compensation. - The owner of land abutting a highway has a right beyond that which is enjoyed by the general public, a special right of easement in the public road for access purposes, and this is a property right
                            which cannot be damaged or taken from him without due compensation. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                        <p>
                            While the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) has the power to eliminate a hazardous access point, it cannot do so without paying the landowner for his property right. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n,
                            <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                        <p>
                            The fact that landowner's right of access arose out of an agreement and a deed does not prevent its being a property right. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d
                            58 (1969).

                            Department May Condemn Right of Access to Public Highway. - The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) has statutory authority to exercise the power of eminent domain to condemn or severely curtail an abutting landowner's right of
                            access to a public highway adjacent to his property, for the construction or reconstruction, maintenance and repair, of a limited-access highway, upon the payment of just compensation. Williams v. North Carolina State Hwy.

                            A right of access is an easement, a property right, and as such is subject to condemnation. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                            No Authority to Appropriate Personal Property. - Lyerly v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 649</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 658 (1965).

                            The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) has no authority to appropriate personal property for public use. Lyerly v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 649</cite>, 142 S.E.2d

                            This section does not authorize State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to appropriate personal property for public use. Midgett v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 241</cite>,
                            132 S.E.2d 599 (1963), overruled on other grounds in Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 603</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 164 (1983).

                            Trial court erred in finding that a billboard was a permanent leasehold improvement and that the owner's lost profits, a Department of Transportation (DOT) permit, and an option to renew the billboard lease were compensable property interests because
                            the DOT was not statutorily authorized to condemn personal property, the external indicia showed that the billboard, structure, and the remaining interests were non-compensable personal property. DOT v. Adams Outdoor Adver.

                            Removal of Personalty from Leasehold Estate. - When a leasehold estate is taken under the power of eminent domain, the ownership of personalty kept on the premises taken, but not permanently affixed thereto, is not affected, and the owner is entitled
                            to remove it at his own expense. Givens v. Sellars, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 44</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 530 (1968).

                            Acquisition of Topsoil. - The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) is authorized by this section to acquire by condemnation topsoil deemed necessary and suitable for road construction, "topsoil" being included in the generic term
                            "earth," and the power to acquire topsoil is not limited to lands contiguous to the highway upon which it is to be used. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n v. Basket, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 221</cite>,

                            Construing Right-of-Way Agreement. - In construing a right-of-way agreement, all of the language contained therein is to be considered, and a landowner can rely upon language creating easement rights and property rights greater than those of the general
                            public. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                            Liability of Contractor. - A contractor who is employed by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to do work incidental to the construction or maintenance of a public highway and who performs such work with proper care and skill
                            cannot be held liable to an owner for damages resulting to property from the performance of the work. The injury to the property in such a case constitutes a taking of the property for public use for highway purposes, and the
                            only remedy available to the owner is a special proceeding against the Commission (now Department) under this section to recover compensation for the property taken or damaged. But if the contractor employed by the Commission
                            (now Department) performs his work in a negligent manner and thereby proximately injures the property of another, he is personally liable to the owner therefor. Moore v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 364</cite>,

                            The existence of a public use is a prerequisite to the right of the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to exercise the power of eminent domain to condemn private property, and final determination as to whether the proposed condemnation
                            and taking of defendants' land by condemnation is for a public use is for judicial determination. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126 (1965).

                            It is elementary law that the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) can condemn property only for a public purpose. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Asheville School, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 556</cite>,

                            What constitutes a public use is a judicial question to be decided by the court as a matter of law. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Asheville School, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 169 S.E.2d 193 (1969),

                            Any highway condemnation proceeding may incite controversy as to whether the proposed road will serve a public or private purpose. This question, when the facts are determined, is one of law for the courts. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Asheville

                            Condemnation of property by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) for the sole purpose of providing a private driveway into adjoining property which had been landlocked as the result of the construction of a controlled access
                            freeway was a taking for a public purpose, where the driveway was constructed in connection with the freeway project and not as a separate and distinct project completely unrelated to any public undertaking, and since the landlocking
                            of the property was a damage to the owners thereof, which if not repaired, would have entitled them to compensation. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v.

                            Merely Laying Out Right-of-Way Is Not "Taking". - The mere laying out of a right-of-way is not in contemplation of law a full appropriation of property. Complete appropriation occurs when the property is actually taken for the specified purpose after
                            due notice to the owner; and the owner's right to compensation arises only from the actual taking or occupation of the property by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation). Browning v. North Carolina

                            Paving Existing Highway Is Not "Taking" or Notice Thereof. - The completion of a project is, in ordinary cases, a clear taking of the owner's property and notice to him of the taking, but this is not true where the project consists of the mere paving
                            of an existing public highway. Such paving, where the rights of the public are unquestioned, would be no assertion of rights over adjacent land or notice to the owners that such rights were being asserted. Browning v. North

                            is constructed, it is a nuisance and a taking of property for public use for which compensation must be paid. Midgett v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 241</cite>,

                            Lowering of Canal Bridge. - Petitioner constructed a canal across a county highway and thereafter maintained the bridge constructed over the canal. The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), upon taking over the highway, constructed
                            a new bridge and later constructed a second new bridge which was some two and one-half inches lower than the first. Petitioner instituted a proceeding under this section to recover compensation upon his contention that the
                            lowering of the bridge interfered with the use of the canal in floating his barge under the bridge. It was held that the use of the canal by petitioner was permissive and subject to the easement for highway purposes, and therefore
                            petitioner was not entitled to recover compensation. Dodge v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 4</cite>, 18 S.E.2d 706 (1942).

                            State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) as for a taking of their property under this section, and the demurrer of the contractor for the Commission (now Department) in plaintiff's action in tort was properly

                            Denial of Access Constitutes Appropriation of Private Property. - Where a right-of-way agreement gave plaintiffs a right of access at a particular spot to the highway to be constructed on the right-of-way, the State Highway Commission's (now Department
                            of Transportation's) refusal to allow plaintiffs to enter upon the highway at the point of the easement constituted a taking or appropriation of private property for which an adequate statutory remedy in the nature of a special
                            proceeding is provided, so that plaintiffs' complaint stating a civil action for breach of the agreement was demurrable. Williams v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 772</cite>,

                            Measure and Elements of Damages Generally. - In proceedings to take land for a public highway, the measure of damages is the difference in the fair market value of the entire tract immediately before and immediately after the taking, the elements upon
                            which the damages are predicated being the fair market value of the land taken and the injury to respondent's remaining land, less any general and special benefits accruing to respondent from the construction of the highway.

                            The measure of damages for the taking of a part of a tract of land for highway purposes is the difference between the fair market value of respondent's land immediately before the taking and the fair market value of the portion left immediately after
                            the taking, which difference embraces compensation for the part taken and compensation for injury to the remaining portion, less general and special benefits resulting to the landowner by the utilization of the property for

                            Where only a part of a tract of land is appropriated for highway purposes, the measure of damages in such proceeding is the difference between the fair market value of the entire tract immediately before the taking and the fair market value of what is
                            left immediately after the taking. The items going to make up this difference embrace compensation for the part taken and compensation for injury to the remaining portion, which is to be offset under the terms of the controlling
                            statute by any general and special benefits resulting to the landowner from the utilization of the property taken for a highway. Robinson v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 120</cite>,

                            Diminution of Value by Cutting Off Access over Private Way or Neighborhood Road to Public Road. - To completely cut off one's access over a private way or neighborhood road to the nearest public road, without providing other reasonable access to a public
                            road, may diminish the value of the land involved to the same extent as if access was denied to a public highway abutting the premises. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 369</cite>,

                            Where a landowner's access to a public highway over a section of neighborhood public road is cut off by the construction of a limited access highway across a portion of his land, leaving no access from the property to a public highway, the deprivation
                            of access affects the value of the property and the landowner is entitled to introduce evidence of such deprivation of access as an element of damages. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 369</cite>,

                            not merely the condition it is in at the time and the use to which it is then applied by the owner. Williams v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 514</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 340 (1960).

                            Undeveloped Property May Not Be Valued on a Per-Lot Basis. - It is proper to show that a particular tract of land is suitable and available for division into lots and is valuable for that purpose, but it is not proper to show the number and value of lots
                            as separated parcels in an imaginary subdivision thereof. In other words, it is not proper for the jury in these cases to consider an undeveloped tract of land as though a subdivision thereon is an accomplished fact. Such undeveloped
                            property may not be valued on per-lot basis. The cost factor is too speculative. Barnes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 378</cite>, 109 S.E.2d 219 (1959).

                        <p>
                            Under proper circumstances a map of a proposed subdivision of undeveloped land is admissible to illustrate and explain the testimony of witnesses as to the highest and best available use of the property and that it is capable of subdivision. But where
                            such map is admitted in evidence, the inclusion of a price per lot noted thereon or by testimony of witnesses is incompetent and should be excluded. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 394</cite>,

                        <p>
                            The fair market value of undeveloped land immediately before condemnation is not a speculative value based on an imaginary subdivision and sales in lots to many purchasers. It is the fair market value of the land as a whole in its then state according
                            to the purpose or purposes to which it is best adapted and in accordance to its best and highest capabilities. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 394</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 553

                            as offsets against any damages which plaintiff might have sustained, and an instruction that limits offsets to special advantages that accrued to plaintiff is erroneous. Bailey v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n,

                            Benefits to Independent Tract May Not Be Offset. - When the State takes a part or all of a tract of land for highway purposes, it is not entitled to offset against damages the benefits to another separate and independent parcel or parcels belonging to
                            the landowner whose land was taken. Barnes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 378</cite>, 109 S.E.2d 219 (1959).

                        <p>
                            Although an adjacent tract was separated from the taken property by an easement and zoned differently, evidence of benefit to that tract was competent to offset damage to property taken. Barnes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n,
                            <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 378</cite>, 109 S.E.2d 219 (1959).

                        <p>
                            Compensatory damages for injury to personal property are the difference between its fair market value immediately before and immediately after the injury. If the property has no market value, the measure of damages may be gauged by the cost of repairs.

                            of the property has increased. John R. Taylor Co. v. North Carolina State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 533</cite>, 109 S.E.2d 243 (1959).

                            Application of Amendment. - At the time of the relocation of a road and when suit was instituted, the rule for the admeasurement of damages was as prescribed by this section prior to the 1923 amendment. Lanier v. Town of Greenville,
                            <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 311</cite>, 93 S.E. 850 (1917). But before trial, the legislature amended the law by adding: "And in all instances the general and special benefits shall be assessed as offsets against damages,"
                            etc. Hence, the law as amended should have been followed in determining the amount plaintiff was entitled to recover. Wade v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 210</cite>, 124 S.E. 193 (1924).

                            fair market value of the property on taking date, interest on such sum at the rate of six percent from the date petitioners were physically dispossessed to the date of verdict, as an element of just compensation guaranteed

                            by one who is under no necessity of buying, will not be held prejudicial for failure to charge that the buyer must be one desiring to buy, when it appears from the entire charge, construed contextually, that the jury could
                            not have been misled but must have understood that the market value was to be determined by what the property would bring by a willing seller, not required to sell, to a wanting buyer, not required to buy. John R. Taylor Co.

                            in the exercise of such power. This procedure must be followed, and the conditions prescribed therein must be met before the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) has the right to exercise the power of

                            North Carolina Department of Transportation's (NCDOT) appeal of an interlocutory procedural order in an inverse condemnation action was dismissed because NCDOT showed no deprivation of a substantial right, as (1) the case had progressed past the point

                            exercises the power of eminent domain. The phrase "eminent domain" by definition admits condemnor did not own, but took or appropriated the property of another for a public purpose. Wescott v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 522</cite>,

                            to compensation because it, not the plaintiff, was the owner of the property rights in controversy, the Commission (now Department) in effect converts what began as a condemnation proceeding into an action in ejectment or trespass
                            to try title. On that issue the plaintiff is entitled to a jury trial. Wescott v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 522</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 133 (1964).

                        proportionate part may be made under such rules and regulations and by such methods as the Department of Transportation may provide. If the Department of Transportation shall undertake to do the work, it shall not obstruct or impair
                        the operation of the railroad and shall keep the roadbed and track safe for the operation of trains at every stage of work. If said railroad company shall construct such underpass or overpass or shall install such safety devices

                        of said work be submitted to the Department of Transportation by the railroad company. If the Department of Transportation shall neglect or refuse to pay that portion of the cost of said construction or installation chargeable
                        to it, the railroad company shall recover the amount thereof by suit therefor against the Department of Transportation in the Superior Court of Wake County.

                        as may be just and proper.

                    requiring them to appear before the court at a time to be named in the summons, which shall not be less than 10 days from the service thereof, and upon such day the petition shall be heard, and the court shall appoint three disinterested
                    persons, one of whom shall be a competent civil and drainage engineer recommended by the Department of Environmental Quality, and the other two of whom shall be resident freeholders of the county or counties in which the road and lands
                    are, in whole or in part, located, as commissioners, who shall, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, be sworn to do justice between the parties.

        Liability of Contractor for Injury.
       </b> - A contractor constructing a highway was not relieved, by an order of the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) closing the road to travel, of liability for injuries in an automobile collision
                        with an unlighted disabled truck left by defendant on the side of the highway, where on the part of the road where the accident happened barriers had been removed and to defendant's knowledge many people habitually traversed it.

                        Contractor Has Duty to Exercise Ordinary Care. - When a contractor undertakes to perform work under contract with the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), the positive legal duty devolves on him to exercise ordinary care for the
                        safety of the general public traveling over the road on which he is working. C.C.T. Equip. Co. v. Hertz Corp., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 277</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 802 (1962).

                        The contractor doing the work is there for a lawful purpose and is not obliged to stop the work every time a traveler drives along. But while the traveler assumes certain risks, he is still a traveler on a public way, and the contractor still owes him
                        due care, and is liable for injuries suffered by him as a result of negligence in the performance of the work. C.C.T. Equip. Co. v. Hertz Corp., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 277</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 802

                    <p>
                        Requirements as to Signs and Flagmen Do Not Give Contractor Special Privileges. - Where a contractor for the improvement of an airport is granted permission by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to construct a dirt ramp over
                        the highway to protect it from heavy equipment, the Commission's (now Department's) requirements with reference to signs and flagmen are primarily for the protection of the users of the highway and do not confer on the contractor
                        special privileges in respect to right-of-way. C.C. Mangum, Inc. v. Gasperson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 32</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 234 (1964).

                        Department Cannot Impose Different Standard of Care. - The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) cannot by contract or by supervisory instructions prescribe for contractors a different standard of care from that imposed by the common
                        law in a given situation, as it affects third parties. But in its use of and authority over a highway, for purposes of construction, repair or maintenance, it may create circumstances which bring into play rules of conduct which
                        would not apply if such purposes were not involved. C.C.T. Equip. Co. v. Hertz Corp., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 277</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 802 (1962).

                    <p>
                        Sufficiency of Warning. - Actual notice of every special obstruction or defect in a highway is not required to be given to a traveler, nor need the way be so barricaded as to preclude all possibility of injury, but it is sufficient if a plain warning
                        of danger is given, and the traveler has notice or knowledge of facts sufficient to put him on inquiry. The test of the sufficiency of the warning is whether the means employed, whatever they may be, are reasonably sufficient for
                        the purpose. C.C.T. Equip. Co. v. Hertz Corp., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 277</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 802 (1962).

                    <p>
                        Red Light or Red Flag. - A red light is recognized by common usage as a method of giving warning of danger during hours of darkness, and a driver seeing a red light ahead in the highway is required in the exercise of due care to heed its warning. The
                        same is equally true of a red flag in daylight hours when properly displayed. C.C.T. Equip. Co. v. Hertz Corp., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 277</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 802 (1962).

                        Care Required of Traveler. - When extraordinary conditions exist on a highway by reason of construction or repair operations, the motorist is required by law to take notice of them. The traveler's care must be commensurate with the obvious danger. C.C.T.
                        Equip. Co. v. Hertz Corp., <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 277</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 802 (1962).

                        One who operates an automobile on a public highway which is under construction or repair, or in use for such purposes, cannot assume that there are no obstructions, defects or dangers ahead. In such instances it is the duty of the motorist, in the exercise
                        of due care, to keep his vehicle under such control that it can be stopped within the distance within which a proper barrier or obstruction, or an obvious danger can be seen. C.C.T. Equip. Co. v. Hertz Corp.,

                        Where travel on the highway was closed temporarily by means of warning signs and flagmen's signals it was the duty of the motorist to stop and yield the right-of-way to the contractor's earth movers. C.C. Mangum, Inc. v. Gasperson,

                <p>
                    When any portion of the State highway system shall run through any city or town and it shall be found necessary to connect the State highway system with improved streets of such city or town as may be designated as part of such system, the Department
                    of Transportation shall build such connecting links, the same to be uniform in dimensions and materials with such State highways: Provided, however, that whenever any city or town may desire to widen its streets which may be traversed
                    by the State highway, the Department of Transportation may make such arrangements with said city or town in connection with the construction of said road as, in its discretion, may seem wise and just under all the facts and circumstances
                    in connection therewith: Provided further, that such city or town shall save the Department of Transportation harmless from any claims for damage arising from the construction of said road through such city or town and including claims
                    for rights-of-way, change of grade line, and interference with public-service structures. And the Department of Transportation may require such city or town to cause to be laid all water, sewer, gas or other pipelines or conduits,
                    together with all necessary house or lot connections or services, to the curb line of such road or street to be constructed: Provided further, that whenever by agreement with the road governing body of any city or town any street designated
                    as a part of the State highway system shall be surfaced by order of the Department of Transportation at the expense, in whole or in part, of a city or town it shall be lawful for the governing body of such city or town to declare an
                    assessment district as to the street to be improved, without petition by the owners of property abutting thereon, and the costs thereof, exclusive of so much of the cost as is incurred at street intersections and the share of railroads
                    or street railways whose tracks are laid in said street, which shall be assessed under their franchise, shall be specially assessed upon the lots or parcels of land abutting directly on the improvements, according to the extent of

                        City Has Power to Condemn Land. - Under authority of this section a city has the power and authority to condemn land which is wholly within its limits for a street, and the fact that the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) has
                        aided in the construction of the street within the city limits and relieved the city, is for the benefit of the city and in no way abridges the city's power and authority to condemn the land. City of Raleigh v. Hatcher,

                        Power of City to Voluntarily Improve. - Where a city or incorporated town having three thousand inhabitants, or more, has a considerable portion of its streets hard surfaced, the municipality may voluntarily assess and undertake the improvement of a street

                        Sovereign Immunity - When the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) entered into an agreement with a developer to jointly fund a roadway to be built to State specifications by a contractor selected by the developer, which NCDOT approved,
                        due to the involvement of public funds in the project, the contract was not let pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a02s136-28.1" target="_self">G.S. 136-28.1</a></cite>, but, rather, was entered
                        into pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a02s136-28.6" target="_self">G.S. 136-28.6</a></cite>, so when the developer did not pay the contractor, NCDOT was not liable to the contractor because it did not contract with
                        the contractor and, therefore, did not waive its sovereign immunity as to the contractor. Rifenburg Constr., Inc. v. Brier Creek Assocs., L.P., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 586 S.E.2d 812 (2003), aff'd sub nom.,

                    The Department of Transportation is authorized to permit power companies and governmental agencies, including agencies of the federal government, when it is necessary to relocate transportation infrastructure by reason of the construction of a dam, to
                    let contracts for the construction of the relocated transportation infrastructure. The construction shall be in accordance with the Department of Transportation standards and specifications. The Department of Transportation is further
                    authorized to reimburse the power company or governmental agency for betterments arising out of the construction of the relocated transportation infrastructure, provided the bidding and the award is in accordance with the Department
                    of Transportation's regulations and the Department of Transportation approves the award of the contract.

                        tailored remedies identified in the Study, and the Department shall implement a comprehensive antidiscrimination enforcement policy. As appropriate, the program design shall be modified by rules adopted by the Department that are

                        goal for the participation of such firms in a manner consistent with availability of disadvantaged minority-owned and women-owned businesses, as appropriately defined by its most recent Study. Nothing in this section shall authorize
                        the use of quotas. Any program implemented as a result of the Study conducted in accordance with this section shall be narrowly tailored to eliminate the effects of historical and continuing discrimination and its impacts on such

The public-sector evidence as a whole did not evince the exceedingly persuasive justification
                        the United States Supreme Court required, the State of North Carolina did not present evidence indicating the extent to which women-owned businesses competing on public-sector road projects - the targets of the remedial statute
                        - vied for private-sector subcontracts in the general construction industry, it also failed to present any anecdotal evidence indicating that women subcontractors successfully bidding on State contracts faced private-sector discrimination,
                        and it could not overcome the strong evidence of overutilization in the public sector; the statute was also unconstitutional as applied to Asian American, and Hispanic American subcontractors. H.B. Rowe Co., Inc. v. Tippett, 615

                        Section Does Not Offend Constitutional Right to Jury. - The constitutional guarantee of trial by jury applies only where the prerogative existed at common law or by statute at the time the Constitution was adopted. Prior to the enactment of this statute,
                        and certainly at common law, a contractor could not institute this action against the State due to the doctrine of sovereign immunity. The right itself was created by this statute which never intended nor provided for a trial by
                        jury. Therefore, the statute does not offend the constitutional guarantee to trial by jury. Huyck Corp. v. C.C. Mangum, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 788</cite>, 309 S.E.2d 183 (1983).

                        Construction of Section. - In determining whether this section authorizes a suit, the district court notes the principle that statutes in derogation of the common law are generally construed strictly. On the other hand, as a remedial statute, it ought
                        to receive from the courts such a construction as will remedy the existing evil so as to advance the remedy and permit the courts to bring the parties to an issue. Wilmington Shipyard, Inc. v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n,
                        <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 171 S.E.2d 222 (1969).

                    <p>
                        The rule that statutes waiving governmental immunity must be strictly construed does not compel the court to take the strictest possible view of this section, permitting suit against the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) on claims
                        arising out of construction contracts, but the district court will simply examine the language of the statute within its context, mindful of the principle that the intent of the legislature controls the interpretation of a statute.

                        The sole statutory grounds that allow suit against the State Highway Administrator are provided in this section. In re Thompson-Arthur Paving Co., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 645, 344 S.E.2d 853, cert. denied,

                        Contractor's Substantive Rights Not Expanded. - Although this section, as amended in 1983, terms the board an alternative to civil suit, the claim allowed to the board is nevertheless a waiver of sovereign immunity, the terms of which are to be strictly
                        construed. The same restrictions on maintaining a claim to the board as those for a claim to superior court will be applied, for there is no language, express or implied, that the creation of this alternative was to expand the
                        substantive rights of the contractor against the sovereign immunity of the State. In re Thompson-Arthur Paving Co., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 645, 344 S.E.2d 853, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 506</cite>,

                        Former Methods for Presenting Claims. - Prior to enactment of this section, one who had any claim growing out of a contract with the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) could not bring suit against the Commission (now Department),
                        for it is a State agency and no consent to suit has been given. The claimant might present his claim to the General Assembly or he might invoke the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The latter course was not very satisfactory
                        for the court has said that in such a proceeding it will consider only questions of law. The decision of the court, if in favor of the claimant, was simply recommendatory and was reported to the next General Assembly for its action.

                        Section Constitutes Remedy in Action on Contract. - Subsection (d) of this section provides that the statute is deemed to be a part of "every contract" between Department of Transportation and "any contractor," and this section is therefore a remedy in
                        an action upon such contract. Huyck Corp. v. C.C. Mangum, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 532, 293 S.E.2d 846 (1982), rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 788</cite>, 309 S.E.2d

                        Section Assumes Valid Contract Is Subsisting. - The procedure under this section is available when the contractor has completed his contract with the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) and fails to receive "such settlement as
                        he claims to be entitled to under his contract." This assumes a valid contract is subsisting. Nello L. Teer Co. v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 1</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 247

                        When the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) entered into an agreement with a developer to jointly fund a roadway to be built to State specifications by a contractor selected by the developer, which NCDOT approved, due to the involvement
                        of public funds in the project, and the developer did not pay the contractor, the contractor could not sue NCDOT under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a02s136-29" target="_self">G.S. 136-29</a></cite> because
                        NCDOT was neither a joint venturer nor a partner with the developer, and the contractor had not completed a contract with NCDOT under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a02s136-28.1" target="_self">G.S. 136-28.1</a></cite>.

                        Administrative Remedies Must First Be Pursued. - Before a party may pursue a judicial action against the State for money claimed to be due under a highway construction contract, it must first pursue its administrative remedies. Huyck Corp. v. C.C. Mangum,

                    <p>
                        Clearly, the requirement of proceeding first through administrative channels for a resolution of a claim and the requirement that if the claimant receives an adverse ruling a suit must be instituted within six months are conditions precedent and do not
                        preempt the Rules of Civil Procedure. These conditions must be satisfied to vest the trial court with jurisdiction to hear the action. C.W. Matthews Contracting Co. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite>                        317, 330 S.E.2d 630 (1985).

                        more than 60 days after the contractor received NCDOT's payment on the final estimate for a bridge project, and thus, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action. A.H. Beck Found. Co. v. Jones Bros.,

                        was received by the contractor within the purview of this section on the date he received a letter returning the warrant with notation permitting its negotiation without jeopardizing the contractor's claim, and the filing of claim

                        the status of the final estimate; the contractor's verified claim, filed 76 days after receipt of the final estimate payment, was untimely. A.H. Beck Found. Co. v. Jones Bros., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 603

                        brought by a party not privy to the contract. To compel a contractor to proceed first upon the settlement procedure of this section before joining the State and Department of Transportation in an action already filed could result
                        in a forfeiture of that remedy under these circumstances. Huyck Corp. v. C.C. Mangum, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 532, 293 S.E.2d 846 (1982), rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 788</cite>,

                        the benefit of the defendant, made it abundantly clear that any such claims not recognized in the separate categories as presented were to be included in an overall "changed conditions" claim, it was held that plaintiff did not

                    Session Laws 2010-180, s. 17(a), provides: "The General Assembly finds and declares that inorganic arsenic is a hazardous substance and is recognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Occupational Safety and Health
                    Administration as a human carcinogen; that release of this substance into the environment may lead to contamination of soil and water; that the ingestion or inhalation of soil, water, plant material, or animal tissues contaminated
                    with inorganic arsenic may lead to lung cancer, damage to the nervous system, or, in extreme cases, death from systemic poisoning; that reflective glass beads are used to reflect light when applied to roadway markers; that glass beads
                    that contain more than 75 parts per million inorganic arsenic may represent a danger to workers who handle and apply them and a contamination potential to soil and water surrounding roadways. The General Assembly therefore determines
                    that it is in the public interest to prohibit the use of glass beads containing more than 75 parts per million inorganic arsenic used to reflect light when applied to markings on roadways."

                    employment,' and the human service transportation management and rural general public grant programs within the 'urban technology, human service transportation management and rural general public' grant programs. The Highway Fund Budget
                    Code 84210, Fund Code 7831, shall be changed to reflect these consolidations and the separation of the 'urban technology, human service transportation management and rural general public' grant program. The grant categories and respective

                <p>
                    "Consolidating the funding sources should enable the Department to increase utilization of all available funds based on documented local needs, reduce program administration at the State and local levels, and increase flexibility for regional systems
                    to apply and expend funds for multicounty transit needs."

                    seats, and to all principal towns, State parks, and principal State institutions, and linking up with state highways of adjoining states and with national highways into national forest reserves by the most practical routes, with special
                    view of development of agriculture, commercial and natural resources of the State, and, except as otherwise provided by law, for the further purpose of permitting the State to assume control of the State highways, repair, construct,
                    and reconstruct and maintain said highways at the expense of the entire State, and to relieve the counties and cities and towns of the State of this burden.

                        implied notice of the powers conferred upon the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) in changing the route, and could not maintain the position that they had been deprived of in violation of the due-process-of-law
                        provision in the Constitution, whether of a vested right or otherwise. Cameron v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 84</cite>, 123 S.E. 465 (1924).

                        of its subagencies, and an action may not be maintained against it or a county acting thereunder in trespassing upon the lands of a private owner, or for the faulty construction of its drains, or the taking of a part of the lands
                        of such owner for the use of the highway, the remedy prescribed by the statute being exclusive. Latham v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 141</cite>, 131 S.E. 385 (1926).

        Liability for Defects in Highway.
       </b> - Counties in North Carolina are not liable for damage resulting from defective condition of their highways, being political agencies of the State; nor are county commissioners individually liable, unless they acted

                        An individual user of a street, which is part of the State highway system, who sustains personal injuries or property damage as the result of a dangerous condition of such street, cannot maintain an action for damages against a city which contracted with
                        the Department of Transportation to repair or remove such condition and then did nothing whatsoever about it. Matternes v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 1</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 481 (1974).

                        Power of County Commissioners and Department to Contract. - The boards of county commissioners and the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) are vested with powers to enter into contracts and agreements for the construction of roads
                        forming a part of the State highway system. Young v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 52</cite>, 128 S.E. 401 (1925).

                        Actions in Regard to Condemnation. - The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) is an unincorporated agency of the State, charged with the duty of exercising certain governmental functions, and like the State may only be sued by a
                        citizen when authority is granted by the General Assembly, and the methods prescribed for the entertainment of such an action are exclusive. While the various acts creating the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation)
                        and prescribing its powers and duties do not declare in so many words that it may "sue and be sued," it sufficiently appears from the language of the statutes that in the matter of condemnation of land for highway purposes, and
                        with respect to the method of arriving at compensation therefor, right of action lies in the manner set out by the statutes, and the procedure prescribed is open to the property owner as well as to the State Highway Commission
                        (now Department of Transportation). Yancey v. North Carolina State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 106</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 256 (1942).

                        Department Has No Power to Condemn Property for Private Use. - This section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a02s136-18" target="_self">G.S. 136-18</a></cite> vest in the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation)

                <p>
                    From and after July 1, 1931, the exclusive control and management and responsibility for all public roads in the several counties shall be vested in the Department of Transportation as hereinafter provided, and all county, district, and township highway
                    or road commissioners, by whatever name designated, and whether created under public, public-local, or private acts, shall be abolished:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Provided, that for the purpose of providing for the payment of any bonded or other indebtedness, and for the interest thereon, that may be outstanding as an obligation of any county, district, or township commission herein abolished, the boards of county
                    commissioners of the respective counties are hereby constituted fiscal agents, and are vested with authority and it shall be their duty to levy such taxes on the taxable property or persons within the respective county, district, or
                    township by or for which said bonds or other indebtedness were issued or incurred and as are now authorized by law to the extent that the same may be necessary to provide for the payment of such obligations; and the respective commissions
                    herein abolished shall on or before July 1, 1931, turn over to said boards of county commissioners any moneys on hand or evidences of indebtedness properly applicable to the discharge of any such indebtedness (except such moneys as
                    are mentioned in paragraph (a) above); and all uncollected special road taxes shall be payable to said boards of county commissioners, and the portion of said taxes applicable to indebtedness shall be applied by said commissioners
                    to said indebtedness, or invested in a sinking fund according to law. All that portion of said taxes or other funds coming into the hands of said county commissioners and properly applicable to the maintenance or improvement of the
                    public roads of the county shall be held by them as a special road fund and disbursed upon proper orders of the Department of Transportation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Provided, further, that in order to fully carry out the provisions of this section the respective boards of county commissioners are vested with full authority to prosecute all suitable legal actions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing in this section shall prevent a county from participating in the cost of rights-of-way, construction, reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance of a road on the State highway system under agreement with the Department of Transportation. A county
                    is authorized and empowered to acquire land by dedication and acceptance, purchase, or eminent domain and make improvements to portions of the State highway system lying within or outside the county limits utilizing local funds that
                    have been authorized for that purpose. The provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html#t153Aa02s153A-15" target="_blank">G.S. 153A-15</a></cite> apply to any county attempting to acquire

                        also be exceptions to this section: (1) when public officers whose duty it is to supervise and direct a State agency attempt to enforce an invalid ordinance or regulation, or invade or threaten to invade the personal or property
                        rights of a citizen in disregard to law; and (2) where plaintiffs have asserted their status as taxpayers and are trying to prevent the expenditure of money unauthorized by statute or in disregard to law. Orange County Sensible

                        Department Is Responsible for City Street in State System. - When a city street becomes a part of the State highway system, the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) is responsible for its condition thereafter to the same extent
                        as if originally constructed by it; and this applies to the fill and culvert as well as to the surface areas of the highway. Sherrill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 643</cite>,

                        obligation with reference to the construction, maintenance and repair of all city streets, including culverts which support city streets, which constitute a part of the State highway system. Milner Hotels, Inc. v. City of Raleigh,

                        Reasons for Deletion of Street from State Highway System. - When read together, this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a3As136-66.2" target="_self">G.S. 136-66.2</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a3As136-66.3" target="_self">G.S. 136-66.3</a></cite>                        indicate that a municipal street or road is included within the State highway system because it possesses certain characteristics that distinguish it from other streets in the municipality. From the language in the applicable statutes,
                        these characteristics relate primarily to the function served by the particular street. In contrast, public roads not within municipalities are part of the State highway system not because of their function, but because of their
                        geographic location outside the corporate limits of a municipality. Thus, there is a qualitative distinction between roads which are a part of the State highway system because they are not within a municipality and roads which
                        are in a municipality but are nevertheless part of the State highway system because of the function they serve. It follows logically that the reasons justifying deletion of a street from the State system and incorporating it into
                        a municipality system will vary according to the reasons why it was in the State system to begin with. City of Raleigh v. Riley, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 308 S.E.2d 464 (1983).

                        Municipality May Not Contract to Take Over Obligations of Department. - This section and G.S. 160-54 (now repealed) and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a07s136-93" target="_self">G.S. 136-93</a></cite> do not authorize a municipality,
                        in the absence of specific legislative authority, to contract to take over the responsibilities of the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) with reference to the construction, maintenance and repair of city
                        streets and supporting culverts which constitute a part of the State highway system. Milner Hotels, Inc. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 224</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 543 (1967).

                        City Not Responsible for Controlled Access Areas. - All areas within the boundaries of the "controlled access" area are part of the State Highway system and were excepted from contract between the city and NCDOT; thus, city was not responsible for dangerous
                        conditions within the "controlled access" areas. Eakes v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 551, 481 S.E.2d 403 (1997).

                        Liability of City When Maintenance Contracted. - An individual user of a street, which is part of the State highway system, who sustains personal injuries or property damage as the result of a dangerous condition of such street, cannot maintain an action
                        for damages against a city which contracted with the Department of Transportation to repair or remove such condition and then did nothing whatsoever about it. Matternes v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 1</cite>,

                        Limited Liability of City When Street Becomes Part of State System. - When a city street becomes a part of the State highway system, the Board of Transportation is responsible for its maintenance thereafter which includes the control of all signs and
                        structures within the right-of-way. Therefore, in the absence of any control over a State highway within its border, a municipality has no liability for injuries resulting from a dangerous condition of such street unless it created
                        or increased such condition. Shapiro v. Toyota Motor Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 248 S.E.2d 868 (1978).

                        City Had No Responsibility for Maintenance or Condition of Traffic Signal. - Where the portions of roads in question were part of the State highway system, and as such, the responsibility of the N.C. Department of Transportation (NCDOT), apart from its
                        contract with the NCDOT, city had no responsibility for the maintenance or condition of the traffic signal in question. Colombo v. Dorrity, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 443 S.E.2d 752,

                        Trial court did not err in granting a town and municipal employees summary judgment in a driver's action alleging that they negligently failed to establish the proper road design, speed limit, or traffic control devices on the street where the accident
                        occurred because the driver failed to produce any evidence that the town and employees owed a legal duty to regulate the design, site distance, speed limit, or any other features of the street, and there was no evidence that the
                        view on the street where the accident occurred was obstructed; the driver was able to see a stop sign in time to stop at an intersection, and she failed to produce any evidence of a defect in the condition of the street or any
                        question about the adequacy of the stop sign to alert drivers of the need to stop. Blackwell v. Hatley, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 208, 688 S.E.2d 742 (2010).

                        Reasons for Deletion of Street from State Highway System. - When read together, this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a3As136-66.1" target="_self">G.S. 136-66.1</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a3As136-66.3" target="_self">G.S. 136-66.3</a></cite>                        indicate that a municipal street or road is included within the State highway system because it possesses certain characteristics that distinguish it from other streets in the municipality. From the language in the applicable statutes,
                        these characteristics relate primarily to the function served by the particular street. In contrast, public roads not within municipalities are part of the State highway system not because of their function, but because of their
                        geographic location outside the corporate limits of a municipality. Thus, there is a qualitative distinction between roads which are a part of the State highway system because they are not within a municipality and roads which
                        are in a municipality but are nevertheless part of the State highway system because of the function they serve. It follows logically that the reasons justifying deletion of a street from the State system and incorporating it into
                        a municipality system will vary according to the reasons why it was in the State system to begin with. City of Raleigh v. Riley, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 308 S.E.2d 464 (1983).

                        Section does not apply to streets within municipalities that are not part of the State highway system or that have been properly deleted therefrom. City of Raleigh v. Riley, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 308 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Reasons for Deletion of Street from State Highway System. - When read together, this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a3As136-66.1" target="_self">G.S. 136-66.1</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a3As136-66.2" target="_self">G.S. 136-66.2</a></cite>                        indicate that a municipal street or road is included within the State highway system because it possesses certain characteristics that distinguish it from other streets in the municipality. From the language in the applicable statutes,
                        these characteristics relate primarily to the function served by the particular street. In contrast, public roads not within municipalities are part of the State highway system not because of their function, but because of their
                        geographic location outside the corporate limits of a municipality. Thus, there is a qualitative distinction between roads which are a part of the State highway system because they are not within a municipality and roads which
                        are in a municipality but are nevertheless part of the State highway system because of the function they serve. It follows logically that the reasons justifying deletion of a street from the State system and incorporating it into
                        a municipality system will vary according to the reasons why it was in the State system to begin with. City of Raleigh v. Riley, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 308 S.E.2d 464 (1983).

                        requires the city to furnish to the Board of Transportation sufficient information to allow it to make a proper decision. City of Raleigh v. Riley, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 308 S.E.2d

                <p>
                    All those portions of the public road system of the State which have not been taken over and placed under maintenance or which have been abandoned by the Department of Transportation, but which remain open and in general use as a necessary means of ingress
                    to and egress from the dwelling house of one or more families, and all those roads that have been laid out, constructed, or reconstructed with unemployment relief funds under the supervision of the Department of Health and Human Services,
                    and all other roads or streets or portions of roads or streets whatsoever outside of the boundaries of any incorporated city or town in the State which serve a public use and as a means of ingress or egress for one or more families,
                    regardless of whether the same have ever been a portion of any State or county road system, are hereby declared to be neighborhood public roads and they shall be subject to all of the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a04s136-68" target="_self">G.S. 136-68</a></cite>,
                    136-69 and 136-70 with respect to the alteration, extension, or discontinuance thereof, and any interested party is authorized to institute such proceeding, and in lieu of personal service with respect to this class of roads, notice
                    by publication once a week in any newspaper published in said county, or in the event there is no such newspaper, by posting at the courthouse door and three other public places, shall be deemed sufficient: Provided, that this definition
                    of neighborhood public roads shall not be construed to embrace any street, road or driveway that serves an essentially private use, and all those portions and segments of old roads, formerly a part of the public road system, which
                    have not been taken over and placed under maintenance and which have been abandoned by the Department of Transportation and which do not serve as a necessary means of ingress to and egress from an occupied dwelling house are hereby
                    specifically excluded from the definition of neighborhood public roads, and the owner of the land, burdened with such portions and segments of such old roads, is hereby invested with the easement or right-of-way for such old roads
                    heretofore existing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon request of the board of county commissioners of any county, the Department of Transportation is permitted, but is not required, to place such neighborhood public roads as above defined in a passable condition without incorporating the same into the
                    State or county system, and without becoming obligated in any manner for the permanent maintenance thereof.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section shall not authorize the reopening on abandoned roads of any railroad grade crossing that has been closed by order of the Department of Transportation in connection with the building of an overhead bridge or underpass to take the place of
                    such grade crossing.

                            Purpose of Section. - See Speight v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 492</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 371 (1946).

                        <p>
                            Legislative Intent. - In enacting this section, the legislature intended to preserve the public right to use roads that would no longer be maintained by any government. Jarvis v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            355, 343 S.E.2d 195 (1986).

                        <p>
                            The legislature in 1933 did not intend for courts to further whittle down the portions of roads referred to in this section to the bare necessary access routes between dwellings and State roads. Jarvis v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                            355, 343 S.E.2d 195 (1986).

                        <p>
                            History of Section. - The first statutory definition of neighborhood public road was enacted in 1933. The "private use" exclusion was added by amendment in 1941. And the remainder of the proviso, beginning after the phrase "essentially private use," was
                            added in 1949. Jarvis v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 343 S.E.2d 195 (1986).

                            Easements in Abandoned Roads Retained for Use by Public. - By this section, the easements theretofore owned by the State in and to segments of abandoned road are retained and reserved by the State for use by the public, not as public highways but as neighborhood
                            public roads. Every segment of public road which has been abandoned as a part of the State road system coming within the terms of the statute is thus, by legislative enactment, established as a neighborhood public road. Woody

                            Date of Determination of Roadway's Status. - The declaratory language used by the legislature in this section indicates the legislature's intention for the status of roadways to be determined as of the enactment dates of the applicable statutory definitions
                            and exceptions. Jarvis v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 343 S.E.2d 195 (1986).

                            This section declares three distinct types of roads to be neighborhood public roads. The first portion of the section concerns only those roads which were once a part of the "public road system." The second type of road declared by this section to be
                            a neighborhood public road was all those roads that had been laid out, constructed, or reconstructed with unemployment relief funds under the supervision of the Department of Public Welfare (now the Department of Human Resources).
                            The third type declared by this section to be a neighborhood public road (after the 1941 and 1949 revisions) was all those roads outside the boundaries of municipal corporations which served a public use and as a means of ingress
                            and egress for one or more families. Walton v. Meir, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 188 S.E.2d 56, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 515</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 35 (1972); West
                            v. Slick, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 33</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 601 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Provisos Distinguished. - The proviso that no road serving an "essentially private use" could be declared a neighborhood public road should be distinguished from the requirement under the third definition that a road must have served a public use. The
                            proviso allows for some public use, but requires a determination of whether the road was "essentially" a private or a public roadway. Jarvis v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 355,
                            343 S.E.2d 195 (1986).

                        <p>
                            Applicability of Section to Roads Constituting "Necessary" Access to Dwelling. - The first part of this section, relating to roads which were once a part of the public road system, applies only to a road or roads which constitute a "necessary" access
                            to a dwelling house. West v. Slick, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 33</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 601 (1985).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under third part of this section, the elements required to be shown to establish a neighborhood public road are: (1) the road or street or portions thereof are outside the boundaries of any incorporated city or town, (2) serve a public use, and (3) serve
                            as a means of ingress or egress, (4) for one or more families. This third part refers to traveled ways which were established easements or roads or streets in a legal sense at the time of the 1941 amendment to this section.
                            West v. Slick, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 33</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 601 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Section Applies Only to Established Easements and Roads. - This section refers to traveled ways which were at the time of the adoption of Session Laws 1941, c. 183, established easements or roads or streets in a legal sense, and it cannot be construed
                            to include ways of ingress and egress existing by consent of the landowner as a courtesy to a neighbor, nor to those adversely used for a time insufficient to create an easement. Speight v. Anderson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 492</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 371 (1946); Walton v. Meir, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 188 S.E.2d 56, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 515</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 35 (1972).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The position of the "private use" proviso at the end of the entire, unified definitional part of this section indicates the probable intent of the legislature that the proviso be applied to each definition. Jarvis v. Powers,
                            <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 343 S.E.2d 195 (1986), remanding for a determination of whether roadway served "an essentially private purpose" in 1941.
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No road serving an essentially private use is embraced in the definition of neighborhood public road. Walton v. Meir, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 188 S.E.2d 56, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 515</cite>,
                            189 S.E.2d 35 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The proviso at the end of the first paragraph of this section makes clear the legislative intent that no road serving an essentially "private use" is embraced in the definition of neighborhood public road. Watkins v. Smith,
                            <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 253 S.E.2d 354 (1979).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Road Serving Only Landowners, Their Guests and Invitees. - A road which served only as a driveway for the defendants and, until it was obstructed, as a driveway for the plaintiffs, their guests and invitees, is not a neighborhood public road within the
                            meaning of this section. Walton v. Meir, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 188 S.E.2d 56, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 515</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 35 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where roadway was used by defendants and their guests and invitees and by plaintiffs and their guests and invitees, such a road or driveway was not a neighborhood public road within the meaning of this section. Watkins v. Smith,
                            <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 253 S.E.2d 354 (1979).

                            Road Maintained for Convenience of Landowner's Tenants. - Where all the evidence tended to show that the road in question was laid out and maintained primarily as a convenience for those who resided on defendants' tracts, no continuous use for a public
                            purpose was disclosed within the meaning of this section. Speight v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 492</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 371 (1946).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Treatment of Roadway as Single Unit. - The fact that part of a roadway which petitioners sought to establish as a "neighborhood public road" grew in with trees and other plants in the late 1940's or that a portion was claimed under a deed was immaterial
                            under this section, and the court did not err in treating it as a single unit. Jarvis v. Powers, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 343 S.E.2d 195 (1986).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A jury finding that a road was constructed with unemployment relief funds is not, standing alone, sufficient to sustain a judgment that a cartway was a neighborhood public road in the absence of a finding that it serves a public rather than a private
                            use. Walton v. Meir, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 188 S.E.2d 56, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 515</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 35 (1972).

                            Where it was controverted whether the road in question was used permissively as a way to a private cemetery or whether it was used by the public under claim of right to a community cemetery, petitioners were not entitled to have it adjudicated a neighborhood
                            public road solely upon a finding by the jury that it was constructed or reconstructed with employment relief funds under the supervision of the Department of Public Welfare (now Department of Human Resources). Raynor v. Ottoway,

                            Testimony that relief funds were used under authorization of the Department of Public Welfare (now Department of Human Resources) on a cemetery project and that the supervisor in charge of the work, upon suggestion of an interested worker, had the workers
                            improve the road to the cemetery, was held insufficient to establish that the reconstruction of the road was authorized or directed by the Department of Public Welfare (now Department of Human Resources) within the meaning

                            Relocation of Short Section to Cut Out Dangerous Curves or Inadequate Underpass. - Where the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), in the interest of public safety, builds an overpass and relocates a short section of the road in
                            order to cut out dangerous curves and an inadequate underpass, and thereafter tears up the section of old road lying on one side of the underpass, the short section of old road is not a highway abandoned by the Commission (now
                            Department) which remains open and in general use by the public within the purview of this section and does not become a public road. Mosteller v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 275</cite>,

                            Elimination of Dangerous Grade Intersection Underpass or Overpass. - Every segment of a public road which has been abandoned as a part of the State road system coming within the terms of this section is, by legislative enactment, established as a neighborhood
                            public road; however, the elimination by the Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) of a section of a road so as to exclude a dangerous grade intersection underpass or overpass is not a segment of an abandoned
                            road "which remain(s) open and in general use" by the public so as to qualify it as a neighborhood road which must be kept open. Snow v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 169</cite>,

                            Procedure for Establishment or Discontinuance of Neighborhood Road. - The procedure for the establishment of a neighborhood public road, as well as the procedure to establish discontinuance thereof, is by special proceeding before the clerk, and although
                            an interlocutory injunction in connection with the proceeding under the statute may be issued only by the judge, the superior court does not have original jurisdiction of the proceeding. Edwards v. Hunter,

                        <p>
                            Special Procedure for Discontinuance of Road. - The question of the discontinuance of a road which is a neighborhood public road, within the meaning of this section, must be determined by a special proceeding instituted before the clerk; and where the
                            question has been presented by petition to the board of county commissioners, the judgment of the superior court on appeal dismissing the petition is correct, but that part of the judgment providing that the road shall remain
                            open is erroneous and will be stricken out on further appeal. In re Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 549</cite>, 174 S.E. 505 (1934).

                            Who May Maintain Proceeding. - Persons living along a highway which had been taken over by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), and subsequently abandoned by it, are "interested citizens" within the meaning of this section,
                            and may maintain a proceeding to have the road established as a "neighborhood public road." Grady v. Grady, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 749</cite>, 184 S.E. 512 (1936).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where plaintiff's allegations and evidence tended to show that the alleged public way to an old wharf had been abandoned by the Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) when it took over the county roads, and that plaintiffs did not reside
                            along the alleged public road, and that it was not necessary to them as a way of egress and ingress to their homes, but that they used same in getting to the old wharf to their boats for hunting and fishing parties, they failed
                            to establish their right to the use of the passway as a neighborhood public road. Cahoon v. Roughton, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 116</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 362 (1939).

                            Complaint Must Allege Road Is Neighborhood Public Road or Refer to This Article. - An action seeking to enjoin defendants from obstructing an alleged public road, in which the complaint does not allege that the road in controversy is a neighborhood public
                            road nor refer to this Article, is not one to establish a neighborhood public road under this Chapter. Gragg v. Burns, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 240, 175 S.E.2d 774 (1970).

                            Cartway's Effect on Prescriptive Easement. - Where the establishment of a cartway by petitioners' predecessor in title interrupted continuity of use, the petitioners failed to present evidence of the existence of a prescriptive easement and to make out
                            a prima facie case that the road to their house, which the respondents had threatened to block off, was a public road. Roten v. Critcher, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 521 S.E.2d

                            Use of Word "Declare" in Petition. - Where the petitioners seek to obtain a judicial declaration of the existence of those facts which are necessary to bring the road in question within the definition contained in this section, so as to procure the establishment
                            thereof as a neighborhood public road as a matter of public record, they do not invoke the provisions of the Declaratory Judgment Act by the use of the word "declare," and the clerk of the superior court has jurisdiction over
                            the proceeding. Woody v. Barnett, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 73</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 810 (1952).

                            Sufficiency of Evidence. - Evidence that prior to 1929 a road existed across certain lands from a river to another highway, that such way was used by the public at large, at its convenience, in going to fishing camps located on the river, but that the
                            road was not taken over for maintenance by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), is sufficient to be submitted to the jury as to whether such road remained a neighborhood public road. Smith v. Moore,
                            <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 186</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 436 (1961).

                        <p>
                            Evidence was insufficient to support a finding that a road was a public road, but was sufficient to support a finding that it was a neighborhood public road within the meaning of this section. Wetherington v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 493</cite>,
                            131 S.E.2d 33 (1963).

                            Findings Supporting Dismissal of Action. - Where an action to have a portion of abandoned highway adjudged to be a neighborhood public road under this section was submitted to the court under agreement of the parties, findings of fact by the court, supported
                            by evidence, to the effect that the abandoned road was not necessary for ingress or egress to any dwelling, there having been byroads constructed giving access to the dwelling in question and connecting the schools involved,
                            and that the abandoned road had not remained open and in general use by the public, were held to support judgment dismissing the action. Woody v. Barnett, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 420</cite>,

                    The establishment, alteration, or discontinuance of any cartway, church road, mill road, or like easement, for the benefit of any person, firm, association, or corporation, over the lands of another, shall be determined by a special proceeding instituted

                        "Way of Necessity" and "Cartway" Distinguished. - Material differences between a way of necessity under the general law and a cartway condemned in accordance with this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a04s136-69" target="_self">G.S. 136-69</a></cite>                        include the following: If entitled to a "way of necessity" under the general law, a person is entitled thereto to as a matter of right. No payment of compensation therefor is required. On the other hand, the "peculiar way of necessity"
                        is obtained by condemnation and payment of compensation for a specific cartway in those instances where petitioner has no reasonable access to a public road as a matter of legal right or by permission. Pritchard v. Scott,
                        <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 277</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 890 (1961).

                        Establishment of a cartway is a special proceeding under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a04s136-68" target="_self">G.S. 136-68</a></cite>, and under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sXIIa33s1-393" target="_blank">G.S. 1-393</a></cite>,
                        the Rules of Civil Procedure are applicable to special proceedings; thus, summary judgment is available in a trial de novo in the superior court of a proceeding under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a04s136-68" target="_self">G.S. 136-68</a></cite>.
                        Petitioners were properly granted partial summary judgment on the issue of whether they were entitled to a cartway to access their land for timber, but a jury verdict was required to determine the placement of the cartway and the
                        damages to be awarded respondent, over whose land the cartway would be built. Greene v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 592 S.E.2d 589 (2004).

                    <p>
                        A petitioner is not entitled to condemn a cartway if he presently has access to a public road. The fact that such permission may be temporary in nature, and may be withdrawn at some future time, is not relevant. Turlington v. McLeod,
                        <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 339 S.E.2d 44 (1986).

                    <p>
                        A petition for a cartway will be denied if the petitioner has other reasonable access through a permissive right of way. Turlington v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 339 S.E.2d 44 (1986).

                        Filing Exceptions to Commissioner's Report Is Prerequisite to Appeal. - Filing exceptions to a commissioner's report that establishes a statutory cartway and determines the compensation to be paid to the affected property owners is a prerequisite to appeal.
                        Hancock v. Tenery, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 505 S.E.2d 315 (1998).

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction of Clerk. - The legislature has vested in the clerks of the superior courts of the State jurisdiction over proceedings relating to the establishment, maintenance, alteration, discontinuance, or abandonment of neighborhood public roads, church
                        roads, and cartways. Proceedings under this Article ordinarily involve questions of fact rather than issues of fact. An expeditious method of entertaining and disposing of such proceedings, without unnecessarily cluttering the
                        civil issue docket of the superior court, was desired. To this end jurisdiction was vested in the clerk. Woody v. Barnett, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 73</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 810 (1952).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Clerk's Jurisdiction Does Not Extend to Establishing Alley Within Incorporated Town. - The law relating to cartways was not intended to withdraw from cities and towns any part of their exclusive control over their streets and other public ways and confers
                        no jurisdiction on the clerk of the superior court to establish an alley within an incorporated town. Parsons v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 520</cite>, 27 S.E.2d 534 (1943).

                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction of Board of County Commissioners Under Local Law. - Under Pub. Loc. Laws 1923, c. 119, s. 12, a proceeding in Haywood County to establish cartways over the lands of others should have been instituted before the board of county commissioners,
                        and not before the clerk, and the clerk of the superior court of that county had no jurisdiction of a proceeding for this relief instituted before him. Rogers v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 35</cite>,
                        192 S.E. 872 (1937).

                        An action to obtain a judicial declaration of plaintiff's right to an easement appurtenant and by necessity over the lands of defendants is authorized by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a></cite>,
                        Article 26, and the superior court has jurisdiction, it not being a special proceeding to establish a cartway, which must be instituted before the clerk. Carver v. Leatherwood, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 96</cite>, 52 S.E.2d
                        1 (1949).

                    <p>
                        Directed Verdict and Judgment Not Withstanding Verdict Unwarranted. - Because: (1) the Court of Appeals of North Carolina declined to add a fourth element to the landowners' burden of proof in the first part of the cartway proceeding; (2) the jury instruction
                        on the element of the landowners' claim to establish the right to a cartway, requiring them to show that their land was being used for one of the purposes enumerated in the statute, conformed with the pattern jury instructions
                        without the addition of the language suggested by the adjoining landowners and fairly and accurately stated the landowners' element of proof as to the use of their property; and (3) the instruction requested by the adjoining landowners
                        gave undue emphasis to their claim the landowners' intended to use the land for future residential development, which, while not enumerated under the statute, did not defeat the landowners' right to a cartway, the trial court's
                        orders denying both a directed verdict and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict were upheld on appeal. Jones v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 660 S.E.2d 118 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Dismissal by Clerk Is Final Order. - The order of the clerk of superior court that petitioners' action be dismissed was certainly a "final order" within the meaning of this section. Taylor v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite>                        386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Order of Clerk May Be Appealed. - An order of a clerk or superior court adjudging the right to a cartway is a final judgment and an appeal lies therefrom. Candler v. Sluder, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 62</cite>, 130 S.E.2d
                        1 (1963).

                    <p>
                        When Appeal May Be Taken. - A defendant is not required to wait until a roadway is laid off before availing himself of the right to appeal, though he may, if he so elects, except to the order and defer his appeal until after the cartway has been located.
                        Candler v. Sluder, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 62</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 1 (1963).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the only issue to be tried has been determined adversely to the petitioners by the clerk of superior court, they have a right to have that determination reviewed by the judge of superior court, without further delay. Taylor v. Askew,
                        <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An order of a clerk of superior court adjudging the right to a cartway is a final judgment and an appeal lies, but there is one limitation to the right to immediately appeal an order granting the right to a cartway. Where the jury of view has been appointed
                        and has filed a written report of its findings, a party must wait until the clerk enters an order confirming, modifying, or rejecting the jury of view's proposed location of the cartway before appealing. Greene v. Garner,
                        <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 592 S.E.2d 589 (2004).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When Appeal May Not Be Taken. - Where the Clerk of Court had not entered any order either confirming, amending or rejecting the report of the jury of view dated June 19, 1997, no "final order or judgment" had been entered pursuant to which an appeal might
                        lie under this section and the trial court should have dismissed appeal as premature. Jones v. Winckelmann, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 143, 516 S.E.2d 876 (1999).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The dismissal of the respondents' interlocutory appeal was appropriate where dismissal would not ultimately preclude respondents from addressing the issue of whether petitioners are "landowners" and, therefore have a right to relief within the context
                        of this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a04s136-69" target="_self">G.S. 136-69</a></cite>; this section gives the respondent the option of appealing any final order or judgment in a special
                        proceeding to establish a cartway to the superior court for a jury trial de novo on all issues. Onuska v. Barnwell, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 537 S.E.2d 840 (2000).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Possession and Use of Land Pending Appeal. - The provision in former G.S. 40-19, which gives the court the authority to give possession and use of land to the condemnor while pending appeal, is not applicable to proceedings to establish a cartway brought
                        under this section. Lowe v. Rhodes, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 111, 175 S.E.2d 721 (1970).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Superior Court Acquires Full Jurisdiction of Appeal from Clerk's Order. - Upon the docketing of an appeal of a clerk's final order on the civil issue docket the superior court acquires full jurisdiction thereof. Taylor v. Askew,
                        <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Bringing in Additional Parties. - If the judge feels that additional parties respondent are necessary before a determination of the appeal, he should enter such orders as necessary to bring them in, but it is not proper to remand the matter to the clerk
                        of superior court without first passing upon the merits of petitioners' appeal. Taylor v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon appeal from the clerk, the trial in superior court is de novo. Candler v. Sluder, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 62</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 1 (1963).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a case involving a cartway is appealed from the clerk to the superior court, trial in superior court is de novo. Lowe v. Rhodes, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 111, 175 S.E.2d 721 (1970).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        It is the duty of the court to determine the issues of fact and questions of law involved. Taylor v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The issue to be tried in superior court is the same as before the clerk - whether petitioners are entitled to a cartway over some lands. It involves only the elements set out in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a04s136-69" target="_self">G.S. 136-69</a></cite>.
                        Candler v. Sluder, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 62</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 1 (1963); Lowe v. Rhodes, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 111, 175 S.E.2d 721 (1970).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The issue to be tried in superior court is the same as before the clerk. It does not involve the actual location of the road, or, as between defendants, whose lands shall be burdened thereby. These matters are for the jury of view, and it is error for
                        the court to undertake to dispose of them. Candler v. Sluder, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 62</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 1 (1963).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the issue to be determined by the judge on appeal is whether petitioners are entitled to a cartway over some lands, it does not involve the actual location of the road or whose land shall be burdened thereby, these being questions to be initially determined
                        by the jury of view. Taylor v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Procedure Where Petitioners Are Entitled to Cartway. - If the judge determines that the petitioners are entitled to a cartway, he should so order and remand the matter to the clerk of superior court for the appointment of a jury of view and for further
                        proceedings as prescribed by this section. Taylor v. Askew, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).

                    <p>
                        Procedure Where Petitioners Are Not Entitled to Cartway. - If the clerk of superior court's ruling that the petitioners are not entitled to a cartway is upheld by the judge of superior court, the proceeding should be dismissed. Taylor v. Askew,
                        <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 181 S.E.2d 192 (1971).

                        Where it does not appear that a road is a neighborhood public road there is no necessity for any action or proceeding under this section to discontinue its use. Walton v. Meir, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 188

                        Three elements must be satisfied before a cartway will be granted: (1) the land in question is used for one of the purposes enumerated in the statute; (2) the land is without adequate access to a public road or other adequate means of transportation affording
                        necessary and proper ingress and egress; and (3) the granting of a private way over the lands of other persons is necessary, reasonable and just. Greene v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite>                        142, 592 S.E.2d 589 (2004).

                        Directed Verdict and Judgment Not Withstanding Verdict Unwarranted. - Because: (1) the Court of Appeals of North Carolina declined to add a fourth element to the landowners' burden of proof in the first part of the cartway proceeding; (2) the jury instruction
                        on the element of the landowners' claim to establish the right to a cartway, requiring them to show that their land was being used for one of the purposes enumerated in the statute, conformed with the pattern jury instructions
                        without the addition of the language suggested by the adjoining landowners and fairly and accurately stated the landowners' element of proof as to the use of their property; and (3) the instruction requested by the adjoining landowners
                        gave undue emphasis to their claim the landowners' intended to use the land for future residential development, which, while not enumerated under the statute, did not defeat the landowners' right to a cartway, the trial court's
                        orders denying both a directed verdict and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict were upheld on appeal. Jones v. Robbins, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 660 S.E.2d 118 (2008).

                        The dismissal of the respondents' interlocutory appeal was appropriate where dismissal would not ultimately preclude respondents from addressing the issue of whether petitioners are "landowners" and, therefore have a right to relief within the context

                        A "controlled-access facility," as defined in this section, is a limited access highway where the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) acquires the legal right to cut off entirely the abutting owner's right of direct access to and

                        Action of creating a closed access road is not required to have a compensable taking, and re-routing a road could result in a compensable taking; the main issue is not what action the State took but whether that action eliminated all direct access to
                        the abutting road, as previously discussed. DOT v. BB&amp;R, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 775 S.E.2d 8 (2015).

                        An access road from old U.S. 29 to the property of a third party did not meet the statutory definition of a "frontage road" as that term is used in this Article, where the disputed access road, located as it was in an area remote from and not connecting
                        to or entering at any point on U.S. 29, did not serve to facilitate access by the public or by the third party to U.S. 29, was not necessary to provide access because all other access had been denied, and was intended to serve
                        a private and not public purpose. Pelham Realty Corp. v. Board of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 106, 272 S.E.2d 777 (1980), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 424</cite>,

                        When Remedy for Denial of Access to Highway May Be Asserted. - While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners' access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility
                        or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter's right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat
                        by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.

                    abutting lands, except at such designated points at which access may be permitted, upon such terms and conditions as may be specified from time to time by the Department of Transportation.

                        Department May Forbid Construction and Use of Driveway. - There can be no doubt of the authority of the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), upon its finding that the construction and use of a driveway, affording direct access
                        from adjoining property onto a controlled-access highway, would be or is an obstruction to the free flow of traffic thereon, or a hazard to the safety of travelers upon the highway, to forbid the construction of the driveway or
                        to prohibit its further use. Kenco Petro. Marketers, Inc. v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 411</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 508 (1967).

                        When Remedy for Denial of Access to Highway May Be Asserted. - While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners' access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility
                        or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter's right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat
                        by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.

       § 136-89.52. Acquisition of property and property rights.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    For the purposes of this Article, the Department of Transportation may acquire private or public property and property rights for controlled-access facilities and service or frontage roads, including rights of access, air, view and light, by gift, devise,
                    purchase, or condemnation in the same manner as now or hereafter authorized by law to acquire such property or property rights in connection with highways. The property rights acquired under the provisions of this Article may be in
                    fee simple or an appropriate easement for right-of-way in perpetuity. In connection with the acquisition of property or property rights for any controlled-access facility or portion thereof, or frontage road in connection therewith,
                    the Department of Transportation may, in its discretion, with the consent of the landowner, acquire an entire lot, parcel, or tract of land, if by so doing, the interests of the public will be best served, even though said entire lot,
                    parcel, or tract is not immediately needed for the right-of-way proper.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Along new controlled-access highway locations, abutting property owners shall not be entitled to access to such new locations, and no abutter's easement of access to such new locations shall attach to said property. Where part of a tract of land is taken
                    or acquired for the construction of a controlled-access facility on a new location, the nature of the facility constructed on the part taken, including the fact that there shall be no direct access thereto, shall be considered in determining
                    the fair market value of the remaining property immediately after the taking.

                        First Sentence of Section Does Not Create Right of View in Landowner. - The first sentence of this section is a grant of authority to the Department of Transportation to acquire an easement over or title to property not actually needed for roadbed, but
                        needed to prevent blind intersections of highways or other hazardous situations. This sentence of the statute does not create a right of view or sight distance in individual landowners to and from their land nor does it suggest
                        that an individual landowner has a right of view or sight distance for which compensation must be paid. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. English, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 200 S.E.2d

                        Department Is Vested with Broad Discretion. - It is well-settled law in this State that the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) is vested by statute with broad discretionary authority in the performance of its statutory duties,
                        and the court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), and control the discretion vested in the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to acquire
                        by condemnation property sought to be acquired for "controlled-access facilities"; the exercise by it of such discretionary authority and powers is not subject to judicial review, unless its action is so clearly unreasonable as
                        to amount to oppressive and manifest abuse. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Greensboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 35</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 87 (1965).

                        is vested with power of expropriation. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Greensboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 35</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 87 (1965).

                        to the highway, the right of access as to the owner and his grantees by mesne conveyance is governed by the stipulations. Kenco Petro. Marketers, Inc. v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 411</cite>,

                        Where the agreement between the owner and the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) for a taking of a part of land stipulated that the owner should have no right of access to the highway except at a designated survey station, the
                        agreement, in order to have any meaning, must perforce contemplate direct access by the owner to the highway or to a ramp at or near the designated survey station, and the denial by the Commission (now Department) of such direct
                        access constituted a taking, either of an easement appurtenant or of a right conferred by the agreement, entitling the owner or those claiming under him to compensation. Kenco Petro. Marketers, Inc. v. State Hwy. Comm'n,

                        Owner of land abutting highway has a right beyond that which is enjoyed by the general public, a special right of easement in the public road for access purposes, and this is a property right which cannot be damaged or taken from him without due compensation.
                        McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                    <p>
                        At common law the owner of land abutting a highway, while not entitled to access at all points along the boundary between his land and the highway, has a special right of easement for access purposes, and substantial interference with this free and convenient
                        access to the highway is a "taking" of a property right for which he may recover just compensation. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is generally recognized that the owner of land abutting a highway has a right beyond that which is enjoyed by the general public, a special right of easement in the public road for access purposes, and this is a property right which cannot be damaged
                        or taken from him without due compensation. State Hwy. Comm'n v. North Carolina Realty Corp., <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 166 S.E.2d 469 (1969).

                    <p>
                        A right of access to a public highway is an easement appurtenant to the land. The State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) stands in the position of a servient owner with the right to locate an access route under the general rule that
                        where an easement is granted or reserved in general terms, which do not fix a specific location, then the owner of the servient estate has the right in the first instance to designate the specific location of such easement, subject
                        to the limitation that this right be exercised in a reasonable manner with due regard to the rights of the owner of the easement. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite>                        354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                    <p>
                        The landowner has an easement consisting of the right of reasonable access to the particular highway on which his land abuts. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right of direct access from the plaintiff's land to the highway, whether it existed prior to the agreement or was created by it, was an easement appurtenant to the plaintiff's land and was a private property right in the plaintiff, over and above
                        the plaintiff's right, as a member of the public, to use this ramp as a means of getting to the lanes of the highway. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite>                        354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Right of Access Is Subject to Condemnation. - A right of access is an easement, a property right, and as such is subject to condemnation. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354,

                    <p>
                        The fact that landowner's right of access arose out of an agreement and a deed does not prevent its being a property right. McNeill v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d 58

                        Denial of Access Equivalent to Taking. - Since an abutting landowner has rights of access, a denial thereof is the equivalent of the taking thereof. State Hwy. Comm'n v. North Carolina Realty Corp., <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite>                        215, 166 S.E.2d 469 (1969).

                        A landowner is entitled to compensation where there is a complete denial of access, even if such access did not previously exist because the road in question is a newly constructed limited-access facility. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        No Compensation When Landowner Is Provided With Freely Accessible Service Road. - A landowner is entitled to no compensation for the restriction of access where he is provided with a freely accessible service road connecting with the highway on which
                        is property formerly abutted. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        The last sentence of the second paragraph of this section, when read in conjunction with the first sentence of said paragraph, contemplates a situation where the remaining property abuts the new controlled-access highway. Where defendants are not denied
                        access to a highway or roadway which abuts their property, the trial judge need not instruct the jury in accordance with the second paragraph. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. English, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                        20, 200 S.E.2d 429 (1973).

                    <p>
                        No Compensation When Landowner Is Merely Inconvenienced. - When a road or street is closed or abandoned so as to leave the landowner's property on a cul-de-sac and increase the distance one must travel to reach points in one direction, such inconvenience
                        is not compensable. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An abutting landowner is not entitled to compensation because of circuity of travel to and from his property; such inconvenience is held to be no different in kind, but merely in degree, from that sustained by the general public, and is damnum absque
                        injuria. This principle does not extend to a situation where the closing of a road, even though private in nature, cuts off the landowner's access to any public road. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        When access has been interfered with by the State the question involved is one of "degree." If the interference is not substantial and if reasonable means of ingress and egress remains or is provided, there has been a legitimate exercise of the police
                        power. If the interference is substantial and no reasonable means of ingress and egress remains or is provided, there has been a taking of a property right under the power of eminent domain. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        Cutting Off Access over Private Way or Neighborhood Road. - To completely cut off one's access over a private way or neighborhood road to the nearest public road, without providing other reasonable access to a public road, may diminish the value of the
                        land involved to the same extent as if access was denied to a public highway abutting the premises. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        Restriction of Access to Protect Those Using Highway. - While a substantial or unreasonable interference with an abutting landowner's access constitutes the taking of a property right, the restriction of his right of entrance to reasonable and proper
                        points so as to protect others who may be using the highway does not constitute a taking. Such reasonable restriction is within the police power of the sovereign and any resulting inconvenience is damnum absque injuria. State Hwy.

                        Limiting Access to One Traffic Lane by Construction of Median Strip. - The construction of a median strip so as to limit landowner's ingress and egress to lands for southbound travel when he formerly had direct access to both the north and southbound
                        lanes has been held to be a valid traffic regulation adopted by the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) in the exercise of the police power vested in it by statutes. Injury, if any, caused thereby is not
                        compensable. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        Elimination of Hazardous Access Point. - While the State Commission (now Department of Transportation) has the power to eliminate a hazardous access point, it cannot do so without paying the landowner for his property right. McNeill v. North Carolina
                        State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 167 S.E.2d 58 (1969).

                    <p>
                        When Remedy for Denial of Access to Highway May Be Asserted. - While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners' access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility
                        or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter's right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat
                        by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.
                        Department of Transp. v. Craine, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 365 S.E.2d 694, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 479</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 221 (1988), holding that evidence of
                        right to deny access was improper in a condemnation proceeding by DOT to acquire a portion of defendants' property for a non-controlled-access highway project.

                    <p>
                        Denial of access is to be considered in determining the fair market value of land immediately after the taking, and an instruction to the effect that the denial of access should not be taken into consideration is prejudicial error. North Carolina State

                    <p>
                        This section, by implication, requires the trial court to instruct the jury on the nature of the controlled-access facility, and that this denial of access should be considered in determining the fair market value of the remaining land. The failure to
                        do so is error. Board of Transp. v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 237 S.E.2d 854, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 740</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 515 (1977), aff'd,

                        Failure to Establish Facilities over Similar Tracts. - When a controlled-access facility is created by the Department of Transportation, the fact that such a facility has been established over one tract of land, but like facilities have not been established
                        over other tracts similarly situated, must be taken into account in arriving at just compensation. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Mills Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 211 S.E.2d

                <p>
                    The Department of Transportation may designate and establish controlled-access highways as new and additional facilities or may designate and establish an existing street or highway as included within a controlled-access facility. When an existing street
                    or highway shall be designated as and included within a controlled-access facility the owners of land abutting such existing street or highway shall be entitled to compensation for the taking of or injury to their easements of access.
                    The Department of Transportation shall have authority to provide for the elimination of intersections at grade of controlled-access facilities with existing State highways and county roads, and city and town streets, by grade separation
                    or frontage road, or by closing off such roads and streets, or other public ways at the right-of-way boundary line of such controlled-access facility; and after the establishment of any controlled-access facility, no highway or street
                    which is not part of said facility shall intersect the same at grade. No street or [of] any city or town and no State highway, county road, or other public way shall be opened into or connected with any such controlled-access facility
                    without the consent and previous approval of the Department of Transportation. Such consent and approval shall be given only if the public interest shall be served thereby.

                    <p>
                        North Carolina recognizes the fundamental right to just compensation as so grounded in natural law and justice that it is part of the fundamental law of this State, and imposes upon a governmental agency taking private property for public use a correlative
                        duty to make just compensation to the owner of the property taken. This principle is considered in North Carolina as an integral part of the law of the land within the meaning of N.C. Const., Art. I,
                        <span class="s2">
    §

                        Abutting Owner Has Right in Street Beyond That of General Public. - The owner of property abutting a highway has a right in the street beyond that which is enjoyed by the general public since egress and ingress to his property is a necessity peculiar

                        If There Is Taking or Destruction of a Preexisting Property Right. - When the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), in the interest of the public safety, convenience and general welfare, without the taking or destruction of a property
                        right, regulates the right to enter upon or to proceed along a controlled-access highway, the owner of land which is thereby diminished in value, such as by the diminution in volume of traffic upon the highway in front of it, is
                        not entitled to compensation. Conversely, if such action by the Commission (now Department) is a taking or destruction of a preexisting property right, the owner of such right is entitled to compensation for its taking or destruction.
                        In the latter event, the remedy of such property owner is by a proceeding under this Chapter. Kenco Petro. Marketers, Inc. v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 411</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 508

                        When Remedy for Denial of Access to Highway May Be Asserted. - While the State has a right to cut adjacent landowners' access to highway off at any time, the State can only restrict such right of access when the highway is a controlled-access facility
                        or is being converted to a controlled-access facility. It is at that point in time that the legislature has delegated a remedy to the deprived landowner of his abutter's right of access when it is denied and specified on a plat
                        by the Department of Transportation. A non-controlled-access highway has no need for these types of remedies until the situation arises where it is necessary to effect measures for the safety of the public and in the public interest.

                        traffic, if he be afforded direct access by local traffic lanes to points designated for access to through traffic. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Nuckles, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 1</cite>, 155

                        Controlled Access Road. - Trial court did not err by concluding that the North Carolina Department of Transportation did not make a road a controlled access road because it would be improper to rely upon case law that was governed by a statute that was
                        inapplicable; the statute does not change the case law regarding compensable takings of abutters' rights of access, it simply codifies the result when the State action is converting a road to a closed access road. DOT v. BB&amp;R,

                        Action of creating a closed access road is not required to have a compensable taking, and re-routing a road could result in a compensable taking; the main issue is not what action the State took but whether that action eliminated all direct access to
                        the abutting road, as previously discussed. DOT v. BB&amp;R, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 775 S.E.2d 8 (2015).

                <p>
                    The General Assembly finds that the existing State road system is becoming increasingly congested and overburdened with traffic in many areas of the State; that the sharp surge of vehicle miles traveled is overwhelming the State's ability to build and
                    pay for adequate road improvements; and that an adequate answer to this challenge will require the State to be innovative and utilize several new approaches to transportation improvements in North Carolina.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Toll funding of highway and bridge construction is feasible in North Carolina and can contribute to addressing the critical transportation needs of the State. A toll program can speed the implementation of needed transportation improvements by funding
                    some projects with tolls.

                    disasters.

                <p>
                    "(4) The condition of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge also threatens the economic stability of the tourist economy of the region, tourism being the region's main industry, and also threatens the viability of Oregon Inlet as the region's main transportation
                    corridor for commercial and recreational fishing industries.

                <p>
                    "(6) Failure or collapse of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge will result in catastrophic harm to public health, safety, and welfare, the potential harm to and loss of lives, and loss of access to the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge, which is one of our
                    country's most important natural wildlife and wildfowl habitats.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(7) Replacement of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge is critical to protect public health, safety, and welfare, and maintain necessary transportation access for emergency management and economic purposes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(8) Replacement of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge must occur as soon as is practicable, and authorization must be given to the Department of Transportation to pursue expedited permitting, design, and construction to ensure that the replacement bridge is
                    open to the public before the existing bridge fails or collapses."

                    failed to pay a toll, processing fee, or civil penalty due to that toll agency, the unpaid toll, processing fee, or civil penalty may be enforced by the Authority placing a renewal block as if it were an unpaid toll, processing fee,

                        Requisites for Indictment and Conviction. - An indictment for obstructing a neighborhood road leading to a church, which follows the words of this section, will be sustained; still, to warrant a conviction, it is essential, in the absence of proof of
                        an actual dedication, or of a laying out by public authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a04s136-71" target="_self">G.S. 136-71</a></cite>, to show a user for 20 years, and it must have been worked
                        and kept in order by public authority. State v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 804</cite>, 32 S.E. 553 (1899).

                    <p>
                        A special verdict, rendered on a trial for obstructing a road, is also defective in that it does not find that the user of the road by the public was as of right and adversary. State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 566</cite>                        (1884).

                        Placing Nails in Highway. - Placing nails in the highway in order to puncture automobile tires is an obstruction within this section. State v. Malpass, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 349</cite>, 127 S.E. 248 (1925).

                    <p>
                        Preventing Construction of Drainage Ditch. - Where a person obstructs an overseer in cutting a ditch across his land to drain a public road, he is not guilty of obstructing justice, there being no provision of law for taking private property for this
                        purpose and the payment of just compensation therefor. State v. New, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 731</cite>, 41 S.E. 1033 (1902).

                    <p>
                        Intentionally obstructing the flow of traffic constitutes an indictable nuisance, a misdemeanor, punishable by fine, or imprisonment, or both. State v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 193</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 761 (1964).

                    <p>
                        Highway Unknowingly Obstructed. - When a mill company gratuitously maintained a ball ground on its premises for its employees, without direction or supervision, it was manifest that the relation of licensor and licensee without pecuniary compensation
                        existed between them, and it was not liable for an injury caused by obstruction of an adjoining highway by a rope intended to exclude spectators who did not pay for admission, there being no evidence that it had actual or implied
                        knowledge thereof. Brooks v. Henrietta Mills Co., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 719</cite>, 110 S.E. 96 (1921).

                    <p>
                        Obstruction of Permissive Cartway. - A way over the lands of another as an outlet to and from the lands of the one claiming it cannot be established by permissive user, but by possession adverse to the true owner; and a way of this character which has
                        not been established by the public authorities or used and kept up by the public for a sufficient length of time does not fall within the meaning of this section so as to make its obstruction punishable. State v. Norris,

                        Private Easement. - A reservation by deed to the grantor of a restricted easement across the lands conveyed, without defining or locating it, and which has not since been located, the grantor and his family going across the lands conveyed whenever they
                        choose, is sufficient proof of a public road so as to sustain an indictment under this section. State v. Haynie, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 277</cite>, 84 S.E. 385 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Private Roadway. - In a prosecution for unlawfully and willfully obstructing a public cartway, in the absence of evidence of dedication to the public, or evidence of an adverse continuous user by the prosecuting witness for the period required by law
                        to give him an easement, defendant could not be guilty where the obstruction was on the part of the road where it crossed his land. State v. Lance, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 773</cite>, 94 S.E. 721

                        Maximum Penalty Held Constitutional. - Where a defendant is convicted of obstructing a highway and of wanton injury to personal property by the same act, it is not in violation of the Constitution nor otherwise improper to sentence him to the maximum
                        penalty for each offense. State v. Malpass, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 349</cite>, 127 S.E. 248 (1925).

                    <p>
                        Public-Local Law Shortening Statute of Limitations Held Invalid. - A public-local law which shortened the period for the running of the statute of limitations to a time already expired, depriving the owner of lands of his right to stop the public user
                        of a private right-of-way thereover, and declaring the right-of-way a public one, was unconstitutional in taking the property of the owner without due process of law and in denying him the equal protection of the laws. State v.
                        Haynie, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 277</cite>, 84 S.E. 385 (1915).

                        Department Erred In Denying Driveway Permit Application. - The Driveway Permit Statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a02s136-18" target="_self">G.S. 136-18(29)</a></cite>, specifically and unambiguously provides an exclusive
                        list of how DOT may regulate driveway connections, as well as an exclusive list of improvements it may require of an applicant. Because the Driveway Permit Statute treats an owner's access to the State highway system in specific
                        terms, and because it is clear and unambiguous, courts are not permitted to engage in statutory construction and the statute authorized no requirement to make improvements away from the applicant's property, and it similarly failed
                        to empower DOT to require an applicant to obtain another property owner's approval, giving that property owner veto power over the applicant's project. DOT acted in excess of its statutory authority when it conditioned the developer's
                        driveway permit on widening a railroad crossing one-quarter of a mile away from the driveway connection and on the developer's obtaining consent from two railroad companies. High Rock Lake Partners, LLC v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 315</cite>,

                        Constitutionality. - The right of those purchasing lots in a subdivision with reference to a plat to assert easements in the streets shown by the plat is dependent upon the doctrine of equitable estoppel, and providing for the termination of their easements
                        by revocation of the dedication when they have failed to assert same within two years from the effective date of the statute affords them a reasonable time in which to assert their rights, and therefore does not deprive them thereof
                        without due process of law. Sheets v. Walsh, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 32</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 817 (1940).

                        withdrawing the street and alley from dedication. By failure to develop or use, the municipality's right to insist on the dedication is lost. Osborne v. Town of N. Wilkesboro, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 696</cite>,

                        1900, plaintiffs had a right, as against the municipality, to withdraw the street and alley from dedication in 1969 under the provisions of this section so as to defeat the right of the municipality to thereafter open the street

                        be done by the dedicator or some one or more of those claiming under him, rather than the owner of property adjacent to the dedicated land. Town of Atlantic Beach v.

                        Withdrawal of Street Accepted and Maintained by Municipality. - Where a municipality opens, improves and maintains a street dedicated to the public by the registration of a map or plat showing such street, there is an acceptance of the dedication of the
                        street by the municipality, and where the dedication of a street has become complete by the acceptance thereof by a municipality, and the street is opened and maintained by the municipality and used by the public, the right to
                        revoke the dedication is gone, except with the consent of the municipality acting in behalf of the public and the consent of those persons, firms or corporations having vested rights in the dedication. Steadman v. Town of Pinetops,

                        Where a street in a subdivision is dedicated to the purchasers of lots and to the public by the sale of lots with reference to a plat of the subdivision showing the street, and the street is actually opened and used by the public even for a part of the
                        width shown by the plat, such use precludes the owner from revoking the dedication under this section, even as to the portion of the width of the street not used and maintained by the municipality. Home Real Estate Loan &amp; Ins.

                        Rights of Purchasers of Lots Sold by Reference to Map or Plat. - Where lots are sold and conveyed by reference to a map or plat which represents a division of a tract of land into subdivisions of streets and lots, such streets become dedicated to the
                        public use, and the purchaser of a lot or lots acquires the right to have all and each of the streets kept open; and it makes no difference whether the streets be in fact opened or accepted by the governing boards of towns or cities
                        if they lie within municipal corporations. There is a dedication, and if they are not actually opened at the time of the sale they must be at all times free to be opened as occasion may require. Steadman v. Town of Pinetops,

                        Section Not Applicable Where Road Is Way of Necessity. - Where the jury found that continued use of the street was necessary to afford convenient ingress, egress and regress to the lot owned by plaintiffs, the provisions of this section that a street
                        not used within 20 years after dedication shall be deemed abandoned were not applicable. Evans v. Horne, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 581</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 612 (1946); Steadman v. Town of Pinetops,

                    <p>
                        Where land was dedicated for street and highway purposes and such street or highway is necessary to afford convenient ingress and egress to any parcel of land sold and conveyed by the dedicator of such street or highway prior to March 8, 1921, the dedication
                        may not be withdrawn under the provisions of this section. Russell v. Coggin, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 674</cite>, 62 S.E.2d 70 (1950).

                        If a street is necessary to afford convenient access to a portion of a park not conveniently reached by other public streets, or the other public streets, due to their width, the amount of traffic or some like consideration, do not provide convenient
                        access to the park, then the street may not be withdrawn from public use. Andrews v. Country Club Hills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 6, 195 S.E.2d 584 (1973).

                        When it is established that a lot in a subdivision abuts the street sought to be withdrawn, it will be conclusively presumed that the street is necessary to afford convenient ingress or egress to or from the lot, and, in the absence of consent by the
                        lot owner to the withdrawal, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a07s136-96" target="_self">G.S. 136-96</a></cite> has no application and the dedication may not be withdrawn irrespective of lapse of time or
                        whether or not the street has been opened and used. Stephens v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 556 S.E.2d 14 (2001).

                        "Continued Use of" Construed. - The words "continued use of" in the statutory exception to the application of this section have been construed to mean the continued right to use.

                        Continued Right to Use Not Contingent on Prior Use. - The continued right to use in the statutory exception to the application of this section is not contingent on some prior use but is merely a continuance of a right that existed at the time of dedication.

                        Right to Use Must Be Necessary to Afford Convenient Ingress or Egress. - The operation of the statutory exception to the application of this section is predicated upon a determination of whether the continued right to use the dedicated street "shall"
                        be necessary to afford convenient ingress or egress to any lot or parcel of land conveyed by the dedicator. Andrews v. Country Club Hills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 6, 195 S.E.2d 584

                        Question Is Whether Street Is Reasonably Necessary. - Under certain circumstances a seller-dedicator or other lot owners may abandon and close a street or a portion of a street. As to a purchaser, opposing such closing, the question is whether the street
                        is reasonably necessary for the use of his lot. Wofford v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 677</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 376, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 822, 86 S. Ct. 50, 15 L. Ed.

                    <p>
                        Owners Are Only Parties Entitled to Withdraw Streets From Dedication. - The streets in question were dedicated to the public more than 20 years prior to the institution of this action by the sale of lots in a subdivision with reference to a plat showing
                        the streets. The streets were never actually opened or used at any time, and no person asserted any public or private easement therein within two years from the passage of this Article, or at any other time. The streets in question
                        are not necessary to afford convenient ingress or egress to any other lots in the subdivision. The corporation making the dedication no longer exists. Plaintiffs, claimants under dedicator, filed and recorded a declaration withdrawing
                        said streets from the dedication. It was held that the revocation of the dedication terminated the easement of the public and of the purchasers of lots in the subdivision, and therefore plaintiffs own the fee in the said land and
                        can convey same free of the easements. Sheets v. Walsh, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 32</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 817 (1940).

                    <p>
                        Where individual owners of lands subdivide and sell same by block and lot number with reference to a plat showing streets therein, they retain the fee in the streets subject to the easement thus dedicated to the public in general and to the private owners
                        of adjacent lots in particular, and are the only parties entitled to withdraw the streets from dedication when the streets have not been used for 20 years subsequent to such dedication and are not necessary for ingress and egress
                        to any of the lots sold. Russell v. Coggin, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 674</cite>, 62 S.E.2d 70 (1950).

                    <p>
                        Where a corporation, which had dedicated streets to the public by the registration of a map showing such streets, ceases to exist, the right to revoke such dedication is vested in the owner of the land abutting the streets, and such right is not affected
                        by the fact that a receivership of the corporation is still extant. Steadman v. Town of Pinetops, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 509</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 102 (1960).

                    <p>
                        It was error to find that landowners owned an unused part of a public street because, inter alia, the dedication of that part of the street was not effectively withdrawn, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a07s136-96" target="_self">G.S. 136-96</a></cite>,
                        by the purported owner of that part of the street because (1) that part of the street was not subject to withdrawal since that part of the street was but an unopened part of a public street which was otherwise opened and used by
                        the public, and, (2) when the purported owner filed a document purporting to withdraw that part of the street from dedication, the purported owner had previously transferred that property to the landowners by quitclaim deed, so
                        the purported owner no longer had any authority to withdraw that part of the street from dedication. Town of Oriental v. Henry, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 673, 678 S.E.2d 703 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 813</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Except Where Street Was Dedicated by Corporation Which Has Become Nonexistent. - The only instance in which the adjacent owners of lots in a subdivision may be deemed to own any right, title or interest in a dedicated street, except an easement therein,
                        is where the street was dedicated by a corporation which has become nonexistent. Russell v. Coggin, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 674</cite>, 62 S.E.2d 70 (1950); Owens v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite>                        178, 162 S.E.2d 576 (1968).

                        Where predecessors in title filed a declaration of withdrawal, they lost whatever sole rights to a twenty foot strip of land they may have had and became joint owners with plaintiff. Rawls v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite>                        762, 468 S.E.2d 460 (1996).

                        Adjacent Lot Owner Lacks Standing to Withdraw Dedication. - Where the original developer of a subdivision (an individual rather than a corporation) dedicated the property in question for public use when he recorded plats of the area, only he or one claiming
                        an interest in the streets through him had standing to withdraw dedication. An adjacent lot owner lacked such standing, and the trial court properly declared his attempted withdrawal of dedication void. Town of Atlantic Beach v.
                        Tradewinds Campground, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 389 S.E.2d 276 (1990).

                    <p>
                        No Withdrawal of Dedication Where There Was Never an Acceptance. - Town's argument that a property owners' association's withdrawal of its dedication of a road under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a07s136-96" target="_self">G.S. 136-96</a></cite>                        was ineffective because the dedication had been accepted necessarily lacked merit where no such acceptance was found; moreover, public access was not required in order to ensure ingress or egress to the property owners and their
                        successors in interest. Waterway Drive Prop. Owners' Ass'n v. Town of Cedar Point, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 737 S.E.2d 126 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Effect of Withdrawal. - The prospective dedication of streets, parks, etc., in the sale of a development of lands is not binding upon a city until acceptance, and neither the city nor the general public can acquire any rights thereunder against the owner
                        of the land or purchasers from him where the offer of dedication has been withdrawn before acceptance, under the provisions of this section. Irwin v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 109</cite>,
                        136 S.E. 368 (1927); Steadman v. Town of Pinetops, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 509</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 102 (1960).

                    <p>
                        Where an easement was granted both to the public and to the owners of specified property, extinguishing the public easement due to the failure to open the easement for public use, did not extinguish the easement granted to the specified property owners.
                        Stephens v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 558 S.E.2d 889, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 353</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 430 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Where the owners asserted that the street was not part of a dedication of a public road into which the street branched, the appellate court agreed; to the extent any document may have constituted an offer or proposal for dedication of the street as part
                        of the public road, that offer or proposal was withdrawn under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a07s136-96" target="_self">G.S. 136-96</a></cite>, as the withdrawal of street dedication submitted by the
                        family members of those who dedicated the public road and who previously owned the owners' property stated that the street was a 60-foot private right-of-way. Wright v. Town of Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite>                        1, 627 S.E.2d 650 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Withdrawal in Conformity with Section Terminates Easement. - Where land impliedly dedicated has not been actually opened or used for 20 years, and no person has asserted public or private easement thereon within the period fixed by this section or at
                        any other time, and the land is not necessary for ingress, egress or regress to lots sold, effect is given by this section to the filing of a declaration of withdrawal of the land from dedication on the part of those holding under
                        the original owner, and the dedication of the land is conclusively presumed to have been abandoned, and no claim of easement public or private may thereafter be enforced. Foster v. Atwater, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 472</cite>,
                        38 S.E.2d 316 (1946).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where revocation of a dedication is made in the manner provided in this section, streets and alleys theretofore dedicated become private property and are not subject to any easement by reason of the dedication except insofar as their use may be necessary
                        to afford convenient ingress to and egress from any lot previously sold and conveyed by the dedicator. Hine v. Blumenthal, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 537</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 458 (1954).

                    <p>
                        When Dedication Becomes Irrevocable. - As long as a landowner has notice of the plat through his deed, the plat does not have to be recorded in order to effect a right of way dedication; once a right of way dedication has taken place and becomes open
                        to the public and at least part of the area is maintained, the period of use becomes immaterial and the dedication becomes irrevocable. DOT v. Haggerty, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 492
                        S.E.2d 770 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Declaration of Withdrawal Must Be Filed. - When certain streets and alleys have been dedicated to the public by the registration of a plat, it is necessary to a withdrawal of the dedication under this section, among other requirements, that the declaration
                        of such withdrawal should be recorded; and when the facts agreed in an action involving the validity of an alleged withdrawal fail to disclose whether the declaration of the withdrawal had been recorded and to show plaintiffs to
                        be claimants of title under dedicators who filed the plats, they are insufficient to enable the court to determine the question. Sheets v. Walsh, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 711</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 861 (1939).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Land may not be withdrawn from dedication until the fee owners record in the register's office a declaration withdrawing such land from the use to which it has been dedicated. Food Town Stores, Inc. v. City of Salisbury,
                        <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 21</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 123 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Admissibility of Record of Withdrawal in Evidence. - In an action for damages for trespass and to enjoin further trespass upon an easement claimed by plaintiffs by dedication, the burden is on plaintiffs to establish the property right asserted, and defendants
                        are entitled to introduce the record of withdrawal of dedication executed pursuant to this section as a release or extinguishment by estoppel of record from sources to which plaintiffs were a privy, notwithstanding the absence
                        of allegation in their answer of such withdrawal from dedication. Pritchard v. Fields, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 441</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 575 (1947).

                    <p>
                        Before an abandonment can occur under this section the dedicator, or someone claiming under him, (unless the dedicator was a corporation that has ceased to exist), must file and cause to be recorded a declaration withdrawing such strip or parcel of land.

                        Liability for Failure to Remove Obstruction After Notice. - In an action to recover for injuries sustained when the car in which plaintiffs were riding struck a limb lying on a dirt highway, it was shown that defendant was a divisional engineer of the
                        State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), that the highway in question was embraced within his division, that defendant was given notice that the limb was lying across the highway and that the accident occurred
                        some six hours after such notice. It was held that defendant's motion to nonsuit was properly allowed, since, if defendant's failure to remove the limb was a breach of an official or governmental duty involving the exercise of
                        discretion, there was neither allegation nor evidence of corruption or malice, and if such duty was a ministerial duty it was of a public nature imposed entirely for the public benefit, and there was neither allegation nor proof

                        Strict Construction. - The exercise of the power of eminent domain is in derogation of common right, and all laws conferring such power must be strictly construed.

                        In construing statutes which are claimed to authorize the exercise of the power of eminent domain, a strict rather than a liberal construction is the rule. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>,
                        167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Power of Eminent Domain Is Prerogative of Sovereign State. - The right to take private property for public use, the power of eminent domain, is one of the prerogatives of a sovereign state. The right is inherent in sovereignty; it is not conferred by
                        constitutions. Its exercise, however, is limited by the constitutional requirements of due process and payment of just compensation for property condemned. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>,
                        167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Only the legislative branch can authorize the exercise of the power of eminent domain and prescribe the manner of its use. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        The right of eminent domain must be conferred by statute, either in express words or by necessary implication. State v. Core Banks Club Properties, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right of eminent domain lies dormant in the State until the legislature, by statute, confers the power and points out the occasion, mode, conditions and agencies for its exercise. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,
                        <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Hence, the executive branch of the government cannot, without the authority of some statute, proceed to condemn property for its own uses. Once authority is given to exercise the power of eminent domain, the matter ceases to be wholly legislative. The
                        executive authorities may then decide whether the power will be invoked and to what extent, and the judiciary must decide whether the statute authorizing the taking violates any constitutional rights. State v. Core Banks Club Properties,
                        <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 328</cite>, 167 S.E.2d 385 (1969).

                        Power of Eminent Domain Expressly Granted. - The General Assembly has expressly granted to the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation), under prescribed conditions, the power of eminent domain and has set forth the procedure to be

                    <p>
                        Judge to Determine How to Proceed. - Because the chapter provides no manner or mode for conducting a quick-claim direct condemnation action during a pending inverse condemnation action, the judge before whom the inverse condemnation action is pending
                        is in the best position to determine how the matter should proceed. Chappell v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 273</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 513 (2020).

                        Evidence that property owners made renovations in bad faith and for the purpose of enhancing their damages was relevant and competent evidence for a jury to consider in the determination of the value of the property at the time of the taking. DOT v. Coleman,

                        Landowner Not Restricted to Procedures to Which City Not Restricted. - Where a city is authorized, but not required, to proceed under this Article in condemning land for public purposes, failure to dismiss a landowner's inverse condemnation action is
                        not error. A landowner is not restricted to procedures to which the city itself is not restricted. Long v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 187</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 101 (1982).

                        "Taking". - "Taking" under the power of eminent domain may be defined generally as entering upon private property for more than a momentary period and, under the warrant or color of legal authority, devoting it to a public use, or otherwise informally
                        appropriating or injuriously affecting it in such a way as substantially to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment thereof. Ledford v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 188</cite>,

                        Taking Occurred When Further Use Prevented. - A taking occurred when the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) erected a fence severing the right-of-way and preventing its further use, and not at the time plaintiffs were first inconvenienced
                        by it. Ledford v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 188</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 466 (1971).

                        Prior Pending Action Doctrine. - Nothing in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-103" target="_self">G.S. 136-103</a></cite> et seq. suggested that, once a plaintiff-property owner acted pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-111" target="_self">G.S. 136-111</a></cite>,
                        precisely because of DOT's failure to act pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-103" target="_self">G.S. 136-103</a></cite>, that DOT could derail the action by initiating an action pursuant to G.S. 136-103 while
                        the plaintiff-property owner's <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-111" target="_self">G.S. 136-111</a></cite> action was ongoing. DOT v. Stimpson, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 813 S.E.2d 634 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Prior pending action doctrine applied to DOT's direct condemnation action where the property owner had brought an inverse condemnation action, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-114" target="_self">G.S. 136-114</a></cite>,
                        DOT was provided an opportunity to proceed with a fee simple direct condemnation action alongside the inverse condemnation action, and DOT failed to explain any utility in its separate action. DOT v. Stimpson, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite>                        382, 813 S.E.2d 634 (2018).

                        Under this Article a single condemnation proceeding may include more than one tract of land, and the proceeding may be amended to include additional land provided that the additional land is described in the complaint and declaration of taking and in
                        the land records of the county through a memorandum of action as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-104" target="_self">G.S. 136-104</a></cite>, and further, that the deposit is increased
                        if the sum estimated for just compensation is increased. The condemnation statutes do not require that multiple tracts be contiguous in a condemnation proceeding.

                        Amendment of Deposit. - City's motion to decrease the deposit was not allowed because the action was no longer "pending" after the landowner's filing of a voluntary dismissal. City of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC,

                    <p>
                        Complaint and the deposit are two different things, and they are treated differently; the language in the statute is clear, the condemnor may amend its complaint and notice of taking and may increase the deposit, but it may not amend a deposit to decrease
                        the amount. City of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 818 S.E.2d 116 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 325</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 870, 2020 N.C.

                        Amendment of Declaration to Properly Describe Lands. - When the condemnor has made an appraisal of lands taken but the lands described in the condemnation proceedings do not conform to the lands appraised, the condemnor may amend the proceeding to properly
                        describe the lands upon which the appraisal was made. Board of Transp. v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 251 S.E.2d 921 (1979).

                        Inability to Agree on Price of Lands Need Not Be Alleged. - It is not necessary in order for the court to obtain jurisdiction in a condemnation proceeding instituted by the Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) pursuant to this Chapter
                        that the Commission (now Department) allege in its complaint that the Commission (now Department) and the owners are unable to agree as to the price of the lands sought to be condemned. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Matthis,

                        Good Faith Attempts to Acquire Property by Negotiation. - Since the effective date of this section an allegation of prior good faith attempts to acquire the property by negotiation is not required in a condemnation complaint filed by the State Highway
                        Commission (now Department of Transportation) in order to show jurisdiction, but that absent such an allegation a complaint otherwise containing the express allegations required by this section would allege a defective statement
                        of a good cause of action. City of Charlotte v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 163 S.E.2d 289 (1968).

                        when there are no comparable sales data and the income upon which the opinion of value is based is directly attributable to the land. DOT v. Fleming, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 580, 436 S.E.2d 407 (1993).

                        Interlocutory Appeal. - Court of appeals addressed the issues in a landowner's appeal because the landowner had a substantial right to accept the deposit of just compensation a city made and to avoid a jury trial to determine just compensation, and that
                        right would be lost unless it considered the appeal; the city did not have the right to amend the complaint to reduce the deposit, and the trial court's order granting the amendment had the effect of taking away the landowner's
                        right to accept the original deposit. City of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 818 S.E.2d 116 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 325</cite>,

                        condemnation both the fee simple determinable estate and the possibility of reverter. These were taken simultaneously, and there was no interval following the taking of the fee simple determinable estate, for use for a purpose
                        other than that stated in the deed, in which the reverter could have occurred. Thus, the condemnation destroyed the possibility of reverter. City of Charlotte v. Charlotte Park &amp; Recreation Comm'n,

                        Taking Rendered Partition Suit Moot. - Taking which was proper under this section rendered earlier suit for partition of property moot; State did not have to wait until partition proceedings had been completed to condemn petitioner's interest. Coastland

                        in the same position as if it had never filed an answer and instead accepted the deposit as just compensation for the taking, and once the just compensation determination ended with the dismissal, the trial court had to enter final

                        Interlocutory Appeal. - Court of appeals addressed the issues in a landowner's appeal because the landowner had a substantial right to accept the deposit of just compensation a city made and to avoid a jury trial to determine just compensation, and that
                        right would be lost unless it considered the appeal; the city did not have the right to amend the complaint to reduce the deposit, and the trial court's order granting the amendment had the effect of taking away the landowner's
                        right to accept the original deposit. City of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 818 S.E.2d 116 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 325</cite>,

                        The word "only" in the first sentence of this section modifies "complaint," not "praying for a determination of just compensation." That is, the defendants were authorized by the statutory procedure, established by the State, to file an answer denying
                        that the proposed condemnation is for a public use, and were authorized to do so at any time within 12 months after the summons and complaint were served upon them. If this procedure puts the State Highway Commission (now Department
                        of Transportation) at a disadvantage in constructing highways to meet the public need the remedy is in the legislature, not the courts. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Thornton, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 227</cite>,

                        Trial court had no authority to rule on a city's motion to amend its complaint after a landowner filed its voluntary dismissal because the dismissal ended the only pending claim, just compensation; the dismissal put the landowner in the same position
                        as if it had never filed an answer and instead accepted the deposit as just compensation for the taking, and once the just compensation determination ended with the dismissal, the trial court had to enter final judgment in the
                        amount deposited. City of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 818 S.E.2d 116 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 325</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 870, 2020

                        If a voluntary dismissal has the effect of making the case as though a suit was never filed, then under the statute the dismissal must be treated as an admission by the defendant that the amount deposited is just compensation for the taking. City of Charlotte

                        Interlocutory Appeal. - Court of appeals addressed the issues in a landowner's appeal because the landowner had a substantial right to accept the deposit of just compensation a city made and to avoid a jury trial to determine just compensation, and that
                        right would be lost unless it considered the appeal; the city did not have the right to amend the complaint to reduce the deposit, and the trial court's order granting the amendment had the effect of taking away the landowner's

                        Recording Not Required for Interests in Land Acquired Prior to July 1, 1959. - Section 47-27, which governs deeds for rights-of-way and easements, provides that the Department of Transportation (DOT) does not have to record such interests in land which
                        were acquired prior to July 1, 1959. DOT v. Wolfe, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 449 S.E.2d 11 (1994).

                        One of the purposes of this section was to eliminate from the jury trial any question as to what land the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) is condemning and any question as to its title. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Nuckles,

                        Section Does Not Infringe Right to Trial by Jury. - This section is constitutional and does not deprive the plaintiffs of their right to trial by jury as the same is guaranteed by the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. Kaperonis v. North

                        When the taking by the sovereign is conceded, questions preliminary to the determination of the amount to be paid are questions of fact to be determined by the court - not issues of fact which must be determined by a jury. This is the basis for the conclusion
                        reached in Kaperonis v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 587</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 464 (1963), holding this section constitutional. Wescott v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 522</cite>,

                        Time Limitations. - Trial court properly entered judgment awarding a property owner no further damages than the amount of a condemnor's deposit because any error by the trial court in dismissing the motion for a hearing was not prejudicial inasmuch as
                        the owner filed its motion less than 10 before trial was to begin, the owner was not deprived of its right to pursue its inverse condemnation claims in a separate action, the owner made no argument concerning how either order affected
                        a substantial right such that the trial court was divested of jurisdiction to proceed to trial and enter further orders, and the owner's motion for a continuance was not filed until the week before the scheduled trial date. DOT

                        The trial judge in a proceeding against the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) held under this section could consider evidence of damages for the limited purpose of finding that the plaintiffs had made a prima facie showing of

                        Assessment of Damages to Tracts Other Than Those Taken. - Obviously, it would be an exercise in futility, completely thwarting the purpose of this section to have the jury assess damages to four certain tracts if plaintiff were condemning only two other
                        tracts, and the verdict would be set aside on appeal for errors committed by the judge in determining the issues other than damages. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Nuckles, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 1</cite>,

                        Although the parties to a condemnation hearing must resolve all issues other than damages at the hearing under this section, the section does not require the parties to appeal those issues before proceeding to the damages trial. Therefore, defendants
                        were not required to immediately appeal trial court's order unifying four remaining tracts. DOT v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 172</cite>, 521 S.E.2d 707 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Since an appeal specifically contested the trial court's determination of the area affected by the taking, which was a "vital preliminary issue," the case was properly before the appellate court to review the trial court's determination that tracts of
                        land were not united for condemnation purposes. DOT v. Airlie Park, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 576 S.E.2d 341, appeal dismissed sub nom., DOT v. Airlie, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 504</cite>,

                        Trial court correctly denied a property owner's motion for a second hearing, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite>, because the court's first order following a hearing
                        in the condemnation action concerned issues of title and area taken; therefore, the correct mechanism for review of the first order was an appeal within thirty days of judgment pursuant to N.C. R. App. P. 3(c)(1). When the owner
                        failed to appeal from the first order within thirty days of entry, it lost that right. City of Wilson v. Batten Family, L.L.C., <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 740 S.E.2d 487 (2013).

                        Court of appeals reviewed a property owner's appeal of an order concluding that the closure of a road was not a compensable taking because the interlocutory order affected the owner's substantial rights; the issue of whether the loss of access to the
                        road constituted a taking of the owner's appurtenant easement affected a substantial right because the question of what area was taken was a vital preliminary issue that had to be determined before proceeding to a trial on proper
                        compensation. DOT v. BB&amp;R, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 775 S.E.2d 8 (2015).

                        North Carolina Department of Transportation's (NCDOT) appeal of an interlocutory procedural order in an inverse condemnation action was dismissed because NCDOT showed no deprivation of a substantial right, as NCDOT had no such right unless and until NCDOT
                        filed a map or plat identifying the property to be condemned. Beroth Oil Co. v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 808 S.E.2d 488 (2017).

                        Voluntary Dismissal. - Trial court had no authority to rule on a city's motion to amend its complaint after a landowner filed its voluntary dismissal because the dismissal ended the only pending claim, just compensation; the dismissal put the landowner
                        in the same position as if it had never filed an answer and instead accepted the deposit as just compensation for the taking, and once the just compensation determination ended with the dismissal, the trial court had to enter final
                        judgment in the amount deposited. City of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 818 S.E.2d 116 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 325</cite>, 837

                        Review on Appeal of Arbitrary and Capricious Conduct. - If condemnation proceedings are subject to review due to allegations of arbitrary and capricious conduct or abuse of discretion, and if the court finds safety to be of legitimate concern, the trial
                        judge must make a finding of fact on that issue. Absent such a ruling, an appellate court cannot properly review the trial court's decision as to whether or not Department of Transportation's actions were arbitrary and capricious.

                        Appeal Held Interlocutory - Landowners' appeal of the rejection of their argument in their condemnation case that they were entitled to have business damages included in any just compensation award made to them had to be dismissed as the statute expressly
                        permitted the trial court to decide any and all issues raised by the pleadings except the issue of damages, which were to be determined later in a jury trial; thus, because not all issues were resolved in the condemnation proceeding,
                        the appeal from the trial court's denial of their argument concerning damages was interlocutory and that part of the appeal had to be dismissed. DOT v. Byerly, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite>                        454, 573 S.E.2d 522 (2002).

                    <p>
                        Order concluding that the closure of a road was not a compensable taking was interlocutory because the order was not a final judgment in the proceeding; the jury still had to determine the amount of compensation a property owner was entitled to for the
                        taking of its property by the North Carolina Department of Transportation. DOT v. BB&amp;R, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 775 S.E.2d 8 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Court of appeals addressed the issues in a landowner's appeal because the landowner had a substantial right to accept the deposit of just compensation a city made and to avoid a jury trial to determine just compensation, and that right would be lost unless
                        it considered the appeal; the city did not have the right to amend the complaint to reduce the deposit, and the trial court's order granting the amendment had the effect of taking away the landowner's right to accept the original
                        deposit. City of Charlotte v. Univ. Fin. Props., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 135, 818 S.E.2d 116 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 325</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 870, 2020 N.C. LEXIS

                        Appeal Timely. - In a case involving an inverse condemnation claim pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite>, property owners' notice of appeal was timely because: (1) it was
                        filed within 30 days after the trial court's order dismissing the inverse condemnation claim became final as required by N.C. R. App. P. 3(c)(1) where the dismissal of the inverse condemnation claim was interlocutory until a contract
                        claim was voluntarily dismissed, and (2) the property owners were not required to immediately appeal the trial court's ruling that the North Carolina Department of Transportation's failure to build a driveway at a 10 percent grade
                        was not a taking where that ruling did not address a question of title or area taken. DeHart v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 417, 672 S.E.2d 721 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Because a <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite> hearing did not finally resolve all issues, and because the department of transportation (DOT) failed to identify what right was at
                        issue or why any substantial right would be jeopardized without immediate review of the trial court's order, its appeal of a finding of inverse condemnation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-111" target="_self">G.S. 136-111</a></cite>                        was dismissed as interlocutory under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 54(a).

                        Appeal Untimely. - Because the time for filing a notice of appeal in a condemnation action was not tolled, plaintiff town's appeal from a "section 108" hearing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite>                        was untimely.

                        Failure to Invoke Section. - Where landowners failed to avail themselves of the mechanism for determining issues other than damages provided in this section and, instead, specifically stipulated that only the matter of just compensation remained for resolution
                        at trial, the landowners could not dispute the amount of property affected by the plaintiffs' taking nor the plaintiffs' listing thereof in the Declaration of Taking before the appellate court. North Carolina DOT v. Tilley,

                        Action Held Not a Taking. - In a case involving an inverse condemnation claim pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite>, a trial court did not err in concluding that there
                        was no taking of the property owners' property because the property owners failed to prove that the increased slope of their new driveway substantially deprived them of the use of their land.

                        DOT's grant of a driveway permit application off of a private road taken by the DOT was a function of the DOT's police power as a State agency, not a compensable taking; therefore, evidence regarding the driveway permit and its resulting increase in traffic
                        was excluded from the private road owner's damages trial; this issue was properly determined in a hearing under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite>. DOT v.

                        of an old causeway which is plaintiffs' only means of vehicular ingress to and egress from their property, plaintiffs may resort to their legal remedy under this section to recover just compensation for the taking of their property
                        rights. Frink v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 218 S.E.2d 713 (1975).

                        Plea of Statute of Limitations Is Complete Defense. - Where the plaintiff - notwithstanding he had actual knowledge that the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) had appropriated his property - did not bring this action for compensation
                        within the time fixed by this section for its commencement, defendant's plea of the statute is a complete defense to the action. Wilcox v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 185</cite>,

                        Construction With Other Statutes. - Decision and order of the North Carolina Industrial Commission was affirmed because the North Carolina Tort Claims Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html#t143a31s143-291" target="_blank">G.S. 143-291</a></cite>                        et seq., governed the property owners' negligence claim against a state agency, rather than <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-111" target="_self">G.S. 136-111</a></cite>. The statute addressed actions seeking damages for
                        condemnation, while the North Carolina Tort Claims Act governed negligence claims. Pate v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 626 S.E.2d 661, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 535</cite>, 633 S.E.2d

                        Certification of Class Action in Inverse Condemnation. - It was not error to deny landowners' motion to certify a class as to an inverse condemnation claim against the North Carolina Department of Transportation because, inter alia, the extent of each
                        landowner's alleged damages was not a collateral issue. Beroth Oil Co. v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 333</cite>, 757 S.E.2d 466 (2014).

                        It was not error to deny landowners' motion to certify a class as to an inverse condemnation claim against the North Carolina Department of Transportation because, inter alia, liability could be established only after examining the circumstances of each
                        property, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-112" target="_self">G.S. 136-112</a></cite>. Beroth Oil Co. v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 333</cite>, 757 S.E.2d 466 (2014).

                        It was not error to deny landowners' motion to certify a class as to an inverse condemnation claim against the North Carolina Department of Transportation because, inter alia, the unique nature of property and the large number of diverse tracts caused
                        individual issues to predominate over common issues of law and fact, as the proposed class included over 800 landowners with different property interests, not all of whom were affected in the same way. Beroth Oil Co. v. N.C. DOT,
                        <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 333</cite>, 757 S.E.2d 466 (2014).

                        When a trial court denied landowners' motion to certify a class as to an inverse condemnation claim against the North Carolina Department of Transportation, it was error to analyze the substantive merits of the claim because the relevant issue was whether
                        the landowners met the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 23. Beroth Oil Co. v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 333</cite>,

                        Limitation on Action Involving Airport Runway. - Where plaintiffs' action, involving a taking incident to the construction of an airport runway, accrued in June, 1979, and over two years later, in July, 1981, new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.040A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 40A</a></cite>                        was enacted, the period between such enactment and the cutoff date under the new limitation, five months and three weeks (July 10, 1981 to January 1, 1982), was not itself so unreasonably short as to deny plaintiffs due process
                        of law, particularly in light of the fact that plaintiffs lived in an area where large numbers of inverse condemnation actions were filed within the statutory period. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite>                        517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).

                        "Taking". - "Taking" under the power of eminent domain may be defined generally as entering upon private property for more than a momentary period and, under the warrant or color of legal authority, devoting it to a public use, or otherwise informally
                        appropriating or injuriously affecting it in such a way as substantially to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment thereof. Ledford v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 188</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Although plaintiffs' property damage caused by the bridge construction does not fit squarely within the definition of a "taking," North Carolina courts have consistently held that such damage does, in fact, constitute a "taking." Robinson v. North Carolina
                        DOT, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 366 S.E.2d 492 (1988).

                    <p>
                        When the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) filed transportation corridor maps, under the Transportation Corridor Official Map Act (Map Act), <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a2Es136-44.50" target="_self">G.S. 136-44.50</a></cite>                        to 136-44.54, it was error to dismiss property owners' inverse condemnation claims as not being ripe because filing the maps exercised eminent domain, giving the owners' takings claims a basis, as restrictions on the owners' properties
                        substantially interfered with the owners' ownership rights, as (1) the restrictions did not uniformly "sunset" after the filing, but NCDOT could exercise eminent domain any time after the filing, and (2) the restrictions could
                        "bind" the properties for at least 60 years. Kirby v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 345, 769 S.E.2d 218, dismissed and review granted, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 279</cite>, 775 S.E.2d 829, 2015 N.C.

                        Taking Occurred When Further Use Prevented. - The taking occurred when the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) erected the fence, severing the right-of-way and preventing its further use, and not at the time plaintiffs were first
                        inconvenienced by it. Ledford v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 188</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 466 (1971).

                        Inverse Condemnation upon a Further Taking. - Property owners need not seek to recover compensation in ongoing condemnation proceedings for a subsequent further taking by the State. Property owners may choose to bring a separate action for inverse condemnation
                        pursuant to this section when there is a further taking by the State after the initiation of the original condemnation action. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 603</cite>,
                        304 S.E.2d 164 (1983).

                    <p>
                        When choosing to bring a separate action for inverse condemnation, the property owners will not be entitled to damages which are merely a consequence of the taking in the prior condemnation action. Injuries accruing to the remaining property caused by
                        the original taking by condemnation, including injuries resulting from the condemnor's use of the previously taken portion, are not compensable in an inverse condemnation action unless they are so great as to amount in themselves
                        to a separate taking. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 603</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 164 (1983).

                        Assertion of Inverse Condemnation Claim During Ongoing Proceedings Was Proper. - Property owners were permitted to assert an inverse condemnation claim for a further taking during the ongoing proceedings. Therefore, their assertion of a claim against
                        the Department of Transportation for inverse condemnation of the .832-acre parcel as a counterclaim within the original condemnation action was proper. N.C. DOT v.

                        Counterclaim For Inverse Condemnation Not Filed In Accordance With Statute. - Property owners' counterclaim for inverse condemnation was not filed in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-111" target="_self">G.S. 136-111</a></cite>,
                        as the owners failed to allege a claim under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-111" target="_self">G.S. 136-111</a></cite> or to file a memorandum of action.

                        Prior Pending Action Doctrine. - Prior pending action doctrine applied to DOT's direct condemnation action where the property owner had brought an inverse condemnation action, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-114" target="_self">G.S. 136-114</a></cite>,
                        DOT was provided an opportunity to proceed with a fee simple direct condemnation action alongside the inverse condemnation action, and DOT failed to explain any utility in its separate action.

                        precisely because of DOT's failure to act pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-103" target="_self">G.S. 136-103</a></cite>, that DOT could derail the action by initiating an action pursuant to G.S. 136-103 while

                        Effect of Conveyance of Land After Institution of Action. - The trial court did not err in denying appellants' motion to intervene in an inverse condemnation action, where part of the land in question had been conveyed to the appellants by the plaintiffs
                        in the condemnation action after the institution of the action, since a "taking" is envisioned as already having occurred if the property owner institutes the proceeding under this section. Berta v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n,

                        Damage to land which inevitably or necessarily flows from a public construction project results in an appropriation of land for public use. The remedy for such property damage is an action against the Department of Transportation on the theory of condemnation.

                        A contractor employed by the Department of Transportation cannot be held liable to a property owner for damages resulting from the work done with proper skill and care. The owner's remedy is against the Department of Transportation on the theory of condemnation.

                        An agreement between the Department of Transportation and a contractor that the contractor would indemnify the Department of Transportation for any claims arising out of the performance of a highway reconstruction contract, including any claims caused
                        by the contractor's blasting operations, did not affect plaintiff's right to sue the Department of Transportation or the contractor or both for loss of a building on their property allegedly caused by the contractor's blasting
                        operations. Cody v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">45 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 263 S.E.2d 334 (1980).

                        Additional Compensation for Delay in Payment - When Required. - When the taking of property by the State precedes the payment of compensation, the owner is entitled to additional compensation for the delay in payment. U.S. Const., Amends. V and XIV and
                        N.C. Const., Art. I,
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 19 require this additional payment as a part of just compensation. The additional sum awarded for delay in payment of the value for the property taken is not interest eo nomine, but interest is a fair means for measuring
                        the amount to be arrived at of such additional sums. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 254</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 355 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Just Compensation Determination is Judicial Function. - Since the ascertainment of just compensation is a judicial function, and compensation for delay in payment is a part of just compensation, determining the amount of additional compensation for delay
                        in payment is also a judicial function. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 254</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 355 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Compound Interest. - Compound interest should be allowed for delayed payment in condemnation cases if the evidence shows that during the pertinent period the "prudent investor" could have obtained compound interest in the market place. The use of compound
                        interest as a measure in calculating additional compensation for delay is a matter which will turn upon the evidence in each case and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 254</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 355 (1986).

                        Immediate Appeal. - North Carolina Department of Transportation's (NCDOT) appeal of an interlocutory procedural order in an inverse condemnation action was dismissed because NCDOT showed no deprivation of a substantial right, as NCDOT had no such right
                        unless and until NCDOT filed a map or plat identifying the property to be condemned. Beroth Oil Co. v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 808 S.E.2d 488 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Appeal of Finding of Inverse Condemnation Dismissed as Interlocutory. - Because a <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-108" target="_self">G.S. 136-108</a></cite> hearing did not finally resolve all issues, and because the
                        department of transportation (DOT) failed to identify what right was at issue or why any substantial right would be jeopardized without immediate review of the trial court's order, its appeal of a finding of inverse condemnation

                    <p>
                        Substantial Compliance Found. - Because the land in controversy had already been noticed by the Department of Transportation in relation to their initial condemnation action and the memorandum of action was filed a week before the hearing in question,
                        all proper parties to the lawsuit were on notice of the controversy in question; the property owners were in substantial compliance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-111" target="_self">G.S. 136-111</a></cite>.

                            Constitutionality. - The provision allowing general benefits to set off the fair market value of the remaining part of a tract of land under this section violates the constitutional requirement of providing just compensation in condemnation proceedings,
                            and the equal protection rights of property owners, because the statute allows a compensation which is unjust to the condemnee while providing a windfall to the public. The property owner is subjected to an involuntary taking
                            of his property while also being subjected to the injustice of receiving an amount less than what he actually lost. He is being required to carry the undue burden of paying an additional cost not paid by the rest of the public.

                            waters among private parties and has no application in condemnation proceedings, since the principle of reasonable use is superseded by the constitutional mandate that just compensation must be paid when private property is

                            A determination of ownership of the area affected is a prerequisite to a determination of just compensation for the area taken. Limiting the trial court's factfinding to ownership of the area taken alone would deprive the defendants of just compensation.

                            Valuation of Undeveloped Land Suitable for Subdivision. - It is proper to show in a highway condemnation proceeding that a particular tract of land is suitable and available for division into lots and is valuable for that purpose, but it is not proper
                            to show the number and value of lots as separated parcels in an imaginary subdivision thereof. In other words, it is not proper for the jury in these cases to consider an undeveloped tract of land as though a subdivision thereon
                            is an accomplished fact. Such undeveloped property may not be valued on a per lot basis. The cost factor is too speculative. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite>                            47, 173 S.E.2d 494 (1970).

                        <p>
                            The fair market value of undeveloped land immediately before condemnation is not a speculative value based on an imaginary subdivision and sales in lots to many purchasers. It is the fair market value of the land as a whole in its then state according
                            to the purpose or purposes to which it is best adapted and in accordance to its best and highest capabilities. It is not proper for a jury to consider an undeveloped tract of land as though a subdivision thereon is an accomplished
                            fact. Such undeveloped property may not be valued on a per lot basis. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Reeves, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 47, 173 S.E.2d 494 (1970).

                            A designated number of lots multiplied by a price per lot is not a proper basis for determining value of undeveloped land which is suitable for subdivision. State Hwy.

                        <p>
                            A court is correct in excluding testimony as to value of the land based on supposed subdivisions and the sale of lots at an estimated price per lot after deducting an estimated cost per lot for development. Such a method of valuation is too speculative

                            Where defendants acquired two tracts as separate tracts at different times, considered them to be separate tracts, and put them to different usages, and as of the date of taking, neither tract was necessary to defendants' use or enjoyment of the other,
                            and the trial court found that there was no connection between the two tracts such as would render defendants' enjoyment of the smaller tract necessary to their enjoyment of the larger one, the court's findings supported its
                            conclusion that there did not exist, on the date of taking, any unity of use between the two tracts, and such conclusion supported its order that the tracts be considered separately in assessing damages. North Carolina Dep't

                            Inverse Condemnation Claim Properly Dismissed After Formal Condemnation Instituted. - The trial court correctly granted the Department of Transportation's motion to dismiss the defendants' inverse condemnation claim where DOT had already instituted a
                            formal condemnation action prior to defendants' answer and the provisions of this section would guide the determination of the proper amount of just compensation for the DOT's taking from the property. DOT v. Mahaffey,

                            Right of Action Accrues When Damage Occurs. - Where there has been a taking of property by the construction and maintenance of a nuisance, the right of action does not accrue until damage has occurred. And ordinarily the applicable statute of limitations
                            begins to run against the landowner at the time the first damage arises from the nuisance. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 392, 291 S.E.2d 844

                            In General. - Where a portion of a tract of land is taken for highway purposes, the just compensation to which the landowner is entitled is the difference between the fair market value of the property as a whole immediately before and immediately after
                            the appropriation of the portion thereof. City of Charlotte v. Charlotte Park &amp; Recreation Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 26</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 601 (1971).

                        <p>
                            The measure of damages to be used in condemnation cases in which the State does not take the plaintiff's property in its entirety is mandated by this section to be the difference between the fair market value of the entire tract immediately prior to said
                            taking and the fair market value of the remainder immediately after said taking less any special or general benefits. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 603</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Subdivision (1) of this section provides that the commissioners, jury or judge are restricted to the difference between the fair market value of the entire tract immediately prior to said taking and the fair market value of the remainder immediately after
                            said taking. The judge is required to instruct the jury to use the above standard - and that standard only - in computing damages. However, a real estate appraiser is given wide latitude regarding permissible bases for opinions
                            on value. Department of Transp. v. Byrum, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 345 S.E.2d 416 (1986).

                            Subdivision (1) of this section provides a landowner compensation only for damages arising from a taking of property and which flow directly from the use to which the land taken is put. No compensation is awarded for damages which are shared by neighboring
                            property owners and the public, and which arise regardless of whether the landowner's property has been condemned. Board of Transp. v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 256, 296 S.E.2d

                            to any particular method of determining the fair market value of property. Department of Transp. v. McDarris, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 302 S.E.2d 277 (1983).

                            Items Making Up Difference in Value Before and After Taking. - Items going to make up the "difference" in subdivision (1) of this section embrace compensation for the part taken and compensation for injury to the remaining portion, which is to be offset
                            under the terms of this section by any general and special benefits resulting to the landowner from the utilization of the property taken for a highway. Templeton v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 337</cite>,

                            Distinction Between General and Special Benefits. - The most satisfactory distinction between general and special benefits is that general benefits are those which arise from the fulfillment of the public object which justified the taking, and special
                            benefits are those which arise from the peculiar relation of the land in question to the public improvement. Templeton v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 337</cite>, 118 S.E.2d

                            "Special benefits" have been defined as those which arise from the peculiar relation of the land in question to the public improvement. "General benefits" are those accruing to the public at large by reason of increased community property resulting from
                            the project. Department of Transp. v. McDarris, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 302 S.E.2d 277 (1983).

                            Damage Resulting from Condemnor's Use of Appropriated Portion Included. - In determining the fair market value of the remaining land where only a part or a tract of land is appropriated for highway purposes, the owner is entitled to damage which is a
                            consequence of the taking of the portion thereof, that is, for the injuries accruing to the residue from the taking, which includes damage resulting from the condemnor's use of the appropriated portion. Board of Transp. v.

                            Damage Must Result from Use of Particular Land Taken. - Noise or any other element of damages to the remaining lands where only a part or a tract of land is appropriated for highway purposes is compensable only if it is demonstrably resultant from the

                            As long as a landowner is afforded reasonable access to an abutting street or highway, he is not entitled to compensation. Mere inconvenience resulting from circuity of travel is not compensable. Board of Transp. v. Bryant,

                            Compensation Does Not Include Diminution of Value Resulting from Taking Lands of Others. - The rule supported by better reason and the weight of authority is that the just compensation assured by U.S. Const., Amend. V to an owner, a part of whose land
                            is taken for public use, does not include the diminution of value of the remainder, caused by the acquisition and use of adjoining lands of others for the same undertaking. Board of Transp. v. Brown,

                            Damages Not Resulting from Taking Are Not Compensable. - Damages for unreasonable interference with access to defendants' remaining property during construction on a public road project do not arise from the taking of the right-of-way or from the use
                            to which the taken property is put. These damages are noncompensable because they are not unique to defendants. They are shared by defendants in common with the public at large, and the fact that a taking occurs does not make
                            all other damages automatically compensable. Board of Transp. v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 256, 296 S.E.2d 814 (1982).

                            Traffic Noise from Proposed Highway as Element of Damage. - The exclusion of evidence of traffic noise from the controlled-access highway to be constructed on the part of the plaintiffs' land taken by the Department of Transportation, which would cause
                            a diminution in value of the remaining land, was prejudicial error. Board of Transp. v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 266, 237 S.E.2d 854, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 740</cite>,

                            rail bridge in the middle of a roadway, the owner was not entitled to compensation because the loss in visibility of the owner's property to passing traffic was not part of the taking of the owner's property to widen the roadway.

                            they derived the necessary numerical values, and the evidence of the net income from operation of a parking lot on the property was not inadmissible evidence of "lost profits" as the owners' experts performed the calculations

                            In general, purchase price is admissible if it is relevant to the value of the land at the time of condemnation. City of Winston-Salem v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 172, 296 S.E.2d 21, cert. denied,

                            Where condemnees bought the property at a voluntary sale only four years before the condemnation action and there was no evidence of extensive changes to the condemned parcel or to the surrounding area, the purchase price was admissible. City of Winston-Salem

                            The price paid at voluntary sales of land, similar in nature, location, and condition to the condemnee's land, is admissible as independent evidence of the value of the land taken if the prior sale was not too remote in time. Whether two properties are
                            sufficiently similar to admit evidence of the purchase price of one as a guide to the value of the other is a question to be determined by the trial judge in the exercise of a sound discretion guided by law. City of Winston-Salem

                            It is permissible for a witness to use a map, diagram or photograph of a place or object to illustrate his testimony and make it more intelligible to the court and jury. These aids have been particularly helpful in condemnation cases in providing the

                            to enter the service station, a new trial was ordered because the trial court erred in not excluding the quantified estimate of lost profits and any valuation based solely on that evidence. DOT v. M.M. Fowler, Inc.,

                            be considered; the trial court held that the expert's flood plain analogy was not a proper basis for determining value after a Map Act taking, and the exclusion of the expert's testimony as unreliable was not an abuse of discretion
                            because there was no reliable reason to choose flood plain property as the analogous property. Chappell v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 273</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 513 (2020).

                            evidence; preventing an appraiser witness from disclosing information regarding enhancing components was found to be at odds with the practice of real estate appraisal, and prevented an accurate reflection for the jury of the
                            fair market value of the condemned property. City of Hillsborough v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 538 S.E.2d 586 (2000).

                            The jury should be allowed to hear testimony that construction of a highway greatly increased the property values of all the property along the highway, and the opinion of a witness that petitioners' land had tripled in value in determining what general
                            and special benefits, if any, the petitioners received. Templeton v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 337</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 918 (1961).

                            Cross-Examination of Expert Witness. - An expert witness may be questioned on cross-examination with respect to the sales prices of nearby property to test his knowledge of values and for the purpose of impeachment, but not for the purpose of fixing value.
                            This is especially true if the witness used such sales as a basis for his appraisal of the property taken, or if he had actually appraised the property sold. Templeton v. State Hwy. Comm'n,

                            Owner's Testimony as to Intended Use Not Prejudicial. - Owner's testimony of his intended use for a condemned property did not prejudice a city as the parties agreed that the highest and best use for the property was as an airport parking lot and the
                            city used the property as an airport parking lot after it was condemned. City of Charlotte v. Hurlahe, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 631 S.E.2d 28 (2006).

                            Testimony Excluded As Not Related to Appropriate Valuation Methods. - There was no evidence concerning the fair market value of the property after the 1992 and 2006 takings based on a cost approach or income capitalization approach to valuation and thus
                            it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to exclude testimony that did not relate to one of the three appropriate methods of determining fair market value. Chappell v. N.C. DOT,
                            <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 273</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 513 (2020).

                            Instruction in Partial Taking Case. - If there is a jury trial on the issue of compensation in a partial taking case the trial court is required to instruct the jury only on the before and after value rule set forth in subdivision (1) of this section.

                            Jury Instructions Were Without Error. - Because the trial court's instruction to the jury was based upon law of the case and, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a09s136-112" target="_self">G.S. 136-112</a></cite>,
                            left the determination of what constituted the highest and best use of the property owner's land to the jury, the instruction in the utility's condemnation proceeding was not error. Progress Energy Carolinas, Inc. v. Strickland,

                            Jury Instructions, Taken in Their Entirety, Were Without Error. - Although the language of a jury instruction in an eminent domain case, which stated that the jury should have based its verdict on the "peculiar" value of the property rather than the difference
                            between the fair market value of the property immediately before and after the taking, would likely have been problematic in isolation, the instructions, when viewed contextually and in their entirety, were without error; in
                            light of the trial court's repeated use of the proper calculation of damages throughout its instructions, the isolated statement of the value peculiar to the church was likely not misleading, and did not warrant invalidation
                            of the award. DOT v. Marston Baptist Church, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 756, 676 S.E.2d 313 (2009).

                        <p>
                            Instruction Not Prejudicial. - While it might have been erroneous to include a jury instruction regarding the road being built, to the extent the taking was a negative easement and not similar to a fee simple taking of the property, the error was not
                            prejudicial because it could not have impacted the jury's determination of just compensation; there was no evidence of an alternative fair market valuation that could have informed the jury's verdict, and thus regardless of
                            the instruction, the evidence admitted supported the jury's verdict on fair compensation. Chappell v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 273</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 513 (2020).

                            Jury Must Strictly Adhere to Formula. - A jury was required to calculate the value of tract taken according to the strict formula set forth in this section.

                            Compensation for Actual Taxes Paid. - Where the property essentially had no fair market value once the 1992 corridor map was recorded, and there was no other evidence of the value of the property using a cost approach or an income capitalization approach,
                            the owners were effectively paying taxes on property that had no value; thus, it was appropriate for the trial court to take into account the effect of the reduced ad valorem taxes and compensate the owners for the actual taxes
                            they paid at a time when their property had virtually no fair market value. Chappell v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 273</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 513 (2020).

                        <p>
                            No Market for Property Proper Consideration. - Fact that there was evidence of no market whatsoever for the property, that no one wanted to buy a house in the outer loop corridor once the 1992 map was recorded, was a proper consideration in determining
                            the after-taking fair market value, and it was not an abuse of discretion for the trial court to allow the owners' appraiser to testify concerning the fair market value of their property after the taking because that expert
                            opinion was based on evidence that there was no market whatsoever for the property. Chappell v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 273</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 513 (2020).

                        Interest Is Separate From and Additional to Damages. - Interest is an element of recovery that is separate from and in addition to the measure of damages to be used by the jury in arriving at just compensation. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        Formerly It Was Jury's Function to Award Interest. - Prior to the enactment of this section it was the jury's function to award interest as just compensation for a delay in the payment for the property taken and it was necessary for the court to charge
                        as to that duty. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 170 S.E.2d 159 (1969).

                        Additional Compensation for Delay in Payment - When Required. - When the taking of property by the State precedes the payment of compensation, the owner is entitled to additional compensation for the delay in payment. U.S. Const., Amends. V and XIV and
                        N.C. Const., Art. I,

    §
   </span> 19 require this additional payment as a part of just compensation. The additional sum awarded for delay in payment of the value for the property taken is not interest eo nomine, but interest is a fair means for measuring
                        the amount to be arrived at of such additional sums. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 254</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 355 (1986).

                        Just Compensation Determination is Judicial Function. - Since the ascertainment of just compensation is a judicial function, and compensation for delay in payment is a part of just compensation, determining the amount of additional compensation for delay
                        in payment is also a judicial function. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 254</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 355 (1986).

                        Legal Rate as Prima Facie Rate. - This section provides for the legal rate as a prima facie rate to be imposed for delay in compensation. This statutory rate is deemed presumptively reasonable. However, the landowner may rebut the rate's reasonableness
                        by introducing evidence of prevailing market rates and demonstrating that the prevailing rates are higher than the statutory rate. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 254</cite>,

                        Compound Interest Allowed for Delayed Placement. - Compound interest should be allowed for delayed payment in condemnation cases if the evidence shows that during the pertinent period the "prudent investor" could have obtained compound interest in the
                        market place. The use of compound interest as a measure in calculating additional compensation for delay is a matter which will turn upon the evidence in each case and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Lea Co. v. North Carolina

                        attorney, appraisal, and engineering fees actually incurred because of the condemnation proceedings only if: (1) "the final judgment is that the Department of Transportation cannot acquire real property by condemnation"; (2) "the

                        Possibility of Two Trials - Although the landowners were required to raise the issue of whether, in the condemnation action against them, they were entitled to have business damages included in a just compensation award in a separate trial than in the
                        condemnation proceeding itself, there was no threat that a second trial on damages would produce an inconsistent verdict; the first trial would involve evidence on just compensation without consideration of business damages and
                        the second trial, if the landowners persuaded a court that business damages should be included in a just compensation award, would be limited to just compensation including business damages. DOT v. Byerly,

                    The General Assembly finds that the rapid growth and the spread of urban development along and near the State highways is encroaching upon or eliminating many areas having significant scenic or aesthetic values, which if restored, preserved and enhanced
                    would promote the enjoyment of travel and the protection of the public investment in highways within the State and would constitute important physical, aesthetic or economic assets to the State. It is the intent of the General Assembly
                    in enacting this statute to provide a means whereby the Department of Transportation may acquire the fee or any lesser interest or right in real property in order to restore, preserve and enhance natural or scenic beauty of areas traversed
                    by the highways of the State highway system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The General Assembly hereby declares that it is a public purpose and in the public interest of the people of North Carolina, to expend public funds, in connection with the construction, reconstruction or improvement of State highways, for the acquisition
                    of the fee or any lesser interest in real property in the vicinity of public highways forming a part of the State highway system, in order to restore, preserve and enhance natural or scenic beauty. The General Assembly hereby finds,
                    determines and declares that this Article is necessary for the immediate preservation and promotion of public convenience, safety and welfare.

                        This Article does not affect signs located in areas zoned commercial or industrial and nothing in it prohibits municipalities from regulating advertising which falls outside its provisions. This interpretation is supported by
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa08s160A-174ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-174(b)</a></cite> which expressly provides that the fact that "a State or federal law, standing alone, makes a given act,
                        omission or condition unlawful shall not preclude city ordinances requiring a higher standard of conduct or condition." Thus, a town is authorized to outlaw outdoor advertising which is not regulated by State law and to provide
                        compensation by amortization since in such instance this Article's compensation provision has no relevance. R.O. Givens, Inc. v. Town of Nags Head, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 294 S.E.2d 388, cert. denied,

                        Effect on Local Regulation - North Carolina's Outdoor Advertising Control Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a11s136-126" target="_self">G.S. 136-126</a></cite> et seq., did not preempt the City of Hendersonville from enforcing
                        a local ordinance affecting billboards, and the record supported the City of Hendersonville Zoning Board of Adjustment's decision that an outdoor advertising company did not meet its burden of proving it was entitled to repair
                        a billboard that was damaged in a windstorm. Lamar Outdoor Adver. v. City of Hendersonville Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 573 S.E.2d 637 (2002).

                        Provision of the Gastonia, North Carolina City Code that governed outdoor billboards conflicted with a regulation that was adopted by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) to implement North Carolina's Outdoor Advertising Control Act,

                        While the Outdoor Advertising Control Act and corresponding North Carolina DOT regulations did not preempt local regulation, nevertheless the DOT's outdoor advertising regulations expressly authorized the relocation of a billboard within certain limitations,
                        and the Stanly County, N.C. Zoning Ordinance made such action unlawful; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa08s160A-174ol1b2" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-174(b)(2)</a></cite>,
                        those regulations preempted the local zoning ordinance. Lamar OCI South Corp. v. Stanly County Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 650 S.E.2d 37 (2007), aff'd, in part, review improvidently

                        Connection Between Cutting of Vegetation and Billboard Not Shown. - Summary judgment for the North Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) was in error as there was no showing that DOT's revocation of the permittee's billboard permit under

Code 2E.0210(11) was within the scope of its authority under the North Carolina Outdoor Advertising Control Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a11s136-126" target="_self">G.S. 136-126</a></cite>                        et seq., as the decision did not contain a finding of fact showing a connection between the cutting of vegetation by agents or employees of the permittee's son and the erection or maintenance of the billboard.

                        Nature of Administrative Appeal to Secretary of Transportation. - There was no provision within the Outdoor Advertising Control Act or the administrative regulations published pursuant to the act which required or provided for anything other than a written
                        administrative appeal to the Secretary of Transportation, and there is no provision for an administrative hearing by the secretary. National Adv. Co. v.

                        Specific Due Process Claim Not Raised Below. - Permittee's claim that the permittee's due process rights were violated because the permittee was being punished for the acts of others was not considered as in the permittee's amended petition for judicial
                        review the permittee raised due process claims based upon no adequate standards to protect against arbitrary and unreasoned decisions in administering the North Carolina Department of Transportation's rules under the North Carolina

                        Administrative Procedure Act does not apply to Outdoor Advertising Control Act or regulations published pursuant to the act because there was no statute or administrative rule which required the Department of Transportation to make an agency decision
                        after providing an opportunity for an adjudicatory hearing, and the subject controversy was therefore not a contested case within the meaning of G.S. 150A-23 (now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba03s150B-23" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-23</a></cite>).

                    The General Assembly hereby finds and declares that outdoor advertising is a legitimate commercial use of private property adjacent to roads and highways but that the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs and devices in areas in the vicinity
                    of the right-of-way of the interstate and primary highway systems within the State should be controlled and regulated in order to promote the safety, health, welfare and convenience and enjoyment of travel on and protection of the
                    public investment in highways within the State, to prevent unreasonable distraction of operators of motor vehicles and to prevent interference with the effectiveness of traffic regulations and to promote safety on the highways, to
                    attract tourists and promote the prosperity, economic well-being and general welfare of the State, and to preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty of the highways and areas in the vicinity of the State highways and to promote
                    the reasonable, orderly and effective display of such signs, displays and devices, and to secure the right of validly permitted outdoor advertising to be clearly viewed by the traveling public. It is the intention of the General Assembly
                    to provide and declare herein a public policy and statutory basis for the regulation and control of outdoor advertising.

                        Preemption of Local Ordinance. - While the Outdoor Advertising Control Act and corresponding North Carolina DOT regulations did not preempt local regulation, nevertheless the DOT's outdoor advertising regulations expressly authorized the relocation of
                        a billboard within certain limitations, and the Stanly County, N.C. Zoning Ordinance made such action unlawful; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa08s160A-174ol1b2" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-174(b)(2)</a></cite>,
                        those regulations preempted the local zoning ordinance. Lamar OCI South Corp. v. Stanly County Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 650 S.E.2d 37 (2007), aff'd, in part, review improvidently

                        Outdoor Advertising Did Not Involve a Fundamental Right. - While the general assembly had declared that outdoor advertising was a legitimate commercial use of private property adjacent to roads and highways, such advertising did not involve a fundamental
                        right, for purposes of a substantive due process analysis of regulations governing the height of billboards. Capital Outdoor, Inc. v. Tolson, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 582 S.E.2d 717

                        Regulation for Aesthetic Reasons. - Police power may be broad enough to include reasonable regulation of property use for aesthetic reasons only. County of Cumberland v. Eastern Fed. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite>                        518, 269 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 527</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 453 (1980).

                    <p>
                        Regulations governing the height of outdoor advertising signs did not violate the substantive due process rights of the outdoor advertising companies which owned them because the regulations did not infringe on a fundamental right, and they were rationally
                        related to the legitimate state interests of safety and aesthetics. Capital Outdoor, Inc. v. Tolson, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 55, 582 S.E.2d 717 (2003).

                        Advertising in Industrial or Commercial Zones. - Outdoor advertising in conformity with the rules and regulations promulgated by North Carolina Department of Transportation is permitted in areas which are zoned industrial or commercial under authority
                        of State law. Naegele Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 205, 465 S.E.2d 549 (1996).

                        Having zoned property as a highway commercial zone under authority of State law and in accordance with a comprehensive plan, the trial court properly concluded that the Secretary's revocation of the permits exceeded his authority under the statutory mandate
                        of subsection (4) which expressly allows advertising in areas which are zoned industrial or commercial under authority of State law. Naegele Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite>                        205, 465 S.E.2d 549 (1996).

                        Preemption of Local Ordinance. - While the Outdoor Advertising Control Act and corresponding North Carolina DOT regulations did not preempt local regulation, nevertheless the DOT's outdoor advertising regulations expressly authorized the relocation of
                        a billboard within certain limitations, and the Stanly County, N.C. Zoning Ordinance made such action unlawful; pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa08s160A-174ol1b2" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-174(b)(2)</a></cite>,
                        those regulations preempted the local zoning ordinance. Lamar OCI South Corp. v. Stanly County Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 650 S.E.2d 37 (2007), aff'd, in part, review improvidently

                        are not compensable. R.O. Givens, Inc. v. Town of Nags Head, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 294 S.E.2d 388, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 127</cite>, 297 S.E.2d 400 (1982).

                    nuisance. The Department of Transportation or its agents shall give 30 days' notice to the owner of the illegal outdoor advertising with the exception of the owner of unlawful portable outdoor advertising for which the Department of
                    Transportation shall give five days' notice, if such owner is known or can by reasonable diligence be ascertained, to remove the outdoor advertising or to make it conform to the provisions of this Article or rules adopted by the Department

                    it conform to the provisions of this Article or rules issued by the Department of Transportation within 30 days after receipt of such notice or five days for owners of portable outdoor advertising. The Department of Transportation
                    or its agents may enter upon private property for the purpose of removing the outdoor advertising prohibited by this Article or rules adopted by the Department of Transportation hereunder without civil or criminal liability. The costs
                    of removing the outdoor advertising, whether by the Department of Transportation or its agents, shall be assessed against the owner of the illegal outdoor advertising by the Department of Transportation. Any person aggrieved by the
                    decision declaring the outdoor advertising structure illegal shall be granted the right to appeal the decision in accordance with the terms of the rules and regulations enacted by the Department of Transportation pursuant to this Article
                    to the Secretary of Transportation who shall make the final decision on the agency appeal.

                    Any person who is aggrieved by a final decision of the Secretary of Transportation after exhausting all administrative remedies made available to him by rules and regulations enacted pursuant to this Article is entitled to judicial review of such decision
                    under this Article. In order to obtain judicial review of the Secretary of Transportation's decision under this Article, the person seeking review must file a petition in the Superior Court of Wake County within 30 days after written
                    copy of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation is served upon the person seeking review. Failure to file such a petition within the time stated shall operate as a waiver of the right of such person to review under this Chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The petition shall state explicitly what exceptions are taken to the decision of the Secretary of Transportation and what relief petitioner seeks. Within 10 days after the petition is filed with the court, the person seeking the review shall serve copies
                    of the petition by registered mail, return receipt requested, upon the Department of Transportation. Within 30 days after receipt of the copy of the petition for review, or within such additional time as the court may allow, the Department
                    of Transportation shall transmit to the reviewing court a certified copy of the written decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At any time before or during the review proceeding, the aggrieved party may apply to the reviewing court for an order staying the operation of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation pending the outcome of the review. The court may grant or deny
                    the stay in its discretion upon such terms as it deems proper. The review of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation under this Article shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall hear the matter de novo pursuant
                    to the rules of evidence as applied in the General Court of Justice. The court, after hearing the matter may affirm, reverse or modify the decision if the decision is:

                        Although the scope of review de novo is broad, the superior court may take action only if the agency decision is (1) in violation of constitutional provisions; (2) not made in accordance with this article or the regulations thereunder; or (3) affected

                        designated by the North Carolina Department of Transportation as a federal-aid secondary road and was therefore not subject to the provisions of the Junkyard Control Act, junkyard owner's assertion that the ordinance was preempted

                </h3>
                <p>
                    Any person who is aggrieved by a final decision of the Secretary of Transportation after exhausting all administrative remedies made available to him by rules and regulations enacted pursuant to this Article is entitled to judicial review of such decision
                    under this Article. In order to obtain judicial review of the Secretary of Transportation's decision under this Article, the person seeking review must file a petition in the superior court of the county in which the junkyard is located
                    within 30 days after written copy of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation is served upon the person seeking review. Failure to file such a petition within the time stated shall operate as a waiver of the right of such person
                    to review under this Chapter.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The petition shall state explicitly what exceptions are taken to the decisions of the Secretary of Transportation and what relief petitioner seeks. Within 10 days after the petition is filed with the court, the person seeking the review shall serve copies
                    of the petition by registered mail, return receipt requested, upon the Department of Transportation. Within 30 days after receipt of the copy of the petition for review, or within such additional time as the court may allow, the Department
                    of Transportation shall transmit to the reviewing court a certified copy of the written decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At any time before or during the review proceeding, the aggrieved party may apply to the reviewing court for an order staying the operation of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation pending the outcome of the review. The court may grant or deny
                    the stay in its discretion upon such terms as it deems proper. The review of the decision of the Secretary of Transportation under this Article shall be conducted by the court without a jury and shall hear the matter de novo pursuant
                    to the rules of evidence as applied in the general court of justice. The court, after hearing the matter may affirm, reverse or modify the decision if the decision is:

                <p>
                    A party to the review proceedings, including the agency, may appeal to the appellate division from the final judgment of the superior court under the rules of procedure applicable in other civil cases. The appealing party may apply to the superior court
                    for a stay for its final determination or a stay of the administrative decision, whichever shall be appropriate, pending the outcome of the appeal to the appellate division.

                    <p>
                        Transfer From Trust Fund to General Fund. - Because one of the objects of the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund is to supplement the State's General Fund, use of the Trust Fund monies for this purpose cannot be viewed as a "raid" of the Trust Fund for
                        purposes not previously sanctioned by the General Assembly; the Trust Fund lacks the indicia of a trust, the language creating the Trust Fund is ambiguous concerning whether the Trust Fund was intended to be a "true" trust fund
                        because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t136a14s136-176" target="_self">G.S. 136-176</a></cite> merely states that a special account is created within the State treasury, not a trust fund, the Trust Fund is
                        not constitutionally protected, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia5As105-187.9" target="_blank">G.S. 105-187.9</a></cite> evinces the intention of the General Assembly to use part of the Trust Fund
                        money to supplement the General Fund. Goldston v. State, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 618, 683 S.E.2d 237 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 802</cite>, 690 S.E.2d 536 (2010).

                        Standing to Challenge Transfers from Trust Fund. - Taxpayers had standing to challenge unlawful or unconstitutional government expenditures and were entitled to seek a declaratory judgment; a trial court erred in dismissing taxpayers' suit, on behalf
                        of themselves and others similarly situated, which challenged money transfers from the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund to the general fund. Goldston v. State, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 26</cite>,

                            When a railroad corporation obtains land in condemnation proceedings, it procures merely an easement, to be used only for railroad purposes. Condemnation is not to be used as a means of acquiring property for the benefit of the corporation, and the corporation

                            Acquisition of Real Property Generally. - A railroad corporation cannot acquire and hold lands for any purposes except such as are authorized by statute. The authority must be conferred by legislation or does not exist. It is, however, not necessary that
                            the authority should be expressly conferred. It may be implied. Wallace v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 114</cite>, 100 S.E. 237 (1919).

                            Extending Use of Right-of-Way. - While a railroad can use only the part of its right-of-way actually occupied, whenever the necessities of the company require it, it can extend its use of the right-of-way to the extent of the statutory right for additional
                            tracks or other railroad purposes. Railroad v. Olive, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 257</cite>, 55 S.E. 263 (1906); Atlantic C.L.R.R. v. Bunting, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 579</cite>, 84 S.E.

                            as safe and convenient to the public as it would have been had the railroad not been built. Raper v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 563</cite>, 36 S.E. 115 (1900).

                            Duty When Railroad Changes Grade of Street. - Where a railroad accepts the benefits of statutory authorization and changes the grade of a street or highway, it must assume and comply with the burden imposed and restore the street to a useful condition.
                            If, to meet the burden so imposed, it becomes necessary to go beyond the railroad right-of-way and change the grade of a street, thereby impairing access of an abutting property owner, compensation must be paid for the diminution
                            in value resulting from the denial of access. Thompson v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 577</cite>, 104 S.E.2d 181 (1958).

         Whole Street Cannot Be Appropriated.
        </b> - It is doubtful whether the statute can be construed to authorize the exclusive appropriation of the street. The sidewalk is a portion of the street appropriated to the use of pedestrians. To construe the grant
                            of the right to construct its road across, along, or upon a street, always of much greater width than a railroad track and the crossties, as a grant of the right to occupy the entire street or sidewalk, is not permissible in
                            the light of the recognized rule of construction of such grants of power. Seaboard Air Line Ry. v. City of Raleigh, 219 F. 573 (E.D.N.C. 1914), aff'd, 242 U.S. 15, 37 S. Ct. 8, 61 L. Ed. 121 (1916).

                            Railroad Decides Necessity of Intersection. - Where a railroad company has a right to condemn a way across the track of another company to manufacturing plants for a spur track to which the other company also has its siding, in competition for freight,
                            the question whether it is necessary for the plaintiff company to build its spur is one in its discretion; and controversies as to whether the defendant could and would shift the plaintiff's cars on its own track advantageously
                            to the plaintiff, and for a reasonable charge, are immaterial. Virginia &amp; C.S.R.R. v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 531</cite>, 78 S.E. 68 (1913), rehearing denied,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A railroad company having the power of condemnation across the road of another company should exercise this right with regard to the convenience of both parties and with as little interference with the use of the other party of its own track as can be
                            obtained without a great increase in its cost and inconvenience. But the courts cannot restrict this right to be exercised by a railroad to cases in which the courts may approve its reasonableness or expediency. Virginia &amp;

                            Agreement or Condemnation Necessary for Entry on Right-of-Way of Another Railroad. - Under this section one road cannot enter on the right-of-way of another for the purpose of connecting therewith without previous agreement or condemnation proceedings.

                            Effect of Parol Agreement. - A parol agreement to allow one railroad company to extend its track on the right-of-way of another, for the purpose of connecting therewith, is a mere license, revocable at the will of the licensor, and will not operate as
                            an estoppel although the licensee has entered and made valuable improvements. Richmond &amp; D.S.R.R. v. Durham &amp; N. Ry., <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 658</cite>, 10 S.E. 659 (1889).

                            One railroad company will not be allowed to preclude competition by another in a particular area by arbitrarily refusing such other railroad reasonable use of its right-of-way and trackage. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,

                        <p>
                            Use of Common Trackage. - The right of each of two railroads to equal use of common trackage does not mean identical use, and where one of them constructs a spur from its independent line to serve a certain area adjacent to such line, but the common trackage
                            is used by it in its operation serving such spur, the other has the right to construct and use a spur from the common trackage when this is the sole feasible means it has to serve industries in the same area, provided such
                            operations will not impair the use of the common trackage by the other. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 495</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 771 (1954).

                            Turnouts, Sidings and Switches. - In the absence of express statutory or charter authorization, the power to construct a railroad includes authority to construct such spur, industrial, switching and other auxiliary tracks as may be necessary to serve
                            the public needs along or near the main line. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 495</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 771 (1954).

                    Whenever the track of a railroad shall cross a highway or turnpike, such highway or turnpike may be carried under or over the track, as may be found most expedient; and in cases where an embankment or cutting shall make a change in the line of such highway

                    purposes aforesaid, compensation therefor shall be ascertained in the manner prescribed in the Chapter Eminent Domain, and duly made by such corporation to the owners and persons interested in such land. The same when so taken shall

                        designed for the protection of the public and are, consequently, safety statutes. Sellers v. CSX Transp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 402 S.E.2d 872 (1991).

                        "Negligent Construction" Defined. - By "negligent construction" is meant such an improper construction of the crossing, whether arising from negligence, indifference, or motives of economy, as unnecessarily increases the danger of using the public highway.
                        Raper v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 563</cite>, 36 S.E. 115 (1900).

                    <p>
                        The mere fact that a crossing is dangerous does not necessarily impute negligence to the railroad company. Edwards v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 78</cite>, 39 S.E. 730 (1901).

                    <p>
                        Duty to Maintain Safe and Convenient Crossing. - While railroad corporations are given the right and power to construct their roads across streets, highways, etc., they must maintain a safe and convenient crossing there, making it, as far as they can,
                        as safe and convenient to the public as it would have been had the railroad not been built. Raper v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 563</cite>, 36 S.E. 115 (1900).

                    <p>
                        The duty of a railroad company with respect to the maintenance of a crossing over its track, where its track has been constructed over an established road, whether public or private, is well settled. The duty is prescribed by this section and has been
                        recognized and enforced by the Supreme Court in numerous decisions. Price v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 32</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 590 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Duty Not Restricted to Public Highways. - The statute does not restrict the railroad's duty to crossings of "public highways," but uses the broader and generic term "highways," which might include any road used by the public as a mill and church road
                        and in going to town. Goforth v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 569</cite>, 57 S.E. 209 (1907).

                    <p>
                        An "established road or way" which a railroad company may not obstruct in crossing it with its tracks includes those whose use is of a private nature, and not necessarily only those dedicated to a public use, and in such instances, where the rights of
                        a railroad and the rights of the public to the use of their roads or ways conflict, the former must give place to the latter. Tate v. Seaboard Air Line Ry., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 523</cite>, 84
                        S.E. 808 (1915).

                    <p>
                        Duty When Railroad Changes Grade of Street. - Where a railroad accepts the benefits of statutory authorization and changes the grade of a street or highway, it must assume and comply with the burden imposed and restore the street to a useful condition.
                        If, to meet the burden so imposed, it becomes necessary to go beyond the railroad right-of-way and change the grade of a street, thereby impairing access of an abutting property owner, compensation must be paid for the diminution
                        in value resulting from the denial of access. Thompson v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 577</cite>, 104 S.E.2d 181 (1958).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In approaching a grade crossing, both the trainmen and travelers upon the highway are under a reciprocal duty to keep a proper lookout and exercise that degree of care which a reasonably prudent person would exercise under the circumstances to avoid an
                        accident at the crossing. Price v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 32</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 590 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Duty of Traveler to Exercise Due Care. - A railroad company is under duty to give travelers timely warning of the approach of its train to a public crossing, but its failure to do so does not relieve a traveler of his duty to exercise due care for his
                        own safety, and the failure of a traveler to exercise such care bars recovery when such failure is a proximate cause of the injury. Price v. Seaboard Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 32</cite>,
                        161 S.E.2d 590 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Right to Assume That Crossing Is Safe. - One has the right to assume that a railroad company has discharged its duty to the public by keeping the crossing in safe condition. Tankard v. Roanoke R.R. &amp; Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 558</cite>,
                        23 S.E. 46 (1895).

                    <p>
                        Yielding Right-of-Way. - Where a railroad track crosses a public highway, though a traveler and a railroad have equal rights to cross, the traveler must yield the right-of-way to the railroad company in the ordinary course of its business. Price v. Seaboard
                        Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 32</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 590 (1968).

                    <p>
                        As to right of former Highway Commission to require railroad to widen crossings upon the widening of a highway, under former G.S. 60-43, see Atlantic C.L.R.R. v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 92</cite>, 150

                    <p>
                        Indictments. - An indictment charging a railroad company with obstructing a public road by the use of plank at a crossing is fatally defective if it does not charge the manner of the misuse of the plank. State v. Roanoke R.R. &amp; Lumber Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 860</cite>, 13 S.E. 719 (1891).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a fatal variance in an indictment for obstructing a highway at a railroad crossing, to prove that the defendant permitted for some time a dangerous hole to remain in the crossing. State v. Roanoke R.R. &amp; Lumber Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 860</cite>, 13 S.E. 719 (1891).

                    <p>
                        Nonsuit Held Error. - It was error for the trial court to sustain a motion of nonsuit on competent evidence from which the jury could have found that if defendant's crossing over a neighborhood road had not been negligently left in a dangerous condition,
                        plaintiff would not have been injured by the slipping and falling thereon of the mule upon which he was riding. Goforth v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 569</cite>, 57 S.E. 209 (1907).

                        The General Assembly can make the abolition of grade crossings by railroads imperative instead of leaving it, as now, unexercised in the discretion of the Commission, and can place the cost of doing so upon the corporation whose duty it is to remove them.

                        Effect of Posting Notice. - When notice provision has been complied with, a rule of a railroad company prohibiting passengers from going on the platform while the train is in motion is given the force and effect of a State law, barring a recovery for

                        Ejection of Passenger Without Making Sufficient Inquiries as Negligence. - Where plaintiff purchased through transportation to a destination to reach which it was necessary to change, but the conductor on the first train neglected to return plaintiff's
                        ticket, and when the conductor of the second train asked for his fare, plaintiff, having no money, vainly attempted to borrow from men who had been on the first train with him, it was negligence on the conductor's part not to have

                        Passenger Need Not Pay Additional Fare to Prevent Ejection. - Where a passenger is about to be wrongfully ejected from a train, having paid his fare thereon, but being unable to produce his ticket, it is not incumbent on him, by paying money which the
                        conductor has no right to exact, to avoid ejection from the train, as he is not required to buy again his right to remain on the train to his destination. Sawyer v. Norfolk S.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 13</cite>,

                    The General Assembly finds that:

                        Increased use of rail for transport of freight will reduce highway congestion as well as allow economic expansion in a way that lessens the impact on the State highway system.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol12">
                        Public transportation, in addition to a program of urban loops and toll roads, will enable North Carolina to have a balanced 21st century transportation system.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol13">
                        As part of its initial program of internal improvements, the State capitalized the North Carolina Railroad in the 1840s and invested in other railroads, and those internal improvements led to North Carolina's rapid economic development. The North Carolina
                        Railroad, with a 317-mile corridor from Charlotte to Morehead City, is still owned by the State.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol14">
                        Improved rail facilities and restoration of abandoned rail lines can allow increased access to the North Carolina State ports and military installations located within the State.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol15">
                        Session Law 2005-222 found that expanding and upgrading passenger, freight, commuter, and short-line rail service is important to the economy of North Carolina; and provided that the State would seek to provide matching funds partly so it can leverage
                        the maximum federal and private participation to fund needed rail initiatives, such as the restoration of the rail corridor from Wallace to Castle Hayne and a rail connection between north-south and east-west routes in the vicinity
                        of Pembroke.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol16">
                        Rail freight plays a vital role in economic development throughout the State. Intermodal service depends on partnerships with railroads, trucking companies, seaports, and others in the transportation logistics chain. North Carolina has 3,250 mainline
                        miles of track, with Class I railroads holding seventy-nine percent (79%) of the trackage rights, the remainder controlled by local railroads and switching and terminal railroads. The 2006 Mid-Cycle Update to the North Carolina
                        Statewide Intermodal Transportation Plan identified seven hundred ninety-nine million dollars ($799,000,000) in freight rail needs over the next 25 years, including maintenance and preservation, modernization, and expansion.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol17">
                        North Carolina's short-line railroads play a key role in the State's economic development and transportation service and are needed to provide essential services to other modes of transportation and the North Carolina port system. North Carolina agriculture
                        is dependent upon essential service by short-line railroads. State funds are needed to maintain short-line railroads as viable contributors to economic development, agriculture, and transportation in this State in order to prevent
                        the loss of regional rail service. The Department of Transportation reported that 44,992 rail cars handled by short-lines kept 179,688 trucks off North Carolina highways. Short-line railroads are essential to preserve and develop
                        jobs in rural and small urban areas of North Carolina.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol18">
                        Intermodal facilities and inland ports can greatly reduce freight traffic on North Carolina's highway system, reducing demand, congestion, and damage.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol19">
                        The proposed North Carolina International Terminal will need high-capacity intermodal access.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol110">
                        Most of North Carolina's growth is in its urban regions. According to the State Data Center, during the first decade of the 21st century, sixty-six percent (66%) of the projected 1,270,000 growth in population is in 15 urban counties surrounding Charlotte,
                        Raleigh, and the Triad, while forty percent (40%) is in just six counties: Mecklenburg, Wake, Durham, Orange, Forsyth, and Guilford.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t136a19s136-251ol111">
                        This large urban population growth greatly taxes resources. Despite the visionary creation of the Highway Trust Fund by the 1989 General Assembly and the funding of urban loop highways, congestion continues to worsen. Creation of a special fund to help
                        meet urban transportation needs with alternatives such as rail transit and buses, coupled with land-use planning, will spur and guide economic development in a more economically and environmentally sound manner. Investment in public
                        transportation facilitates economic opportunity to the State through job creation, access to employment, and residential and commercial development. Public transportation also protects the public health by decreasing air pollution
                        and reducing carbon emissions. It reduces traffic congestion, road expenditures, public and private parking costs, and the number of traffic accidents. Charlotte's recent success in opening the first phase of its light rail system,
                        with ridership significantly over projections, shows that North Carolinians are willing to use transportation alternatives.
                    </li>

                        Significant local revenues are needed to match State funds so that a major portion of the expenses is borne by the localities receiving the majority of the benefits. A local option sales tax for public transportation was approved by a fifty-eight percent
                        (58%) favorable vote in Mecklenburg County in 1998 and reaffirmed by a seventy percent (70%) favorable vote in 2007. Extending this authority to additional jurisdictions, along with other revenue options, will enable localities
                        to demonstrate local support for additional transit options.

                        Surveys have indicated broad public support for providing additional public transportation options and for allowing localities to generate revenue to match State grants.

                    Session Laws 2002-126, s. 6.6(e), provides: "As part of a plan to reorganize and consolidate rail operations at the State Ports, the North Carolina State Ports Authority may sell or transfer the Beaufort and Morehead Railway, Inc., or any part thereof
                    or interest therein, to a terminal switching or short line railroad company, or to the North Carolina Railroad Company, on such terms and conditions as the parties may agree to."

                    Ports Authority to status as a common carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act. Subsections (a) through (e) of this section become effective only if an opinion is issued that it does not subject the State Ports Authority to status
                    as a common carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act, and in such case subsections (a) through (e) of this section become effective upon the issuance of the opinion. In lieu of subsections (a) through (e) of this section, if the North
                    Carolina State Ports Authority finds that the transfer of any stock owned by the North Carolina Ports Railway Commission to the North Carolina State Ports Authority will accomplish the same end as the transfer of assets of the North
                    Carolina Ports Railway Commission, it may order such transfer if the Attorney General issues an opinion it does not subject the State Ports Authority to status as a common carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act, and in such case
                    the transfer becomes effective 60 days after it is ordered."

                    On November 12, 2002, the Office of the Attorney General issued an Advisory Opinion, as required by Session Laws 2002-126, s. 6.6(f), stating that the North Carolina State Ports Authority is not a common carrier subject to the Railway Labor Act by virtue
                    of Session Laws 2002-126, s. 6.6(a)-(e). The opinion should be available on the official website of the Office of the Attorney General by the end of 2002 (website at http://www.ncdoj.gov/About-DOJ/Legal-Services/Legal-Opinions /Opinions/State-Ports-Authority.aspx).

                        the North Carolina State Ports Authority, through its Executive Director, shall give notice in writing of the Authority's intent to exercise the exemption to the Secretary of Administration. The notice shall contain, at a minimum,
                        the following information: (i) the specific statutory requirement or requirements from which the Authority intends to exercise an exemption; (ii) the reason the exemption is necessary to expedite delivery of a port facility; and
                        (iii) the way the Authority anticipates the exemption will expedite the delivery of a port facility. The Authority shall report quarterly to the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations on any building contracts
                        exceeding two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) to which an exemption authorized by this subsection is applied.
