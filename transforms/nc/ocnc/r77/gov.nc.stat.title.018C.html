   - While the state-operated lottery according to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t18Ca01s18C-102" target="_self">G.S. 18C-102</a></cite> was established to generate funds for the public purposes named in the state's lottery law, namely, the education-related projects outlined in the law's provisions, the revenue-raising purpose of the lottery was not a critical factor in determining whether the law imposed a tax and, thus, had to be enacted according to the requirements of N.C. Const., Art. II,

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t18Ca04s18C-134ol1a">
       Purpose. - The Commission must establish a debt set-off program by which lottery prize payments may be used to satisfy a debt owed or collected by a claimant agency that is at least fifty dollars ($50.00). The collection remedy under this section is in addition to and not in substitution for any other remedy available by law.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ca04s18C-134ol1b">
       Notification. - A claimant agency is automatically enrolled in the Commission's debt set-off program if it is enrolled in the Department of Revenue debt set-off program. To provide for more efficient operations, the Department of Revenue shall provide to the Commission on a periodic basis all updates to its debt set-off program as soon as practicable.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ca04s18C-134ol1c">
       Setoff. - The Commission must match the information submitted by the claimant agency with persons who are entitled to a State lottery prize payment in an amount of six hundred dollars ($600.00) or more. If there is a match, the Commission must set off the debt against the lottery winnings to which the debtor would otherwise be entitled. When there are multiple claims to be set off, the priority in claims to set off is the same as provided in G.S. 105A-12. The winnings that exceed the amount of the debt, if any, must be paid to that person. The Commission must mail the debtor written notice that the setoff has occurred and must transfer the net proceeds collected to the claimant agency. If the claimant agency is a State agency, that agency must credit the amount received to a nonreverting trust account and must follow the procedure set in G.S. 105A-8.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ca04s18C-134ol1d">
       Collection Assistance Fee. - To recover the costs incurred by the Commission in collecting debts under this section, a collection assistance fee of five dollars ($5.00) may be imposed on each debt collected through setoff. The Commission must collect this fee as part of the debt and retain it. To recover the costs incurred by local agencies in submitting debts for collection under this section, a collection assistance fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) may be imposed on each local agency debt collected through setoff. The Commission must collect this fee as part of the debt and remit it to the clearinghouse that submitted the debt. The collection assistance fees do not apply to child support debts. If the Commission is able to collect only part of a debt through setoff, the Commission's collection assistance fee has priority over the local collection assistance fee and over the remainder of the debt. The local collection assistance fee has priority over the remainder of the debt.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ca04s18C-134ol1e">
       Confidentiality. - Notwithstanding any confidentiality statute of a claimant agency, the exchange of information among the Commission, the Department of Revenue, the claimant agency, the organization submitting debts on behalf of a local agency, and the debtor necessary to implement this section is lawful. The information an agency or organization obtains from the Commission in accordance with the exemption in this subsection may be used by the agency or organization only in the pursuit of its debt collection duties and practices.
      </li>
      <li id="t18Ca04s18C-134ol1f">
       Definitions. - The definitions in G.S. 105A-2 apply in this section.

     <p>
      The Commission shall be exempt from Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html" target="_blank">Chapter 143</a></cite> of the General Statutes but may use the services of the Department of Administration in procuring goods and services for the Commission. However, the Commission shall include in all contracts to be awarded by the Commission under this section a standard clause which provides that the State Auditor and internal auditors of the Commission may audit the records of the contractor during and after the term of the contract to verify accounts and data affecting fees and performance. The Commission shall not award a cost plus percentage of cost contract for any purpose. For purposes of this provision, "cost plus percentage of cost contract" is defined as a contract under which the contractor receives payment for indeterminate costs plus a stated percentage or amount of profit based upon such costs. This provision shall not apply to Commission contracts that require costs to be predetermined and approved by the Commission and a total not to exceed the amount specified in each contract to be paid to the contractor.

       State's lottery law was not a revenue bill
   
   and, thus, its provisions such as G.S. 18-162(a) allowing for allocation of total annual revenues were not enacted in violation of the requirements set forth in N.C. Const., Art. II,

   23. The law did not: (1) raise money on the credit of the State; (2) pledge the faith of the State directly or indirectly for the payment of any debt; or (3) impose any tax upon the people of the State, but, rather, allowed citizens to participate in a voluntary activity that incidentally raised revenue.

        CASE NOTES
       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       State's lottery law was not a revenue bill
   
   and, thus, its provisions such as G.S. 18-164(a) allowing for net revenues to be transferred periodically to the Education Lottery Fund, were not enacted in violation of the requirements set forth in N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23. The law did not: (1) raise money on the credit of the State; (2) pledge the faith of the State directly or indirectly for the payment of any debt; or (3) impose any tax upon the people of the State, but, rather, allowed citizens to participate in a voluntary activity that incidentally raised revenue. Heatherly v. State, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 213, 658 S.E.2d 11 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 115</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 656 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Privilege Tax on Cyber-Gambling Establishments Was Constitutional.
   
   - City's privilege license tax on cyber-gambling establishments was not invalid because it exempted state-endorsed lotteries from taxation, as the state-endorsed lotteries provided net revenues to the State Education Lottery Fund and thus reasonably constituted a separate classification from unendorsed gambling. IMT, Inc. v. City of Lumberton, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 724 S.E.2d 588 (2012).
