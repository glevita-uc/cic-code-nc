     § 99A-1. Recovery of damages for interference with property rights.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    Notwithstanding any other provisions of the General Statutes of North Carolina, when personal property is wrongfully taken and carried away from the owner or person in lawful possession of such property without his consent and with the intent to permanently deprive him of the use, possession and enjoyment of said property, a right of action arises for recovery of actual and punitive damages from any person who has or has had, possession of said property knowing the property to be stolen.
   </p>
   <p>
    An agent having possession, actual or constructive, of property lawfully owned by his principal, shall have a right of action in behalf of his principal for any unlawful interference with that possession by a third person.
   </p>
   <p>
    In cases of bailments where the possession is in the bailee, a trespass committed during the existence of the bailment shall give a right of action to the bailee for the interference with his special property and a concurrent right of action to the bailor for the interference with his general property.
   </p>
   <p>
    Any abuse of, or damage done to, the personal property of another or one who is in possession thereof, unlawfully, is a trespass for which damages may be recovered.

     CASE NOTES
    </b>
   </h4>
   <p>
    Owner May Collect Actual and Punitive Damages from One Criminally Guilty of Receiving Stolen Property.
   
   - It is reasonably clear that the first paragraph of this section is fairly consistent with the title of the bill from which it was enacted, and that the owner of stolen property may collect actual and punitive damages from one who is criminally guilty of receiving the stolen property. Russell v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 246 S.E.2d 569 (1978).
   </p>
   <p>
    This section creates a right of action in the owner, his agent or a bailee of stolen property for recovery of damages from one who is criminally guilty of receiving stolen property. Noell v. Winston, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 276 S.E.2d 766, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 315</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 652 (1981).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Finding of Knowledge by Defendant Required to Support Award Under First Paragraph.
   
   - No actual or punitive damages could be awarded pursuant to the first paragraph of this section in an action in which the plaintiff alleged that the defendant sold a mobile home to her and thereafter wrongfully took possession of and converted the mobile home and its contents, where there was no finding of fact that the defendant received the property knowing it to be stolen. Russell v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 246 S.E.2d 569 (1978).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Paragraphs two and three of this section merely create rights of action
   
   in agents of the owners and bailees of the personal property the possession of which has been unlawfully interfered with. Russell v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 246 S.E.2d 569 (1978).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Punitive Damages Not Authorized Under Last Paragraph.
   
   - Applying a strict construction to the last paragraph of this section, it does not authorize the recovery of punitive damages. Russell v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 246 S.E.2d 569 (1978).
   </p>
   <p>
    While the last paragraph of this section provides for the recovery of damages for an "unlawful" abuse of or damage to the personal property of another, it says nothing about punitive damages. Russell v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 246 S.E.2d 569 (1978).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Deletion of Attorney's Name from Appointment Lists.
   
   - Plaintiff attorney's allegations that defendant members of a county bar association committee had deleted plaintiff's name from indigent defendant appointment lists and that the district bar had not adopted a plan authorizing defendants to formulate rules for appointment of counsel failed to state a claim for damages based on a denial of due process or trespass against plaintiff's property rights under this section. Noell v. Winston, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 276 S.E.2d 766, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 315</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 652 (1981).
