                    he has reason to believe that the defendant, or his agents or employees, are or have been trespassing upon his mine, or working the defendant's mine in such a manner as to damage or endanger the plaintiff 's property. Upon the filing

                    20 days from the date thereof, and show cause why an order of survey should not be granted. Upon the hearing, and for good cause shown, the judge shall grant an order directed to some competent disinterested surveyor or mining engineer,
                    or both, as the case may be, who shall proceed to make the necessary examination and surveys, as directed by the court, and report their action to the court. The persons selected by the judge to make the survey and examination shall
                    be residents of the State, and, before entering upon the discharge of their duty, shall take and subscribe an oath that they will fairly and impartially survey the mines described in the petition. In all other respects, except as stated

                    The General Assembly finds that the extraction of minerals by mining is a basic and essential activity making an important contribution to the economic well-being of North Carolina and the nation. Furthermore, it is not practical to extract minerals required
                    by our society without disturbing the surface of the earth and producing waste materials, and the very character of certain surface mining operations precludes complete restoration of the land to its original condition. However, it
                    is possible to conduct mining in such a way as to minimize its effects on the surrounding environment. Furthermore, proper reclamation of mined land is necessary to prevent undesirable land and water conditions that would be detrimental
                    to the general welfare, health, safety, beauty, and property rights of the citizens of the State. The General Assembly finds that the conduct of mining and reclamation of mined lands as provided by this Article will allow the mining
                    of valuable minerals and will provide for the protection of the State's environment and for the subsequent beneficial use of the mined and reclaimed land.

                    The operator shall submit with his application for an operating permit a proposed reclamation plan.

                    plus such other information as may be reasonably required by the Department. The reclamation plan shall provide that reclamation activities, particularly those relating to control of erosion, shall to the extent feasible be conducted
                    simultaneously with mining operations and in any event be initiated at the earliest practicable time after completion or termination of mining on any segment of the permit area. The plan shall provide that reclamation activities shall
                    be completed within two years after completion or termination of mining on each segment of the area for which a permit is requested unless a longer period is specifically permitted by the Department.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Department may approve, approve subject to stated modifications, or reject the plan which is proposed. The Department shall approve a reclamation plan (as submitted or as modified) only where it finds that it adequately provides for those actions
                    necessary to achieve the purposes and requirements of this Article, and that in addition, the plan meets the following minimum standards:

                    effective and (ii) any permit application for a mining operation pending or submitted on or after that date. No later than December 1, 2017, the Department shall issue life-of-site permits or life-of-lease permits, as applicable, to
                    replace valid permits for existing mining operations issued before the date this act becomes effective in compliance with the provisions of this act. Until such time as life-of-site permits or life-of-lease permits, as applicable,
                    have been issued to replace valid permits for existing mining operations issued before the date this act becomes effective, any valid permit and its terms and conditions shall remain in effect and govern the operations of the facility
                    notwithstanding any termination date that may be included in such permit."

                        County zoning board exceeded its authority when it voided a mine operator's special use exception permit after finding violations, then treated the mine operator's current permit application as one for a new permit and applied the standard under a new
                        ordinance; the board did not have the power to void the original permit, but only to impose civil or criminal penalties for the violations. Hewett v. County of Brunswick, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite>                        138, 573 S.E.2d 688 (2002).

                    The General Assembly finds that exploration for uranium within the State has the potential to lead to employment opportunities and other economic benefits for the citizens of North Carolina.

                    through whatever reasonable means it chooses, to perform the abandonment and other work required by this Article. The bond or other security shall be continuous in nature and shall remain in force until cancelled by the guarantor.
                    Cancellation shall be effectuated upon written notice thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Department and to the permit holder, and shall be effective no sooner than 60 days following receipt by the Department

                    The bond or other security shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance of the requirements set forth in this Article and of the rules adopted pursuant to it. Liability under the bond or other security shall remain in effect until completion of
                    abandonment or until substitution of a good and sufficient bond or other security acceptable to the Department. In no event shall the liability of the surety exceed the amount of the bond or other security required by this section.

                    a good and sufficient bond or other security acceptable to the Department. Upon failure of the permit holder to make the required substitution, his permit shall automatically become void and of no effect. Any continuation of exploration
