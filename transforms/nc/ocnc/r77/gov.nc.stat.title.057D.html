                    the interrogatories must be answered within 30 days after the mailing thereof, or within such additional time as the Secretary of State may fix, and the answers thereto must be full and complete and made in writing and under oath.
                    If the interrogatories are directed to an individual, they must be answered by the individual, and if directed to a limited liability company, they must be answered by a manager or other company official thereof. The Secretary of State
                    shall certify to the Attorney General for such action all interrogatories and answers thereto that disclose a violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter requiring or permitting action by the Attorney General.

                        may serve persons whom the applicant either is unable to locate or are unknown by publication made in the same manner as the publication of notice under G.S. 57D-6-11. A guardian ad litem may be appointed for any interest owners
                        who are infants or incompetent. The receiver shall enter into a bond if the court requires one and shall give notice to creditors by publication or otherwise as the court may prescribe. Any creditor who fails to file a claim with
                        the receiver within the time set will be barred of the right to participate in the distribution of the assets. The receiver may (i) sell the property interests of the limited liability company on such terms and in such manner as

                        interest owners, or their representatives, of their shares of the limited liability company's remaining assets.

                        Superior Court Judgment In Contravention of Injunction Entered in District Court. - Superior court erred by ordering a beneficiary to transfer the assets of a limited liability company to a trust because there was a prior valid and binding order in the
                        district court prohibiting such transfers in the beneficiary's equitable distribution action against a co-trustee, who was her husband; the beneficiary's trust pursuit claim, which was brought initially before the clerk of superior
                        court and subsequently before the superior court, sought to do what the beneficiary had specifically agreed not to do, transfer title to real estate during the pendency of the equitable distribution action, and the judgment of
                        the superior court ordering the transfer of title of real estate was in direct contravention of the injunction previously entered by the district court. Keith v. Wallerich, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite>                        550, 687 S.E.2d 299 (2009).

                        the statute required written authorization for the affidavit filed in this case, there was no requirement that the existence of the authorization be recited in the affidavit. An order establishing a mechanic's lien was improper

                        Lawyer, who was a member of a professional limited liability company, owed no duty to a trustee and a beneficiary for the misconduct of his partner, and summary judgment for the lawyer in a claim by trustee and beneficiary based on the partner's misconduct
                        in dealing with an estate and trust was proper because the Limited Liability Company Act did not require the lawyer to investigate his partner absent actual knowledge of the misconduct. Babb v. Bynum &amp; Murphrey, PLLC,

                        Where a member of a limited liability company (LLC) claimed that another member fraudulently spent the LLC's assets, the debtor, the sole managing member of the LLC, was not personally liable to the member because, pursuant to G.S. 57C-3-30(a) (now repealed),
                        the debtor's status as a managing member did not make him personally liable for the LLC's debts. Selvido v. Gillespie (In re Gillespie), - Bankr. - (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Mar. 26, 2012).

                        Summary judgment was granted in favor of a debtor on nondischargeability and other claims arising out of a real estate development project, as the creditors could not establish his liability through acts of a limited liability company in which he had
                        an ownership interest because under G.S. 57C-3-30(a) (now repealed), his liability as a member was limited to his own acts. Nor did he owe the creditors a fiduciary duty, as he was not a real estate agent or broker. Fazzari v.

                        Tenant Not Entitled to Recover Damages Against LLC Manager. - When a limited liability company (LLC) manager distributed the LLC's assets after terminating a lease with a tenant, the tenant was not entitled to recover damages against the manager because,
                        even if the distribution of the LLC's assets violated G.S. 57C-4-06 (now repealed), any liability to which the manager would be subject pursuant to G.S. 57C-4-07 (now repealed) would lie in favor of the LLC and not in favor of
                        the tenant, as, in spite of the tenant's claim to be entitled to benefit from the manager's alleged violation of G.S. 57C-4-06 (now repealed), the tenant did not argue that the tenant had the right to force the LLC to sue the manager,
                        that the LLC would be legally required to seek recovery from the manager pursuant to G.S. 57C-4-07 (now repealed), or that the tenant had the ability to enforce any rights that the LLC might have against the manager. Rev O, Inc.

                        Forced Sale of Judgment Debtor's Membership Interests Properly Refused. - Trial court properly ordered defendant debtor's distributions and allocations from certain limited liability companies in which the debtor had membership interests to be applied
                        to satisfy a judgment, and properly denied plaintiff assignee's motion to order the membership interests to be seized and sold, because pursuant to G.S. 57C-5-03 (now repealed), the trial court was allowed to charge the membership
                        interests with payment of the judgment. Nevertheless, such charging did not entitle the assignee to become a member or exercise a member's rights, and therefore, because forcing the sale of the membership interests to satisfy the
                        debt would have entailed the assignee becoming a member of the limited liability companies, a forced sale like that otherwise allowed by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Xa31s1-362" target="_blank">G.S. 1-362</a></cite>                        was prohibited.

                        Equitable Estoppel Not Available. - Equitable estoppel could not be used in effect to create an operating agreement governing withdrawal pursuant to G.S. 57C-5-06 (now repealed) from a professional limited liability company that had no operating agreement;
                        thus, defendants' argument that, at the time plaintiffs filed their derivative claims, they had already withdrawn from the limited liability company, were not members of it, and did not have standing to file a derivative suit,

        Statute Does Not Provide for Remedy in Event of Non-Compliance.
       </b> - G.S. 57C-6-05 (now repealed) did not provide for a remedy in the event of non-compliance, and the court, therefore, had discretion to fashion a proper remedy. In the instant case, (i) though the transfers may have
                        been ultra vires, they in no significant manner caused any harm to the creditor, (ii) the complete, and extensive cross-collateralization of the creditor's debt fully protected it, (iii) the transfers which were not effectuated
                        in accordance with G.S. 57C-6-05 (now repealed) did not change the amount of the debt, the obligors on the debt, or the collateral securing the debt, and (iv) the court was not persuaded that avoidance of the transfers would be

                        that the attorney demanded that the attorney's partner who was a comanager and member of the LLC share the proceeds from the cases retained through the LLC. Crouse v. Mineo, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite>                        232, 658 S.E.2d 33 (2008).

                        Equitable estoppel could not be used in effect to create an operating agreement governing withdrawal pursuant to G.S. 57C-5-06 (now repealed) from a professional limited liability company that had no operating agreement; thus, defendants' argument that,
                        at the time plaintiffs filed their derivative claims, they had already withdrawn from the limited liability company, were not members of it, and did not have standing to file a derivative suit, was without merit as no written operating
