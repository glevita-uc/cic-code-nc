                        Duty to Restrain Stock. - This section imposes upon all persons the statutory duty of restraining their stock from running at large. McCoy v. Tillman, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 201</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 683 (1944).

Sutton v. Duke, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite>                        100, 171 S.E.2d 343 (1969), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 94</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 161 (1970).

                        This section implies knowledge, consent or willingness on the part of the owner that the animals be at large, or negligence equivalent thereto, and the mere fact that animals are at large does not raise the presumption that the owner permits them to run
                        at large, nor does the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur apply upon the establishment of the facts that animals are found at large. Gardner v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 573</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 10 (1940).

                        Liability of Animal's Keeper Rests on Question of Negligence. - The keeper of a pony, mule or other animal is liable under this section for negligently permitting such animal to escape and go upon public highways in the event it does damage to travelers
                        or others lawfully thereon. The liability of the keeper rests upon the question of whether the keeper is guilty of negligence in permitting such animal to escape. The same rules as to what is or is not negligence in ordinary situations
                        apply. Sutton v. Duke, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 171 S.E.2d 343 (1969), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 94</cite>, 176 S.E.2d 161 (1970).
