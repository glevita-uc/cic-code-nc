                        City or County May Appropriate and Expend Public Funds for Acquisition or Construction. - The acquisition of land for, and the construction and operation of, an airport for use by the public is a purpose for which a city or a county or both may appropriate
                        and expend public funds and for which it or they may acquire land by the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Materiality of Amount of Use in Immediate Future. - In a taking of land for the construction of an airport, as in the case of a taking for the construction of a road, if the taking is, in reality, for the purpose of making the property available for use
                        by the public, it is immaterial that, in the immediate future, only a small segment of the public will be likely to make actual use of it. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>,
                        155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that at the time of the taking of land by eminent domain for the purpose of building an airport there are no commitments from commercial air lines and the immediate prospect is for use only by a small number of private planes, is irrelevant where
                        there is no suggestion that the airport would not be available and eventually used as a public facility. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).

                        Taking of Land to Provide Clear Approach to Runway. - The taking of land so as to provide for airplanes an approach to the runway of the airport free from trees and structures of considerable height is reasonably incidental to the construction of such
                        an airport. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).

        Operation of Airport Is Proprietary and Nongovernmental Function.
       </b> - The operation and maintenance of a municipal airport and its facilities is a proprietary or nongovernmental function or undertaking of the city for a public purpose, and for which the municipality may be held liable
                        in tort for negligence in the operation thereof. Jewell Ridge Coal Corp. v. City of Charlotte, 204 F. Supp. 256 (W.D.N.C. 1962).

                        Flights over Private Land as Taking. - Flights over private land are not a taking, unless they are so low and so frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land. Cochran v. City of Charlotte,
                        <cite

                        A compensable taking of a flight or aviation easement does not occur until overflights constitute a material interference with the use and enjoyment of property, such that there is substantial diminution in fair market value. Cochran v. City of Charlotte,
                        <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 281 S.E.2d 179 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 725</cite>, 288 S.E.2d 380 (1982).

                        Inverse Condemnation Action for Frequent Overflights. - Failure to condemn directly under this section for damage to property caused by frequent overflights allows plaintiffs, if they wish compensation for the diminution in value of their properties,
                        the sole alternative of an action for inverse condemnation. Cochran v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 281 S.E.2d 179 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 725</cite>,

                        Judgments in Aviation Easement Cases. - Because the interest taken vests in the governmental entity, judgments in aviation easement cases should describe the easement acquired in terms of (1) frequency of flight, (2) permissible altitude, (3) type of
                        aircraft, and (4) duration. Cochran v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 281 S.E.2d 179 (1981), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 725</cite>, 288 S.E.2d 380 (1982).
