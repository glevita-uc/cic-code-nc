    <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1a">
     The purpose of this Chapter is to protect the safety and welfare of students, faculty, and staff in institutions of higher education by fostering integrity, proficiency, and competence among campus police agencies and campus police officers. To achieve this purpose, the General Assembly finds that a Campus Police Program needs to be established. As part of the Campus Police Program, the Attorney General is given the authority to certify a private, nonprofit institution of higher education, other than those described by G.S. 116-15(d), as a campus police agency and to commission an individual as a campus police officer.
    </li>
    <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b">
     The purpose of this Chapter is also to assure, to the extent consistent with the State and federal constitutions, that this protection is not denied to students, faculty, and staff at private, nonprofit institutions of higher education originally established by or affiliated with religious denominations. To achieve this purpose, the General Assembly finds that:
     <ol>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b1">
       Most of the State's private, nonprofit institutions of higher education were originally established by or affiliated with religious denominations;
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b2">
       These institutions have made and continue to make significant contributions in education to the State and the nation;
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b3">
       These institutions admit students regardless of their spiritual or religious beliefs;
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b4">
       These institutions' principal mission is educational;
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b5">
       All of these institutions are accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and as such have independent governing boards of trustees;
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b6">
       The principal State power conferred on campus police by this Chapter is the power of arrest;
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b7">
       This power is important to protect the safety and welfare of students, faculty, and staff at these institutions;
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b8">
       In exercising the power of arrest, these officers apply standards established by State and federal law only; and
      </li>
      <li id="t74Gs74G-2ol1b9">
       The exercise of this power is reviewable by the General Court of Justice and the federal courts.

     Public educational institutions operating under the authority of the Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina or the State Board of Community Colleges and private educational institutions that are licensed by the Board of Governors of The University of North Carolina pursuant to G.S. 116-15 or that are exempt from licensure by the Board of Governors pursuant to G.S. 116-15(c) may apply to the Attorney General to be certified as a campus police agency. A campus police agency may apply to the Attorney General to commission an individual designated by the agency to act as a campus police officer for the agency.

State v. Yencer, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 292</cite>, 718 S.E.2d 615 (2011).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Stop and Seizure.
   
   - Denial of defendant's motion to suppress a college campus police officer's stop and seizure of defendant was improper, as the college was a religious institution and delegation of police power to the college under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t74Gs74G-2" target="_self">G.S. 74G-2</a></cite> was a violation of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause. State v. Yencer, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 552, 696 S.E.2d 875 (2010).
   </p>
   <p>
    Because campus police officers, like municipal police officers, act pursuant to authority granted by the General Assembly under the Campus Police Act, and their duties involve the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power, the campus police officers were entitled to public official immunity for their acts in furtherance of their official duties so long as those acts were not corrupt, malicious, or outside of and beyond the scope of their duties.

     An applicant for certification as a campus police agency must file with the Attorney General either a copy of a liability insurance policy that meets the requirements of this section or a certificate of self-insurance designating assets sufficient to satisfy the coverage requirements of this section if the applicant is a nonpublic entity. The policy or certificate of self-insurance must provide not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) of coverage per incident for personal injury or property damage resulting from a negligent act of the applicant or an agent or employee of the applicant operating in the course and scope of employment or under color of law. The form, execution, and terms of a liability insurance policy must meet the requirements of the Attorney General.
    </li>
    <li id="t74Gs74G-3ol1b">
     An insurance carrier that issues a liability insurance policy required by this section may cancel the policy upon giving 30 days' written notice to both the campus police agency and the Attorney General. The written notice must be given by certified mail, return receipt requested. Cancellation of a liability insurance policy does not affect any liability on the policy that accrued prior to the effective cancellation date.
    </li>
    <li id="t74Gs74G-3ol1c">
     A campus police agency that is a nonpublic entity must maintain the liability insurance policy or certificate of self-insurance required by this section in effect at all times. The Attorney General shall suspend the certification of a campus police agency that fails to maintain a liability insurance policy or certificate of self-insurance when required to do so by this section. A certification suspended for this reason may not be reinstated until the person whose certification was suspended files with the Attorney General an application for reinstatement and either the required liability insurance policy or certificate of self-insurance.

    </li>
    <li id="t74Gs74G-6ol1f">
     Exclusive Authority. - Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the authority granted to campus police officers certified under this Chapter shall be limited to the provisions of this Chapter.

    Because campus police officers, like municipal police officers, act pursuant to authority granted by the General Assembly under the Campus Police Act, and their duties involve the exercise of some portion of the sovereign power, the campus police officers were entitled to public official immunity for their acts in furtherance of their official duties so long as those acts were not corrupt, malicious, or outside of and beyond the scope of their duties.
