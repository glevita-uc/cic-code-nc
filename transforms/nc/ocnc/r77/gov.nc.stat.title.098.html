   <p>
    When the office of any registry is destroyed by fire or other accident, and the records and other papers thereof are burnt or destroyed, the copies of all such proceedings, instruments and papers as are of record or registry, certified by the proper officer, though without the seal of office, shall be received in evidence whenever the original or duly certified exemplifications would be. Such copies, when the court is satisfied of their genuineness, may be ordered to be recorded or registered.

   <p>
    Admissibility of Parol Evidence.
   
   - This Chapter is an enabling act and does not exclude oral evidence, admissible at common law, to prove the contents of a lost deed or record. Hughes v. Pritchard, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 23</cite>, 68 S.E. 906 (1910). See Mobley v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 284</cite>, 3 S.E. 677 (1887); Varner v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 570</cite>, 17 S.E. 483 (1893).
   </p>
   <p>
    When a deed is lost or destroyed, a copy must be produced if there is one, but if there is none, parol evidence may be admitted to prove its contents. Baker v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. 43</cite> (1794); Dumas v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. 103</cite> (1831); Cowles v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 231</cite> (1884).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Parol Evidence Not Admissible to Change Certified Copy.
   
   - This section does not permit parol evidence to be introduced to show that the lost or destroyed original had a different description and thus correct a recorded certified copy of a deed. Hopper v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 418</cite>, 16 S.E. 626 (1892).

    Jurisdiction.
   
   - Jurisdiction in the superior court sustained. McCormick v. Jernigan, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 406</cite>, 14 S.E. 971 (1892).
   </p>
   <p>
    Jurisdiction in the superior court tacitly recognized. Tuttle v. Rainey, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 513</cite>, 4 S.E. 475 (1887).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Section Is Not Exclusive.
   
   - In an action to establish a lost deed, the record of which was also destroyed, a motion to dismiss upon the ground that the action should have been brought under G.S. 56 of the Code (now this section) was properly refused, as the section is an enabling act giving an additional, but not an exclusive, remedy. Jones v. Ballou, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 526</cite>, 52 S.E. 254 (1905).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Use of Common Law to Establish Contents.
   
   - A party whose deed with its registration had been destroyed, instead of having it set up and recorded, could depend upon the rules of the common law to establish its contents whenever an occasion might arise, as in the course of a trial. Cowles v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 231</cite> (1884); Mobley v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 284</cite>, 3 S.E. 677 (1887); Hopper v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 418</cite>, 16 S.E. 626 (1892).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Compliance with Statute.
   
   - When the proceeding is brought by virtue of G.S. 56 of the Code (now this section), its requirements must be complied with. Cowles v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. 577</cite> (1878); Jones v. Ballou, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 526</cite>, 52 S.E. 254 (1905).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Original Recorded by Clerk upon Sufficient Evidence.
   
   - Where the registry of partition is destroyed and a paper purporting to be the original is presented to the clerk, it is his duty, after satisfying himself upon evidence that the paper is the original one, to record it. Hill v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 267</cite>, 62 S.E. 1074 (1908).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Effect of Failure to Register Anew.
   
   - This statutory provision admonished all persons having such original papers to prove and register them anew in the way prescribed, and good faith required that they should do so. Moreover, it gave the public reason to expect that it would be faithfully observed by persons interested. Thus, where the plaintiff has been negligent in again registering or recording an original deed, such reregistration would not defeat the rights of bona fide purchasers. Waters v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 394</cite>, 11 S.E. 240 (1890).

     § 98-3. Establishing boundaries and interest, where conveyance and copy lost.
    </b>
   </h3>
   <p>
    When any conveyance of real estate, or of any right or interest therein, is lost, the registry thereof being also destroyed, any person claiming under the same may cause the boundaries thereof to be established in the manner provided in the Chapter entitled Boundaries, or he may proceed in the following manner to establish both the boundaries and the nature of his estate:
   </p>
   <p>
    He shall file his petition before the clerk of the superior court, setting forth the whole substance of the conveyance as truly and specifically as he can, the location and boundaries of his land, whose land it adjoins, the estate claimed therein, and a prayer to have his own boundaries established and the nature of his estate declared.
   </p>
   <p>
    All persons claiming any estate in the premises, and those whose lands adjoin, shall be notified of the proceedings. Unless they or some of them, by answer on oath, deny the truth of all or some of the matters alleged, the clerk shall order a surveyor to run and designate the boundaries of the petitioner's land, and return his survey, with a plot thereof, to the court. This, when confirmed, shall, with the declaration of the court as to the nature of the estate of the petitioner, be registered and have, as to the persons notified, the effect of a deed for the same, executed by the person possessed of the same next before the petitioner. But in all cases, however, wherein the process of surveying is disputed, and the surveyor is forbidden to proceed by any person interested, the same proceedings shall be had as under the Chapter entitled Boundaries.
   </p>
   <p>
    If any of the persons notified deny by answer the truth of the conveyance, the clerk shall transfer the issues of fact to the superior court, to be tried as other issues of fact are required by law to be tried; and on the verdict and the pleadings the judge shall adjudge the rights of the parties, and declare the contents of the deed, if any deed is found by the jury, and allow the registration of such judgment and declaration, which shall have the force and effect of a deed.

    Remedy Additional and Not Exclusive.
   
   - This section is an enabling statute providing, not an exclusive remedy, but merely an additional one. Mobley v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 284</cite>, 3 S.E. 677 (1887); Jones v. Ballou, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 526</cite>, 52 S.E. 254 (1905).

   <p>
    This section does not repeal but rather aids the common-law rules for establishing deeds, and a party may choose either mode. Cowles v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 231</cite> (1884).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Evidence Must Show Existence, Nature and Loss.
   
   - Before the deed can be made, the plaintiff must clearly prove that a deed did exist, its legal operation, and the loss thereof. Plummer v. Baskerville, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. 252</cite> (1840); Loftin v. Loftin, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. 94</cite>, 1 S.E. 837 (1887).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Judgment Only Has Force of Original.
   
   - A judgment under this section has only such force as the original conveyance would have as evidence had it not been destroyed. McNeely v. Laxton, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 327</cite>, 63 S.E. 278 (1908).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Private Acts.
   
   - In a special proceeding under a private act, similar to this section, to restore certain records lost by fire or other casualty, it is necessary to conform exactly to all the terms prescribed by the statute. Cowles v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. 577</cite> (1878).

     § 98-4. Copy of lost will may be probated.

   <p>
    In counties where the original wills on file in the office of the clerk of superior court, and will books containing copies, are lost or destroyed, if the executor or any other person has preserved a copy of a will (the original being so lost or destroyed) with a certificate appended, signed by a clerk of the court in whose office the will was, or is required to be filed, stating that said copy is a correct one, this copy may be admitted to probate, under the same rules and in the same manner as now prescribed by law for proving wills. The proceedings in such cases shall be the same as though such copy was the original offered for the first time for probate, except that the clerk who signed such certificate shall, on oath, acknowledge his signature, or in case it appears that he has died or left the State, then his signature shall be proved by a competent witness; and the witness or witnesses to the original, who may be examined, shall be required to swear that he or they signed in the presence of the testator and by his direction a paper-writing purporting to be his last will and testament.

    Every person who has been in the continual, peaceable and quiet possession of land, tenements, or hereditaments, situated in the county, claiming, using and occupying them as his own, for the space of seven years, under known boundaries, the title thereto being out of the State, is deemed to have been lawfully possessed, under color of title, of such estate therein as has been claimed by him during his possession, although he may exhibit no conveyance therefor: Provided, that such possession commenced before the destruction of the registry office, or other destruction as aforesaid, and also that any such person, or any person claiming by, through or under him, makes affidavit and produces such proof as is satisfactory to the court that the possession was rightfully taken; and if taken under a written conveyance, that the registry thereof was destroyed by fire or other means, or was destroyed before registry as aforesaid, and that neither the original nor any copy thereof is in existence: Provided further, that such presumption shall not arise against infants, persons of nonsane memory, and persons residing out of the State, who were such at the time of possession taken, and were not therefore barred, nor were so barred at the time of the burning of the office or other destruction.

   the plaintiff showed title out of the State by a 30 years' possession. It was held that this statute did not make it necessary to show seven years' adverse possession in addition to the 30 years. The lapse of seven years' adverse possession concurrently with the 30 years was sufficient. Hill v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 393</cite> (1879).

    Affidavit by Agent Held Insufficient.
   
   - In a proceeding under this section, an affidavit by the agent of the petitioner to the effect that the facts set forth in the complaint were "true to the best of his knowledge, information and belief" was an insufficient verification.

    Waiver of Verification.
   
   - The requirement that when one pleading in a court of record is verified, every subsequent pleading in the same proceeding, except a demurrer, must be verified also, is one which may be waived except in those cases where the form and substance of the verification is made an essential part of the pleading, as in an action for divorce in which a special form of affidavit is required under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-8" target="_blank">G.S. 50-8</a></cite>, or in a proceeding to restore a lost record under this section.

    Negligently Delayed Reregistration Held Not to Affect Rights of Bona Fide Purchasers.

Nor could reregistration of the defeasance in 1886, after the registration of the mesne conveyances to the innocent purchasers, avail to defeat their rights. Waters v.
