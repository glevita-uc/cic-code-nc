                        soil cannot obstruct. State v. Narrows Island Club, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 477</cite>, 5 S.E. 411 (1888).

                        "Motive Power" Defined. - Water used in "sluicing" is not used as a "motive power" within the meaning of this section. The section has obvious reference to the use of the energies of water dammed, as a moving force, and not to the operation of the current
                        in motion. State v. Duplin Canal Co., <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 637</cite> (1884).

                    <p>
                        Indictment. - The indictment under this section must charge that the obstruction was not "for the purpose of utilizing." Such a charge is not necessary in an indictment for obstructing waters, at common law. State v. Narrows Island Club,

                        Railroad Bridges. - A railroad bridge built over a navigable stream if obstructing passage of vessels is a nuisance, and tearing a portion of it down so that vessels may pass is not indictable.

                        Action for Damages. - In an action wherein actual damages were claimed, with punitive damages, for damming a navigable stream, made a misdemeanor by this section, it was held that to recover punitive damages it was insufficient to show merely that the
                        stream was obstructed to plaintiff 's damage, it being necessary to prove, in such cases, malice, fraud, wanton or willful disregard of the plaintiff 's rights, or other circumstances of recklessness or aggravation. Warren v. Coharie

                    If any person, firm or corporation shall fell any tree or put any slabs, stumpage, sawdust, shavings, lime, refuse or any other substances in any creek, stream, river or natural or artificial drainage ravine or ditch, or in any other outlet which serves
                    to remove water from any land whatsoever whereby the drainage of said land is impeded, delayed or prevented, the person, firm or corporation so offending shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor: Provided, however, nothing herein shall
                    prevent the construction of any dam or weir not otherwise prohibited by any valid local or State statute or regulation. In addition to any fine or imprisonment imposed, the court may, in its discretion, order the person, firm, or corporation
                    so offending to remove the obstruction and restore the affected waterway to an undisturbed condition, or allow authorized employees of the enforcing agency to enter upon the property and accomplish the removal of the obstruction and
                    the restoration of the waterway to an undisturbed condition, in which case the costs of the removal and restoration shall be paid to the enforcing agency by the offending party. This section may be enforced by marine fisheries inspectors
                    and wildlife protectors. Within the boundaries of any county or municipality this section may also be enforced by any law enforcement officer having territorial jurisdiction, or by the county engineer. This section may also be enforced
                    by specially commissioned forest law-enforcement officers of the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for offenses occurring in woodlands. For purposes of this section, the term "woodlands" means all forested areas, including
                    swamp and timber lands, cutover lands and second-growth stands on previously cultivated sites.

                        Dismissal of Suit Upheld. - Dismissal of a suit brought by a group of beachfront landowners against the State of North Carolina, the State of North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the Coastal Resources Commission, the Division
                        of Coastal Management, and its director, was upheld on appeal because the landowners failed to allege in their complaint sufficient allegations to establish that the State of North Carolina asserted any claim of title to their
                        land under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a01s41-10.1" target="_blank">G.S. 41-10.1</a></cite> to have constituted a waiver of the state's sovereign immunity with regard to the
                        landowners' suit to prevent the general public from interfering with their use of certain beach property, which the landowners claimed was deeded to them. Fabrikant v.

                <p>
                    The two counties may by joint ordinance create the High Rock Lake Marine Commission. The Boards shall hold a public hearing on the joint ordinance to create the Commission. The location of the public hearing shall be determined by the Boards and established
                    by resolution. The Boards shall cause notice of the hearing to be published once a week for two successive calendar weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in each county. The notice shall be published the first time not less than
                    10 days nor more than 25 days before the date fixed for the hearing. Upon its creation the Commission shall enjoy the powers and have the duties and responsibilities conferred upon it by joint ordinance, subject to the provisions of
                    this Article and the laws of the State of North Carolina. The provisions of any joint ordinance may be modified, amended, or rescinded by a subsequent joint ordinance. A county may unilaterally withdraw from participation as required
                    by any joint ordinance or the provisions of this Article, once the Commission has been created. Any county may unilaterally withdraw from the Commission at the end of its fiscal year, by written notification to the other county and
                    the Commission of its intent to withdraw, with notification 90 days prior to the end of the fiscal year. Upon the effectuation of the withdrawal, the Commission is dissolved, and all property of the Commission shall be distributed
                    to or divided among the two counties and any other public agency or agencies serving the High Rock Lake area in a manner considered equitable by the Commission by resolution adopted prior to dissolution.

                    then by the Rowan County Board of Commissioners, and thereafter shall alternate between the two Boards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These appointees shall serve until December 31 following their appointment. Thereafter, appointments shall be made for terms beginning each January 1 by the respective Boards of the two counties as follows:

                    for two-year terms, and one appointed for a three-year term. Subsequent appointees shall serve three-year terms. The alternating commissioner, to be initially appointed by Davidson County, shall initially serve a one-year term and
                    thereafter serve a two-year term.

                        Resources Commission pass local regulations on this subject in accordance with the procedure established by appropriate State law.

                        mailed a notice of the proposed classification by first-class mail at the last addresses listed for such owners on the county tax abstracts. This mailing requirement does not apply in regulations affecting the entire lake. Notice
                        shall also be given by a sign, uniform waterway marker, posted notice, or other effective method of communicating the essential provisions of the regulation in the immediate vicinity of the location in question. Where a regulation

                        shall also be given by a sign, uniform waterway marker, posted notice, or other effective method of communicating the essential provisions of the regulation in the immediate vicinity of the location in question. Where a regulation
