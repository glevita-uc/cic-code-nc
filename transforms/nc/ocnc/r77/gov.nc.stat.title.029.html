      History
     </p>
     <p>
      (1959, c. 879, s. 1.)
     </p>
     <p>
      Editor's Note.
   
   - Session Laws 1959, c. 879, s. 1 inserted this present Chapter numbered 29 and entitled "Intestate Succession" to replace former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite> entitled "Descents." By the same act G.S. 28-149, with regard to order of distribution, was repealed and other related statutory provisions were repealed or amended to conform with the new Intestate Succession Law. Section 15 of the 1959 act provides: "This act shall become effective July 1, 1960, and shall be applicable only to estates of persons dying on or after July 1, 1960."
     </p>
     <p>
      Some of the cases cited in the notes to the sections of this Chapter construe similar provisions of the former Chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Section 4.1 of Session Laws 1963, c. 1209, provides that from and after the certification of the constitutional amendment to G.S. 6 of Art. X (see now N.C. Const. Art. X, G.S. 4) which was proposed by c. 1209, wherever the word "spouse" appears in the General Statutes with reference to testate or intestate successions, it shall apply alike to both husband and wife. The approval of the amendment by vote of the people was certified by the Governor on February 6, 1964.

         Some of the cases below were decided under prior law.
        </b>
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Chapter.
   
   - Taken as a whole, this Chapter conveys an intent by the legislature to write a reasonable will for those residents who have not done so. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Descents are regulated by statute
   
   in this State. Edwards v. Yearby, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 663</cite>, 85 S.E. 19 (1915); University of N.C. v. Markham, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 338</cite>, 93 S.E. 845 (1917).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       English Canons of Descent Formerly Followed.
   
   - The English canons of descent remained in force in North Carolina until 1784. Because certain provisions seemed repugnant to republican principles, the legislature was led to make the changes which distinguish this section from the English act. Clement v. Cauble, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. 82</cite> (1854).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative Intent as to Effect of Adoption.
   
   - The General Assembly, on its own motion and also in response to judicial decisions, has, with every amendment and every rewrite of G.S. 48-23, evidenced its intent that by adoption the child adopted becomes legally a child of its new parents, and the adoption makes him legally a stranger to the bloodline of his natural parents. Crumpton v. Crumpton, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 221 S.E.2d 390 (1976), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 281 S.E.2d 1 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrongful Death Beneficiaries Determined as of Time of Death.
   
   - The persons who, under the Intestate Succession Act, are entitled to the recovery in a wrongful death action are to be determined as of the time of the decedent's death. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Hackney, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 17</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 352 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Proof of the death of a person raises a presumption that such person died intestate.
   
   Collins v. R.L. Coleman &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 478</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 803 (1964).

       "Advancement" means an irrevocable inter vivos gift of property, made by an intestate donor to any person who would be the donor's heir or one of the donor's heirs upon the donor's death, and intended by the intestate donor to enable the donee to anticipate the donee's inheritance to the extent of the gift; except that no gift to a spouse shall be considered an advancement unless so designated by the intestate donor in a writing signed by the donor at the time of the gift.
      </li>
      <li id="t29a01s29-2ol12">
       "Estate" means all the property of a decedent, including but not limited to:

   - Where a child accepts a deed with knowledge that the lands conveyed therein represent an advancement of his full share of the parents' realty, he is estopped to claim any other lands owned by the parents at the time of their deaths.

        "Estate" Defined.
   
   - Estate of a decedent includes all property owned by decedent which she may direct to her legatees and devisees under will and which would pass to her heirs and next of kin under laws of intestacy if she died without will. In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 101</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 150 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The distinction between a vested and a contingent remainder is the capacity to take upon the termination of the preceding estate.
   
   Strickland v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 81</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 22 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where those who are to take in remainder cannot be determined until the happening of a stated event, the remainder is contingent. Strickland v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 81</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 22 (1963).

        Computation of Net Estate.
   
   - To ascertain "net estate" under subdivision (5) it is necessary to subtract from the value of the gross estate, "family allowances, costs of administration, and all lawful claims against the estate." Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal Estate Tax Is "Lawful Claim."
   
   - The federal estate tax is one of the "lawful claims" against testator's estate, and the widow's intestate share of the estate is to be computed after its deduction. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legacies Not Excluded in Determining Net Estate.
   
   - The phrase "all lawful claims against the estate," as used in subdivision (5), does not include either specific legacies or general legacies for specific amounts. If it did, the net estate in many instances would be so deleted by their payment that it would be insufficient to provide the widow with the same share of her husband's real and personal property as if he died intestate. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As Legacies or Distributive Shares Are Not "Lawful Claims."
   
   - In the use of the phrase "lawful claims against the estate" in subdivision (5), the legislature was not referring to claims of beneficiaries created either by the will or the statute of descents and distributions. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 255</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 387 (1963).

       </p>
       <p>
        Property Owned as Tenants by the Entirety.
   
   - The value of real property owned by couple as tenants by the entirety should not be included in testatrix's net estate for purposes of the dissent statute. In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 381 S.E.2d 484, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 708</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 456 (1989).

        Residue of Net Estate after Distribution to Dissenting Widow.
   
   - When the dissenting widow was entitled to one half of the deceased spouse's net estate as defined in subdivision (5) of this section, former G.S. 30-3(c) said that the residue of the testator's net estate for distribution to other devisees and legatees was as defined in this section.

       Rights of collateral succession are limited to the descendants of the intestate's parents or grandparents.
   
   This section limits such succession to those persons who are within five degrees of kinship to the intestate, and the effect of the proviso engrafted upon this section is to provide for unlimited succession by collateral kinsmen descended from the intestate's parents or grandparents in the event there are no collateral kinsmen of the fifth degree in such lines of descent.

   - This section at most imposes a limitation upon intestate succession, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-15" target="_self">G.S. 29-15</a></cite>, and by its proviso restates the existing effect of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-15" target="_self">G.S. 29-15</a></cite>, i.e., that collateral descent shall be unlimited when it is within the parentela of an intestate's parents or grandparents. Thus, in enacting this section, the legislature did not intend to eliminate escheats. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).

       Effect of Section as to Escheat under G.S.
   
   29-12. - This section has no application to escheat under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-12" target="_self">G.S. 29-12</a></cite> unless the common ancestor of the collateral kin and the decedent is a parent or grandparent of the decedent. In such an event the main clause in this section operates to exclude a collateral kinsman of a sixth or higher degree from succeeding to the estate, even though he is a lineal descendent of the decedent's parents or grandparents. The proviso in this section, in order to prevent the escheat of the decedent's estate, provides for unlimited succession by collateral kinsmen who are descendants of the decedent's parents or grandparents when there is no such collateral kinsman within the fifth degree.

   - Where, as gleaned from will itself, the intent of the testator was that the residue of his estate was to pass to named beneficiaries under the residuary clause of the will only if testator's wife survived him, and she did not, the residue would pass to his heirs at law in accordance with the laws of intestacy as enacted by the legislature. McKinney v. Mosteller, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 730</cite>, 365 S.E.2d 612 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent did not provide a testamentary disposition of four parcels of land, either specifically or through a residuary clause, the land did not pass under decedent's will, but instead qualified as a partial intestacy.

       Child Born after 10 Months.
   
   - If a child is born more than 10 lunar months or 280 days after the death of the intestate, the presumption is that the child was not en ventre sa mere when the intestate died, but this presumption may be rebutted by evidence tending to show that he was in fact the father of the child.

       There is a distinction between derelict property and escheated property.
   
   An escheat occurs when the property owner dies intestate and without relatives descended from a common parent or grandparent. North Carolina State Treas. v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 300 S.E.2d 283 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption That Distant Relatives Not Included in Will.
   
   - Underlying this provision for escheat of the estate in the absence of certain relatives is a logical presumption that the intestate would not have included distant relatives in his will. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-7" target="_self">G.S. 29-7</a></cite> as to Escheat under This Section.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-7" target="_self">G.S. 29-7</a></cite> has no application to escheat under this section unless the common ancestor of the collateral kin and the decedent is a parent or grandparent of the decedent. In such an event the main clause in G.S. 29-7 operates to exclude a collateral kinsman of a sixth or higher degree from succeeding to the estate, even though he is a lineal descendent of the decedent's parents or grandparents. The proviso in G.S. 29-7 in order to prevent the escheat of the decedent's estate provides for unlimited succession by collateral kinsmen who are descendants of the decedent's parents or grandparents when there is no such collateral kinsman within the fifth degree. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 392, 232 S.E.2d 213, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-7" target="_self">G.S. 29-7</a></cite> at most imposes a limitation upon intestate succession, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-15" target="_self">G.S. 29-15</a></cite>, and by its proviso restates the existing effect of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-15" target="_self">G.S. 29-15</a></cite>, i.e., that collateral descent shall be unlimited when it is within the parentela of an intestate's parents or grandparents. Thus, in enacting <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-7" target="_self">G.S. 29-7</a></cite>, the legislature did not intend to eliminate escheats. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).

       Unrefunded ticket proceeds is neither abandoned nor derelict property.
   
   By purchasing a ticket to a concert, the ticket holder enters into a contract with the auditorium and the performer. If the contract is not performed, he or she may rescind the agreement and demand a refund, but is not compelled to do so. Nor must the auditorium operator or performer refund the purchase price absent a demand. If that were the case, the ticket holder would be unjustly enriched in retaining both money and memento. The auditorium is not a trustee of the unrefunded proceeds of the ticket sale; the auditorium is simply a party to an unperformed contract. North Carolina State Treas. v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 300 S.E.2d 283 (1983).

       The power of the legislature
   
   to determine who shall take the property of a person dying subsequent to the effective date of a legislative act cannot be doubted. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Law at Time of Death Governs.
   
   - It is well settled that an estate must be distributed among heirs and distributees according to the law as it exists at the time of the death of the ancestor. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Even Though Decedent Became Incompetent to Make Will Before Law Changed.
   
   - Where it was alleged that an intestate became mentally incapable of making a will prior to ratification of the Intestate Succession Act on June 10, 1959, and that such mental incapacity continued until his death, and it was contended that the intestate's personal estate should be distributed in accordance with the Intestate Succession Law as it existed on June 9, 1959, it was held that this contention assumes: Before he became mentally incapable of making a will, the intestate had knowledge of and was pleased with the statutes of descent and distribution; if he had made a will, he would have disposed of his estate as provided by the statutes then in effect; he would have been displeased with the provisions of the 1959 act; and, but for his mental incapacity, would have made a will disposing of his estate as provided by the statutes in effect prior to ratification of the 1959 act. Such successive assumptions underlying the contention are unwarranted. They relate to matters that lie wholly within the realm of speculation. The intestate had no vested right in the statutes of descent and distribution in effect prior to the ratification of the 1959 act. He was charged with knowledge that these statutes were subject to change by the General Assembly. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Determinative fact is that the intestate made no will.
   
   Hence, his estate "shall descend and be distributed" in accordance with the statutes in effect on the date of his death, namely, this Chapter. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).

       Wife Waived Right to Dissent from Will.
   
   - Where, by the terms of a deed of separation a wife released her right to take a widow's share of her husband's estate, she thereby waived her right to dissent from his will. Sloop v. Sloop, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 295, 210 S.E.2d 262 (1974).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Intent to Release Share Implicit in Separation Agreement.
   
   - Where the intention of each party to the marriage to release his or her share in the estate of the other is implicit in the express provisions of their separation agreement, their situation and purpose at the time the instrument was executed, the law will imply release of rights under this section and specifically enforce the agreement. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 622 (1973).
      </p>

       Provisions in a separation agreement that each would thereafter acquire, hold, and dispose of property as though unmarried and that each renounced the right to administer upon the estate of the other refuted the contention that one spouse intended to retain any rights in the other's estate.

       Wife May Be Administratrix Where Marital Relations Resumed.
   
   - Where, after the execution of a separation agreement and consent judgment between husband and wife, the wife returned to the marital home which she and her husband shared before the separation; thereafter the commissioners named in the consent judgment to sell the couple's joint property for division were instructed not to do so; the husband paid the wife's attorney for representing her in the litigation between them; and from the time the wife returned to the marital home until her husband's death, the husband and wife lived continuously in their marital residence, the wife was entitled to qualify as administratrix of the estate of her husband and share in his estate as his widow without prejudice by reason of the separation agreement and consent judgment.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       This section defines the share of the surviving spouse
   
   of an intestate. Tolson v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 506</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 135 (1963); Peoples Oil Co. v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 696</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 369 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Words Describing Relationships Bear Ordinary Meanings.
   
   - In carefully naming the persons who take in cases of intestacy using words describing family relationships such as "parents," "brothers," "sisters," "grandparents," "aunts" and "uncles," the legislature intended that these words bear their ordinary and usual meaning. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Words Cannot Be Expanded.
   
   - The words "brother," "parent" and "grandparent" cannot be expanded to include other relationships such as "great-grandfather" or "great uncle." Therefore, the maxim, "Expressio unius est exclusio alterius" (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another) tends to exclude collateral kin who are not in the parentela of the intestate's parents or grandparents. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of "Share" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-2" target="_self">G.S. 29-2(6)</a></cite> Applies.
   
   - The definition contained in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-2" target="_self">G.S. 29-2(6)</a></cite> is intended to apply when "share" is used "to describe the share of a net estate or property," e.g., a share under this section which thus "includes . . . the undivided fractional interest in the real property." Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The intestate share does not include the value of property passing by survivorship
   
   (which includes property owned as tenants by the entirety), joint accounts with right of survivorship, and insurance payable to the surviving spouse. In re Estate of Connor, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 168 S.E.2d 245 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Estate Does Not Include Property Conveyed Away Prior to Death.
   
   - For purposes of this section a wife's husband's estate would not include property which he had conveyed away prior to his death, even though she had not joined in the conveyance. Heller v. Heller, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 171 S.E.2d 335 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       A deed by plaintiff's husband, which was executed while he and plaintiff were living together and which conveyed his separate real property to his children by a prior marriage, was effective to convey title to the children free from any claims of plaintiff. Heller v. Heller, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 171 S.E.2d 335 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Insofar as concerns any rights which the spouse of a married person might acquire by virtue of the provisions of this section, the General Assembly has prescribed no regulation or limitations relating to the conveyance during lifetime by such married person of his or her separate real or personal property. Heller v. Heller, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 171 S.E.2d 335 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Present Right of Possession Not Conferred.
   
   - A wife is not a real party in interest so as to interpose as a defense or counterclaim, in an action in ejectment instituted by her husband's grantee, that her husband had fraudulently conveyed the lands without her joinder in order to deprive her of the possession thereof, since this section, defining the share of the surviving spouse of an intestate, and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a08s29-30" target="_self">G.S. 29-30</a></cite>, providing for a life estate at the election of the surviving spouse, do not give her a present right of possession. Peoples Oil Co. v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 696</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 369 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Surviving Wife and Child Each Take Undivided One Half of Lands.
   
   - Upon the death of an intestate, title to his lands immediately vests in his wife and child under this section, each taking a one-half undivided interest in fee. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Share of Second or Successive Spouse.
   
   - Former G.S. 30-3(b), which provided that a second or successive spouse who dissented from the will of his deceased spouse should take only one half the amount provided by the Intestate Succession Act for the surviving spouse if the testator had surviving him lineal descendants by a former marriage but there were not surviving lineal descendants by the second or successive marriage, was not arbitrarily discriminatory and capricious so as to be violative of the due process provisions of the federal and State Constitutions. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Absence of Lineal Descendants.
   
   - There being no lineal descendants, under this section the surviving widow is entitled to "all the net estate" of an intestate. Johnson v. Blackwelder, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 209</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 30 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent was not survived by a child, children, or any lineal decedent of a deceased child or children, or by a parent, surviving spouse was proper recipient of remainder interest in four parcels of land that passed as partial intestacy. Tarlton v. Stidham, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 469 S.E.2d 38 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife's right to dissent from her husband's will
   
   depends on whether she is entitled to take a widow's share of his estate under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-13" target="_self">G.S. 29-13</a></cite> and this section. Sloop v. Sloop, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 295, 210 S.E.2d 262 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife Waived Right to Dissent from Will.
   
   - Where by the terms of a deed of separation a wife released her right to take a widow's share of her husband's estate, she thereby waived her right to dissent from his will. Sloop v. Sloop, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 295, 210 S.E.2d 262 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Distribution of Estate When Surviving Spouse Dissents from Will.
   
   - When a surviving spouse dissents from a will, the intestate share should be allocated so as to cause the least possible disruption of the decedent's plan for the distribution of his estate. In partitioning testatrix's property, her will should be given consideration, and insofar as possible the beneficiaries of the will should receive the property testatrix intended for them to receive. In re Estate of Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 235 S.E.2d 924, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 253</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 535 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not purport to give a dissenting spouse the right to select the particular property he or she will receive in opposition to the dominant intent expressed in a will. The dominant intent expressed in the will is still controlling so long as it can be carried out and leave the dissenting spouse with the prescribed interest in value in the estate. In re Estate of Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 235 S.E.2d 924, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 253</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 535 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrongful Death Action.
   
   - In a wrongful death action, the real parties in interest were the beneficiaries as defined in the Wrongful Death Act, who were the same persons who would have received property had the decedent died intestate; where the decedent was not survived by a child, children, or any lineal descendant of a deceased child or children, or by a parent, the decedent's spouse received all of the wrongful death proceeds, and where the widow was not entitled to a wrongful death recovery, the remaining beneficiaries did not succeed to a full 100 percent, but only received their original percentage, so there were no beneficiaries to the wrongful death claim. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 571 S.E.2d 668 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 673</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 272 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent's ex-spouse abandoned her interest in the decedent's estate at the time of death, decedent's siblings were entitled to share in any wrongful death proceeds, distribution was dictated by the laws of intestacy, and decedent's sister, as administratrix had standing to file the action. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 113</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 543 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrongful Act Bars Husband from Share of Wrongful Death Recovery.
   
   - Where it is a husband's wrongful act which caused the death of his wife intestate, he may not share in a recovery from an action for wrongful death. Should the jury return a verdict in favor of the administrator of her estate, the court will enter judgment for only two thirds of the amount of the verdict. Cummings v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 183 S.E.2d 832, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 726</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 883 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       In an action by an administrator under the Wrongful Death Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.028A.html#t28Aa18s28A-18-2" target="_blank">G.S. 28A-18-2</a></cite>, where husband caused the death of his wife, the award must be reduced by the statutory share of the wrongdoer. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lack, 476 F.2d 583 (4th Cir. 1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This result is not precluded by the "slayer statute,"
   
   <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa03s31A-4" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-4</a></cite>, which excludes the wrongdoer from taking by declaring him to have constructively died prior to the deceased, since the slayer's exclusion by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa03s31A-4" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-4</a></cite> appears to apply only to inheritance from the decedent's "estate," while wrongful death awards have consistently been deemed not to pass through the personal estate of the deceased, but rather to arise out of a right of action belonging peculiarly to the personal representative for the benefit of the intestate successors. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. v. Lack, 476 F.2d 583 (4th Cir. 1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Any or all of the marital rights under this section may be surrendered
   
   by a properly drawn separation agreement complying with the requirements of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-6" target="_blank">G.S. 52-6</a></cite>. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 198 S.E.2d 45, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 622 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Remarriage Restores All Rights and Privileges.
   
   - When a married couple enters into a separation agreement, later divorces, and then remarries, each party to the marriage regains all rights and privileges incident to marriage unless there is evidence to the contrary. Batten v. Batten, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 685, 482 S.E.2d 18 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Intent to Release Share Implicit in Separation Agreement.
   
   - Where the intention of each party to the marriage to release his or her share in the estate of the other is implicit in the express provisions of their separation agreement, their situation and purpose at the time the instrument was executed, the law will imply release of rights under this section and specifically enforce the agreement. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 622 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provisions in a separation agreement that each would thereafter acquire, hold, and dispose of property as though unmarried and that each renounced the right to administer upon the estate of the other refuted the contention that one spouse intended to retain any rights in the other's estate. Lane v. Scarborough, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 407</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 622 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife May Be Administratrix Where Marital Relations Resumed.
   
   - Where, after the execution of a separation agreement and consent judgment between husband and wife, the wife returned to the marital home which she and her husband shared before the separation; thereafter the commissioners named in the consent judgment to sell the couple's joint property for division were instructed not to do so; the husband paid the wife's attorney for representing her in the litigation between them; and from the time the wife returned to the marital home until her husband's death, the husband and wife lived continuously in their marital residence, the wife was entitled to qualify as administratrix of the estate of her husband and share in his estate as his widow without prejudice by reason of the separation agreement and consent judgment. In re Estate of Adamee, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 386</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 541 (1976).

       Words Describing Relationships Bear Ordinary Meanings.
   
   - In carefully naming the persons who take in cases of intestacy using words describing family relationships such as "parents," "brothers," "sisters," "grandparents," "aunts" and "uncles," the legislature intended that these words bear their ordinary and usual meaning. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Words Cannot Be Expanded.
   
   - The words "brother," "parent" and "grandparent" cannot be expanded to include other relationships such as "great-grandfather" or "great uncle." Therefore, the maxim "Expressio unius est exclusio alterius" (the expression of one thing is the exclusion of another) tends to exclude collateral kin who are not in the parentela of the intestate's parents or grandparents. Newlin v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 348</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 819 (1977).

   - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.031A.html#t31Aa02s31A-2" target="_blank">G.S. 31A-2</a></cite>, which specifies acts barring rights of parents to intestate succession in child's estate and to administer child's estate, must be deemed a part of the Intestate Succession Act and a modification of subdivision (3) of this section, as fully as if it had been written thereinto or specifically designated as an amendment thereto. Williford v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 506</cite>, 219 S.E.2d 220 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When a gift is made to a class of "heirs," the intestacy laws govern
   
   not only the identification of the "heirs," but also the shares to which they are entitled. Rawls v. Rideout, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 328 S.E.2d 783 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Per Capita Distribution.
   
   - This chapter calls for a per capita distribution of the decedent's real and personal property to all surviving persons in the same degree of relationship to the decedent. The distribution scheme is commonly referred to as "per capita at each generation." Rawls v. Rideout, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 328 S.E.2d 783 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wrongful Death Action.
   
   - In a wrongful death action, the real parties in interest were the beneficiaries as defined in the Wrongful Death Act, who were the same persons who would have received property had the decedent died intestate; where a widow, who was the decedent's sole intestate beneficiary, had abandoned the decedent before his death, she was not entitled to a wrongful death recovery, and since the remaining beneficiaries did not succeed to a full 100 percent, but only received their original percentage, there were no beneficiaries to the wrongful death claim. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 571 S.E.2d 668 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 673</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 272 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where decedent's ex-spouse abandoned her interest in the decedent's estate at the time of death, decedent's siblings were entitled to share in any wrongful death proceeds, distribution was dictated by the laws of intestacy, and decedent's sister, as administratrix had standing to file the action. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 113</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 543 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiff father, having abandoned the deceased when the latter was a minor child,
   
   could not share in the proceeds of the settlement of the claim for wrongful death now in the hands of the administratrix. Williford v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 506</cite>, 219 S.E.2d 220 (1975).

       Putative Child Not Heir
   
   - Putative child was not the child's putative father's heir because strict compliance, not substantial compliance, with the procedures in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)(2)</a></cite> was required to establish an illegitimate child as a legal heir, and the statute was not strictly complied with when the father's affidavit of paternity was not filed with the clerk.

       When a gift is made to a class of "heirs," the intestacy laws govern
   
   not only the identification of the "heirs," but also the shares to which they are entitled. Rawls v. Rideout, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 328 S.E.2d 783 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Per Capita Distribution.
   
   - This chapter calls for a per capita distribution of the decedent's real and personal property to all surviving persons in the same degree of relationship to the decedent. The distribution scheme is commonly referred to as "per capita at each generation." Rawls v. Rideout, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 328 S.E.2d 783 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no logical reason for the Court of Appeals to favor a per capita distribution over a per stirpes distribution absent the intent of the testatrix as ascertained from the four corners of the will. Lewis v. Ecklin, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 73, 428 S.E.2d 855 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Not Function of Administrator to Partition Real Estate.
   
   - It is the duty of the administrator to make distribution of the surplus of his intestate's personal property among those entitled thereto, but it is not his function to partition the real estate of his decedent among the heirs. King v. Neese, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 132</cite>, 63 S.E.2d 123 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Siblings.
   
   - Where decedent's ex-spouse abandoned her interest in the decedent's estate at the time of death, decedent's siblings were entitled to share in any wrongful death proceeds, distribution was dictated by the laws of intestacy, and decedent's sister, as administratrix had standing to file the action. Locust v. Pitt County Mem'l Hosp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 113</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 543 (2004).

       North Carolina recognizes the doctrine of equitable adoption.
   
   Lankford v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 115</cite>, 489 S.E.2d 604 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       Equitable adoption, does not confer the incidents of formal statutory adoption; rather, it merely confers rights of inheritance upon the foster child in the event of intestacy of the foster parents. Lankford v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 115</cite>, 489 S.E.2d 604 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "lineal descendants"
   
   is defined at <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-2" target="_self">G.S. 29-2(4)</a></cite> as "all children of such person"; this would include even illegitimate children of a deceased female, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(a)</a></cite>, and clearly includes adopted children, under this section. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of subsection (e)
   
   of this section is to make it clear that the relationship of parent and child is not severed when the child is adopted by the spouse of the biological parent. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Rights of Adopted Child Same as for Natural Child.
   
   - The legislature has provided that an adopted child from the date of its adoption shall have the same property rights as a natural born child from the date of its birth. Headen v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 157</cite>, 120 S.E.2d 598 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any provision of law which prevented an adopted child from sharing in property, by descent or distribution in the same manner and to the same extent as a natural born child, was swept away by the repealing clause in chapter 813, Session Laws of 1955. Headen v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 157</cite>, 120 S.E.2d 598 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       An adopted child shall be entitled to inherit property by, through, and from his adoptive parents as if he were born the legitimate child of the adoptive parents. Greenlee v. Quinn, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 601</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 409 (1961).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of an adopted child to inherit vests as of death of her adoptive parent,
   
   and therefore where the parent died prior to the effective date of an act creating a new rule of descent and of distribution the act is not applicable. Wilson v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 521</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 447 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Inheritance from Brother of Adopting Parent.
   
   - Under the provisions of Session Laws 1955, c. 813, s. 6, an adopted child was entitled to inherit property from the brother of the adopting parent, notwithstanding that the decree of adoption was entered prior to the passage of the statute, the legislature having the power to determine who shall take the property of a person dying subsequent to the effective date of a legislative act. Bennett v. Cain, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 428</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 510 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Has No Bearing upon Whether Adopted Child Takes under Will.
   
   - The statutes relating to the right of adopted children to take as distributees and heirs have no bearing upon whether an adopted child takes under a will, except insofar as they establish and define the parent and child relationship between the adoptive parents and the adopted child. Bradford v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 572</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 632 (1953).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Biological Parent Need Not Join in Spouse's Petition for Adoption of Children.
   
   - Subsection (e) of this section and G.S. 48-7(d) were enacted, not to retain adopted children's status as "lineal descendants" by the former marriage, but instead to provide that the parent-child relationship between adopted children and their biological parent is not severed by the parent's spouse's adoption of her children from a former marriage. Since the relationship remains intact in this limited situation, it is not necessary for such a biological parent to become a co-petitioner in her husband's adoption of her legitimate children of a former marriage. This biological parent, however, must consent to the adoption, as must any biological parent who does not come within the ambit of G.S. 48-6. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife's failure to "join" in her husband's petition for the adoption of her two minor children by a previous marriage in no way affected her relationship with the children and was immaterial to a determination of her husband's distributive share under former G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).

       Statute Does Not Violate Equal Protection or Due Process Clauses.
   
   - This section and the statutes in pari materia are substantially related to the lawful State interests.

       <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)(2)</a></cite> did not violate equal protection as applied to a deceased father's illegitimate putative child because the statute furthered the state's legitimate permissive interest in the just and orderly disposition of property at death.

      </p>
      <p>
       In General.
   
   - Illegitimate children may inherit from their putative fathers if they have been legitimated by one of the methods established in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.049.html#t49a02s49-10" target="_blank">G.S. 49-10</a></cite> through 49-14, or if paternity has been established in an action for criminal nonsupport. Helms v. Young-Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 746, 411 S.E.2d 184 (1991), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 117</cite>, 414 S.E.2d 756, 506 U.S. 829, 113 S. Ct. 91, 121 L. Ed. 2d 53 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (b)(1) is constitutional
   
   on its face. Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of subdivision (b)(1) to decedent's estate was not unconstitutional on grounds that decedent was not represented by counsel when he was adjudged the father of plaintiff's illegitimate children. Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Different Treatment of Mother and Father Not Unconstitutional.
   
   - While this section classifies the illegitimate's mother and her heirs and the putative father and his heirs differently by placing the additional requirement on the father to establish his paternity by one of the statutorily prescribed methods before he is permitted to inherit, this classification is substantially related to permissible State interests. This section does not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV in this regard. Estate of Stern v. Stern, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 311 S.E.2d 909 (1984), appeal dismissed, 471 U.S. 1011, 105 S. Ct. 2010, 85 L. Ed. 2d 294 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest of State in Inheritance Rights of Illegitimate Children.
   
   - By specifying the manner and time in which an illegitimate may establish his paternity, this State has sought (1) to mitigate the hardships created by former law (which permitted illegitimates to inherit only from the mother and from each other); (2) to equalize insofar as practical the inheritance rights of legitimate and illegitimate children; and, (3) at the same time to safeguard the just and orderly disposition of a decedent's property and the dependability of titles passing under intestate laws. Mitchell v. Freuler, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 206</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 762 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section and the other statutes referred to herein (G.S. 49-14 through 49-16), insofar as they provide that an illegitimate child may inherit from its father only if paternity has been acknowledged in writing or finally adjudged in the lifetime of the father and otherwise in accord with those applicable statutes, establish a statutory scheme which bears an evident and substantial relation to the permissible and important interest of the State in providing for the just and orderly disposition of property at death. Outlaw v. Planters Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 571, 255 S.E.2d 189 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Interest of State in Inheritance by Father from Illegitimate Child.
   
   - The requirement imposed on the father of an illegitimate who would inherit from his illegitimate child is substantially related to the important State interests that this section is intended to promote. Estate of Stern v. Stern, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 311 S.E.2d 909 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Birth certification amendment application form did not meet requirements of subsection (b)
   
   where it contained no statement by the putative father or anyone else that he was the father of the child, and even if his signature in the blank space involved could be construed to be an unambiguous acknowledgment of paternity, he did not swear to it before any official authorized to administer oaths. In re Will of Bunch, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 463, 358 S.E.2d 118 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "lineal descendants"
   
   is defined at <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a01s29-2" target="_self">G.S. 29-2(4)</a></cite> as "all children of such person"; this would include even illegitimate children of a deceased female, under subsection (a) of this section, and clearly includes adopted children, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a04s29-17" target="_self">G.S. 29-17</a></cite>. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to Inherit Established upon Adjudication of Paternity.
   
   - Once plaintiffs satisfied the notice requirement of this section, and showed that decedent had been adjudged their father under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.049.html#t49a01s49-1" target="_blank">G.S. 49-1</a></cite> through 49-9, their right to inherit was established as a matter of law; it did not depend upon a declaration in a court order or judgment. Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       A putative father and his kindred are only entitled to inherit from an illegitimate child if paternity has been established by one of the methods prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>. In re Estate of Morris, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 264, 472 S.E.2d 786 (1996).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Acknowledgment Not Filed.
   
   - Where petitioner acknowledged his paternity before a notary public and executed the "Affidavit Of Parentage For Child Born Out Of Wedlock" but never filed the acknowledgment with the clerk of court, he did not fulfill all the requirements under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>. In re Estate of Morris, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 264, 472 S.E.2d 786 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Putative child was not the child's putative father's heir because strict compliance, not substantial compliance, with the procedures in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)(2)</a></cite> was required to establish an illegitimate child as a legal heir, and the statute was not strictly complied with when the father's affidavit of paternity was not filed with the clerk. In re Estate of Williams, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 76, 783 S.E.2d 253 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Compliance with Section Essential.
   
   - Where there has been no compliance with this section, illegitimate child has no right to inherit from deceased putative father. Hayes v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 348 S.E.2d 609 (1986), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 224</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 402, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 824, 108 S. Ct. 88, 98 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       Illegitimate child's complaint seeking a declaration that she was the sole heir of a decedent was properly dismissed where the complaint did not claim that the decedent was adjudged to be the child's father, or that the decedent had acknowledged himself to be the child's father in a written instrument which was duly executed and filed; absent <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>, an illegitimate child had no right to inherit from his or her putative father, and, although a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) test had established that the decedent was the child's biological father, a positive DNA test was not listed in the statute as a method of meeting the requirements to legitimate a child. Phillips v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 590 S.E.2d 280, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 377</cite>, 597 S.E.2d 133 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk of court did not err in finding that claimants failed to show compliance with any of the four forms of legitimation necessary for illegitimate children to inherit from or through their putative fathers because they did not fulfill the statutory requirements for establishing legitimation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>; four legitimation methods available in North Carolina were a verified petition filed with a court, the marriage of the mother and putative father, a civil action to establish paternity, or an action for criminal nonsupport. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 701 S.E.2d 399 (2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plea of Guilty in Bastardy Action as Basis for Inheritance by Child.
   
   - An illegitimate child may inherit, through intestate succession, from the estate of a father who acknowledged paternity to the child by pleading guilty in a criminal bastardy action. Sanders v. Brantley, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 797, 323 S.E.2d 426 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice under Subsection (b) as Condition Precedent.
   
   - The requirement of subsection (b) that illegitimate children give written notice of their claims of inheritance to the personal representatives of their putative fathers' estates within six months after the first publication or posting of general notice to creditors is a condition precedent to an illegitimate child's right to receive a distribution from the estate of a father who meets the description in subdivision (1) or (2) of subsection (b). Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Form of Notice.
   
   - Subsection (b) does not specify any particular form the notice required of illegitimate children must take. Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiffs' verified complaint seeking revocation of defendant's letters, which fully alleged the basis of their claim of entitlement to inherit from decedent and was received by defendant, as personal representative of the estate, within the statutory period for notice, satisfied the notice requirement of subsection (b) of this section. Estate of Lucas v. Jarrett, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 284 S.E.2d 711 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The formalities of subdivision (b)(2) of this section serve a dual purpose.
   
   - As a method for establishing paternity, a written instrument acknowledging paternity, executed and filed with the clerk of superior court, assures the requisite degree of certainty. The formalities further assure that the decedent intended that the illegitimate child share in his estate, much in the same way that a father intentionally excludes legitimate children as beneficiaries under his will. Herndon v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 291 S.E.2d 305, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Documents Inadequate under Subdivision (b)(2).
   
   - Plaintiff's proof of numerous written documents, signed by his putative father, which clearly acknowledged paternity, did not rise to the dignity of constructive compliance with subdivision (b)(2) of this section, where the documents were offered for purposes other than to establish paternity as contemplated under subdivision (b)(2). Herndon v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 291 S.E.2d 305, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Voluntary Support Agreement Used to Establish Right to Inherit.
   
   - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132</a></cite> does not imply that voluntary support agreements are strictly limited such that they may have no legal implications other than that of child support; it acknowledges that voluntary support agreements, when properly acknowledged and approved by a trial court, have the same force and effect as a trial court's order of support. Accordingly, a voluntary support agreement could be used to establish that an out-of-wedlock child was entitled to inherit under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>. In re Estate of Potts, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 651 S.E.2d 297 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decedent's out-of-wedlock child was entitled to inherit under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 29-19(b)(2)</a></cite>. The decedent had acknowledged in a voluntary support agreement that he was the child's father; the agreement was executed by a notary, who was a certifying officer; and it was filed during both the decedent's and the child's lifetimes with the clerk of superior court in the decedent's county. In re Estate of Potts, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 651 S.E.2d 297 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action by Father Required to Include Illegitimate Child.
   
   - Just as a father must act to exclude a legitimate child from sharing in his estate, he must also act to include an illegitimate child. The distinction is an important one. Herndon v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 291 S.E.2d 305, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 557</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 223 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability of Subsection (d).
   
   - Subsection (d) of this section is clear in its meaning and applies only when the child is taking under a will from the putative father and not when the putative father or his heirs are attempting to inherit from the child under the intestacy statutes. Estate of Stern v. Stern, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 311 S.E.2d 909 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Inheritance from Father Prior to 1973 Amendment.
   
   - See Jolly v. Queen, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 711</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 592 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section confers upon illegitimate children same rights enjoyed by legitimate children under laws of intestate succession
   
   once there is proper adjudication or acknowledgment of paternity. Notification of the personal representative within six months of published notice to creditors does not establish or define the illegitimate child's right, but merely sets a time limitation for an illegitimate child to seek its enforcement. Jefferys v. Tolin, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 368 S.E.2d 201 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) is Statute of Limitation.
   
   - The six-month limitation period in subsection (b), relating to notice of the claim of an illegitimate child to take from father's estate, is a statute of limitation which is subject to being tolled under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa03s1-17" target="_blank">G.S. 1-17</a></cite>. Jefferys v. Tolin, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 368 S.E.2d 201 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Father's Right to Inherit from Illegitimate Child Established.
   
   - Because a father acknowledged himself to be his daughter's father in a parenting agreement filed in the county where the mother and daughter were residents and because the agreement was acknowledged by all parties and approved by a district court judge, the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a06s29-19" target="_self">G.S. 29-19</a></cite> were followed and the father was an heir of the daughter's estate. In re Estate of Mangum, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 713 S.E.2d 18 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Paternity Established.
   
   - By presenting a DNA test, plaintiff established the decedent's paternity at a probability of 99.99%. Because there was no evidence in the record contradicting the evidence offered by plaintiff, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment on plaintiff's paternity claim. Swint v. Doe, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 827 S.E.2d 309 (2019).

        Section Preserves Benefits of Dower and Curtesy.
   
   - Dower, as such, has been abolished in North Carolina, but this section preserves to a surviving spouse the benefits of the former rights of dower and curtesy. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965); Heller v. Heller, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 171 S.E.2d 335 (1969); Taylor v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 271 S.E.2d 296 (1980), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 274 S.E.2d 235 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has the practical effect of providing the benefits of dower to the surviving spouse, at her election. Peoples Oil Co. v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 696</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 369 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        To protect the rights of dower or curtesy, the General Assembly has prescribed regulations and limitations on the right of a married person to convey his or her real property free from the elective life estate provided for his or her spouse by this section. Heller v. Heller, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 171 S.E.2d 335 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section limits the right of a married person to convey his or her real property
   
   free from the elective life estate provided by this section. Taylor v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 271 S.E.2d 296 (1980), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 274 S.E.2d 235 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose.
   
   - The reason for granting the surviving spouse an election or choice is to prevent such spouse from being rendered penniless and turned out of doors by reason of a small net estate or an insolvent estate. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        A surviving spouse is given this election so as not to be rendered penniless and would elect this option when the estate is small or insolvent. Taylor v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 271 S.E.2d 296 (1980), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 274 S.E.2d 235 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in admitting the testimony of the brother's wife about conversations she had with decedent, and about conversations she overheard between decedent and the brother; since the wife was an interested party because she stood to inherit the property the brother was seeking if his specific performance action to enforce decedent's contract to make a will in the brother's favor was resolved in the brother's favor, she was barred from testifying about what a dead man had said in that regard. Taylor v. Abernethy, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 620 S.E.2d 242 (2005), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 367</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 454 (2006).

   - A wife is not a real party in interest so as to interpose as a defense or counterclaim in an action in ejectment instituted by her husband's grantee that her husband had fraudulently conveyed the lands without her joinder in order to deprive her of the possession thereof, since <cite class="octn"><a href="#t29a02s29-14" target="_self">G.S. 29-14</a></cite>, defining the share of the surviving spouse of an intestate, and this section, providing for a life estate at the election of the surviving spouse, do not give her a present right of possession.

        Effect of Inchoate Dower Interest.
   
   - An inchoate dower interest is not an estate in land nor a vested interest, but, nevertheless, it acts as an encumbrance upon real property. Taylor v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 271 S.E.2d 296 (1980), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 274 S.E.2d 235 (1981).

        Different Time Limits Are Fixed to Give Surviving Spouse Opportunity to Decide.
   
   - The reason different time limits are fixed for making the election, under the different circumstances, as set out in subsection (c), subdivisions (1), (2), (3) and (4), is to give the surviving spouse ample opportunity to make a decision as to which choice is most beneficial. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).

        Spouse Would Elect Life Estate Where Estate Is Insolvent.
   
   - A surviving spouse would certainly elect to take a life estate where it would require a sale of all of the property of deceased's estate to pay the debts. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).

         Inchoate Right to Dower May Be Protected by Redemption from Tax Sale.

        - A wife who claims in property an inchoate right to dower is possessed of such an interest that she clearly has the right to protect such interest by redeeming such property from a tax sale. Samet v. United States, 242 F. Supp. 214 (M.D.N.C. 1965).

         II. PENDING LITIGATION.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subdivision (c)(4) Authorizes Fixing of Time for Election Where Litigation Is Pending.
   
   - Subdivision (c)(4) contemplates that the outcome of the litigation may well determine whether the surviving spouse will elect to take a life estate. Therefore, it authorizes the surviving spouse, if such litigation is pending, to request of the clerk a written order allowing a reasonable time within which the notice of election and the proceedings pursuant thereto may be filed and instituted. Upon such request, it becomes the duty of the clerk forthwith to make a written order fixing a time within which an election may be filed in accordance with subsection (c). Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Share" under Subdivision (c)(4) Means Any Share Spouse Is Entitled to.
   
   - As used in subdivision (c)(4), "share" means such share in the estate (not necessarily the net estate or property) as the surviving spouse shall be entitled to take by any provision of this Chapter. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Any Litigation Affecting Spouse's Choice Affects Such Share.
   
   - Any litigation which may substantially and materially affect the choice the surviving spouse is entitled to make "affects the share of the surviving spouse in the estate" under subdivision (c)(4). Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Such as Suit on Disputed Claim Large Enough to Render Estate Insolvent.
   
   - If there is a disputed claim which, if allowed, would render the estate insolvent or nearly so, and which, if disallowed, would leave a large net estate, the outcome of the suit on the claim would affect the share of the surviving spouse and might well determine the matter of election, though the subject of the litigation is a mere debt and not the title to land. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suit to Set Aside Deed from Son to Surviving Spouse of His Interest in Estate.
   
   - Where, before the time limit for making an election, as provided in subdivision (c)(3), had expired, a son instituted litigation to set aside a deed to his mother of his interest in his deceased father's lands, on the ground that she had defrauded him, the outcome of the litigation would affect her choice or election, i.e., her share of the estate. The pendency of the litigation extended her time for making the election. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Action by Widow Not "Pending" Litigation.
   
   - An action by the widow, commenced after time for election had expired, to declare void a deed executed by her husband which conveyed the husband's separate realty to his children of a prior marriage, does not constitute "pending" litigation within the meaning of subdivision (c)(4) of this section. Heller v. Heller, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 171 S.E.2d 335 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time Allowed Should Be Reasonable Time after Litigation Ends.
   
   - The time allowed under subdivision (c)(4) should be such time after the termination of the pending litigation as to the clerk, in the exercise of his sound discretion, seems reasonable under the circumstances. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Twenty Days Is Not Unreasonable.
   
   - Twenty days allowed under subdivision (c)(4) by the clerk for filing notice of election and issuing of summons is not unreasonable. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The order fixing the time limit under subdivision (c)(4) must be made forthwith
   
   upon the ex parte request of the surviving spouse. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Such Order Is Only Ministerial.
   
   - The written order under subdivision (c)(4) is only ministerial, it merely fixes the time limit, and it is not an adjudication of any issues or questions of law which may be raised in the proceeding between the surviving spouse and other interested parties. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Rights of Parties Are Not Determined Until Later.
   
   - The rights of the parties are determined after notice of election has been filed pursuant to the order fixing the time limit, summons served and the pleadings are in. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedure is in Accordance with Rules Relating to Partition.
   
   - Proceedings determining the rights of the parties and allotting the life estate are in accordance with the rules of procedure relating to partition of lands as far as practicable. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 18</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 300 (1965).
