       Elective Share. - The surviving spouse of a decedent who dies domiciled in this State has a right to claim an "elective share", which means an amount equal to (i) the applicable share of the Total Net Assets, as defined in G.S. 30-3.2(4), less (ii) the value of Net Property Passing to Surviving Spouse, as defined in G.S. 30-3.2(2c). The applicable share of the Total Net Assets is as follows:

        <li id="t30a1As30-3.1ol1a1">
         If the surviving spouse was married to the decedent for less than five years, fifteen percent (15%) of the Total Net Assets.

       <p>
        Waiver In Pre-Marital Agreement.
   
   - Decedent's widow was not entitled to an elective share of the decedent's estate because the express language of the parties' pre-marital agreement showed the widow voluntarily waived any right to claim a spousal elective share of the decedent's separate property, and stated the agreement was binding upon and inured to the benefit of the parties and the parties' respective heirs, executors, personal representatives, successors, and assigns, refuting any contention that the widow intended to retain any rights in the husband's estate. In re Estate of Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 814 S.E.2d 595 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reconciliation After Separation Agreement.
   
   - During a separation, the surviving spouse and the decedent prepared a separation agreement containing a provision wherein they waived the right to inheritance rights from each others' estates, but the couple thereafter reconciled and lived together until the decedent's death; thus, the surviving spouse had a right to claim an elective share under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a1As30-3.1" target="_self">G.S. 30-3.1</a></cite> because the waiver of inheritance rights was rescinded and canceled under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-10.2" target="_blank">G.S. 52-10.2</a></cite> by the reconciliation of the decedent and the surviving spouse. In re Estate of Archibald, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 644 S.E.2d 264 (2007).
   <br />

     The cases below were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> to 30-3 and corresponding prior provisions, relating to the right to dissent.

       <p>
        Constitutionality of Former Provisions.
   
   - The provisions of, former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, G.S. 30-2, and G.S. 30-3, insofar as they gave a husband a right in certain cases to dissent from his deceased wife's will, and to take a specified share of his deceased wife's real and personal property, violated the former provisions of N.C. Const., Art. X,
   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   6 (see now N.C. Const., Art. X,
   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   4), since they diminished a married woman's estate disposed of by her will, and restricted and abridged her constitutional power to dispose of her property by will as if she were unmarried. Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 590 (1962), commented on in 41 N.C.L. Rev. 311 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, G.S. 30-2, and G.S. 30-3, insofar as they gave a husband the right in certain instances to dissent from his deceased wife's will and take a specified share of her estate, were unconstitutional under former N.C.

   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   6 (see now N.C. Const., Art. X,
   <span class="s2">
    §

   <span class="s2">
    §
   </span>
   6 (see now N.C. Const., Art. X,
   <span class="s2">
    §

   4), restored, subject to the qualifications set forth in Session Laws 1963, c. 1209, the right of the husband to dissent from the will of his wife. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967); Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former G.S. 30-3(b), which provided that a second or successive spouse who dissented from the will of his deceased spouse should take only one half the amount provided by the Intestate Succession Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-1" target="_blank">G.S. 29-1</a></cite> et seq., for the surviving spouse if the testator had surviving him lineal descendants by a former marriage but there were no surviving lineal descendants by the second or successive marriage, was not arbitrarily discriminatory and capricious so as to be violative of the due process provisions of the federal and State Constitutions. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>

   to the defendant's right to dissent; because former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 30-1(c)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-254" target="_blank">G.S. 1-254</a></cite> govern mutually exclusive subject matter, each must be construed separately; although both an action contesting a surviving spouse's right of dissent and an action construing a will in part involve estate valuations (the dissent action involving valuation of the entire estate and the declaratory judgment action involving valuation of the testamentary estate), the actions are still fundamentally different in nature.

        Purpose of Statute.
   
   - The apparent purpose of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> to deny a surviving spouse a share of the testator's "net estate" when he or she had been adequately provided for by property passing outside the probate estate.

       <p>
        Right Conferred by Statute.
   
   - The right of a husband or wife to dissent from the will of his spouse was conferred by statute and could be under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> exercised at the time and in the manner fixed by statute.

   - The surving spouse in the exercise of the right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> was not required to assign any reason therefor.

        Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> conferred no right of dower or year's support;

       <p>
        Rights Analogous to Former Right of Dower.
   
   - The rights devolving after the allocation by the commissioners of the spouse's share after a dissent (claim of elective share) is analogous to the rights which devolved upon a widow in the allocation of her dower before its abolishment. Etheridge v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 255 S.E.2d 729 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 735</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 660 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitation on Right.
   
   - Right to dissert under former provisions was limited to those cases in which provisions under the will, when added to the value of property passing outside the will as a result of the testator's death, (1) were less than the intestate share, or (2) were less than one half of the net estate if neither lineal descendant nor parent survived. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 384</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 573 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Not an Obligation.
   
   - The right to dissent was not an obligation to dissent. Moveover, it was a common principle of law that a surviving spouse had to elect between taking under a will and dissenting from the will, and the election of one precluded the other. Tarlton v. Stidham, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 469 S.E.2d 38 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Not Contingent.
   
   - Although under prior law the right to take property after dissenting from a will must be established, it was not a contingent right. Tighe v. Michal, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 254 S.E.2d 538 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Testator Presumed to Have Known of Surviving Spouse's Right.
   
   - In making a will a husband is presumed to have knowledge of and to have taken into consideration the statutory right of his widow under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> to dissent from the will. Keesler v. North Carolina Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 12</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 807 (1961); Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Testator can prevent his will from being upset
   
   by giving his surviving spouse the minimum provision required by statute, which may be satisfied in whole or in part by a life estate or life income interest. In re Estate of Finch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 389 S.E.2d 126 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Election Required under Prior Statutes.
   
   - Under prior statutes, surviving spouse had to elect between taking under a will and dissenting from the will. The spouse could not do both; the election of one precludes the other. Hill v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 277 S.E.2d 542, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 543</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 392 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dissenting Widow Could Not Assert Any Benefits under Will.
   
   - Widow's dissent from her husband's will under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> et seq. was a rejection of it as far as her rights were concerned, and having elected to treat it as a nullity, she could not assert any benefits thereunder, even in regard to direction in the will for the payment of estate taxes. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 654</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 879 (1953), commented on in 31 N.C.L. Rev. 491 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The act of qualifying as administratrix c.t.a. did not constitute an election
   
   to take under the will so as to bar the statutory right of dissent under prior statutes, when at the time of qualification as administratrix c.t.a., the widow was 69 years old, had not communicated with her deceased husband for 18 years, was not accomplished in business affairs on the administration of estates and did not have the assistance of legal counsel. Hurdle v. Sawyer, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 814, 266 S.E.2d 404 (1980).

       <p>
        Effect of Dissent on Provisions of Will.
   
   - A widow having dissented from her husband's will under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> et seq. was entitled to exactly the same share in his estate she would have received if he had died intestate. So far as her property rights in her husband's estate were concerned there was no will. In all other respects the will remained and the executors were controlled by its terms. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 654</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 879 (1953), commented on in 31 N.C.L. Rev. 491 (1953).
   <br />

       <p>
        Dissent Held to Bar Other Actions.
   
   - Plaintiff's dissent to her husband's will, under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, which was subject only to an essentially ministerial act by the clerk of court in approving a valuation agreement, precluded her from maintaining an action for construction of the will or claiming property passing under the residuary clause of the will. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 357</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 506 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect on Remainder.
   
   - Widow's dissent from will under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> et seq. was held to terminate her life estate thereunder and accelerate the vesting of remainder. Union Nat'l Bank v. Easterby, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 599</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 541 (1952).

        Dissent of surviving spouse, so far as remaindermen are concerned, is equivalent to her death. Keesler v. North Carolina Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 12</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 807 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Separate Agreement with Remaindermen.
   
   - The fact that widow's unconditional dissent from will under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a1As30-3.1" target="_self">G.S. 30-3.1</a></cite> and election to take her statutory rights was based upon separate agreement with the vested remaindermen that they pay her a specified sum, did not affect the validity of the dissent, the dissent being valid unless she was induced to dissent in ignorance of her rights to her prejudice. Union Nat'l Bank v. Easterby, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 599</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 541 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Personal Representative Who Was Surviving Spouse Need Not Resign While Right Is Determined.
   
   - The personal representative need not resign from that position during the time the right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> was being determined. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 384</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 573 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Resign Is Not Waiver of Right.
   
   - The failure of the surviving spouse to resign as personal representative during the time the right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> was determined could not constitute a waiver of the right. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 384</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 573 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of Widow Who Offered Will and Was Appointed Executrix.
   
   - Under prior statutes, widow who offered a will for probate and qualified as executrix thereunder, and entered upon the duties of her office, or knowingly took property thereunder, could not afterwards be allowed to resign and dissent from said will, unless it appeared that such widow was at the time mentally and physically disqualified from attending to the business in hand or having any intelligent concept of what she was about.

       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "lineal descendants" is generally applied not to distinguish between children of various marriages or out of wedlock, but to distinguish children from other collateral descendants, e.g., nieces and nephews. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Adopted Children as Lineal Descendants.
   
   - Natural children of one spouse born during a previous marriage, if adopted by second spouse with the consent of their surviving natural parent, would be considered lineal descendants by the second marriage for the purposes of former G.S. 30-3(b), which determined a dissenting spouse's share. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applying G.S. 48-23(1), children adopted must be treated legally as having been born at the time of the order of adoption; accordingly, children in question were as a matter of law born of decedent's second marriage, and were "lineal descendants by the second marriage" within the intended meaning of former G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The natural children of a testatrix, born of a previous marriage and duly adopted by her second husband, would be considered to be her lineal descendants by the second marriage for purposes of determining the second spouse's distributive share upon his dissent from the testatrix's will pursuant to former G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).

        More Testamentary Freedom Allowed to Spouse with Lineal Descendants by First Marriage Only.
   
   - The real effect of former G.S. 30-3 was to allow a spouse who left a child or other lineal descendant by a previous marriage but none by the spouse who survived him more testamentary freedom than he would have had otherwise. It was not for the Court of Appeals to "second guess" the General Assembly on the wisdom of this distinction. The court believed the statute was enacted in good faith and it created a classification based upon real distinctions which were not unreasonable. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 164 S.E.2d 631 (1968), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).

       <p>
        Establishment of Right When Spouse and Lineal Descendant Survive.
   
   - Under prior statutes where the testator was survived by his spouse and a lineal descendant, the right of the surviving spouse to dissent was established by the determination and comparison of two figures: (1) the aggregate value of property passing under the will and outside the will to the surviving spouse: and (2) the intestate share of the surviving spouse. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 238 S.E.2d 790 (1977), , <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

        Intent of the legislature
   
   in enacting former G.S. 30-3(b) was to enable a person who had a child or lineal descendant by a former marriage to make greater provision for such child or lineal descendant. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the legislative purpose of former G.S. 30-3(b) was not entirely clear, it was apparently passed to protect a testator's children by a former marriage against a "fortune-hunting" second or successive spouse.

        Former G.S. 30-3(b) was enacted for the protection of a testator's children by a former spouse, on the assumption that a second or successive spouse would not feel as compelled to provide for the stepchildren upon testator's death as would the testator in his will. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Former G.S. 30-3(b) was Applicable.
   
   - Former G.S. 30-3(b) was applicable when the decedent was survived by a child or lineal descendant of a former marriage, even if the decedent's will left nothing to such child or lineal descendant. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former G.S. 30-3(b) applied to limit the share of a surviving spouse to one half the intestate share only when (1) a married person died testate survived by his spouse, (2) the surviving spouse, being entitled under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> to do so, dissented, (3) the surviving spouse was a "second or successive spouse," (4) no lineal descendants by the second or successive marriage survived the testator, and (5) the testator was survived by lineal descendants by his former marriage. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Facts Not Considered as to Applicability of Former G.S. 30-3(b).
   
   - Whether former G.S. 30-3(b) applied did not depend at all upon such considerations as: (1) the comparative durations of the first and second marriage; (2) whether the former marriage was terminated by death or by divorce; (3) the age(s) of the child or children of the former marriage at the time of the second or successive marriage; and (4) the age(s) of the child or children of the former marriage and their financial status at the time of the death of the decedent. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife's failure to "join" in her husband's petition for adoption of her two minor children
   
   by a previous marriage in no way affected her relationship with the children and was immaterial to a determination of her husband's distributive share under former G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).

        For purposes of determining whether a surviving spouse could dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, it was an estimation of the federal estate tax which had to be deducted in approximating the "net estate."

      For purposes of this sub-subdivision, the termination of a right or interest in, or power over, property that would have been included in the total assets under sub-subdivisions b., e., or f. of this subdivision if the right, interest, or power had not terminated until the decedent's death shall be deemed to be a transfer of such property. Termination occurs when, with respect to a right or interest in property, the decedent transfers or relinquishes the right or interest; with respect to a power over property, the power terminates by exercise or release, but not by lapse or default.
     </p>
     <p>
      If property falls under more than one sub-subdivision of this subdivision, then the property shall be included only once, but under the sub-subdivision yielding the greatest value of the property.

        Trust Not Part of Total Net Assets.
   
   - Superior court did not err in denying a widow's claim for an elective share because the assets in a decedent's trust were not part of his total net assets; the trust assets were part of the decedent's gross estate, and no value was left in the trust for purposes of calculating the decedent's total net assets because the taxable estate was zero since the assets of the trust were all transferred to a corporation organized for a charitable purpose. Pope v. Rollins (In re Estate of Pope), <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 666 S.E.2d 140 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 126</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 129 (2009).

        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite> Governs Intestate Share.
   
   - The determination of a surviving spouse's intestate share is governed in the first instance by the "Intestate Succession Act," <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-1" target="_blank">G.S. 29-1</a></cite> et seq.

       </p>
       <p>
        "Intestate share," as used in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, means the amount of real and personal property that the surviving spouse would receive under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-1" target="_blank">G.S. 29-1</a></cite> et seq., known as the Intestate Succession Act, if her husband had died intestate.

   The fact that the legislature provided one criterion for determining whether the right to dissent existed and another for determining the consequences of the dissent created no ambiguity. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

        Term Would Not Be Defined with References to Consequences of Dissent.
   
   - The 1975 amendment which added subdivision (a)(3) of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, cases where the surviving spouse is a second or successive spouse and the testator has surviving him lineal descendants by a former marriage and there are no lineal descendants surviving him by the second or successive marriage, did not manifest that the General Assembly's intent that the term "intestate share" in subdivision (a)(1) of the section be defined with reference to the consequences of the dissent. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

   - The year's allowance for the surviving spouse under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a04s30-15" target="_self">G.S. 30-15</a></cite> is not a part of the "intestate share" passing to a surviving spouse under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-1" target="_blank">G.S. 29-1</a></cite> et seq., known as the Intestate Succession Act.

        Nor Is Entirety Property, Insurance, or Joint Accounts with Survivorship.

       Basic Principles. - Unless otherwise expressly stated to the contrary in this section, the value of property shall be that property's fair market value, taking into consideration any applicable discounts. The value shall be determined as of the date of death, except for (i) property transferred to persons other than the surviving spouse described in G.S. 30-3.2(3f)g. and (ii) property transferred to the surviving spouse described in G.S. 30-3.2(3c)e. that is not held in trust, that is not life insurance, and that is not held as tenants by the entirety or some other form of ownership that passes to the surviving spouse by reason of survivorship. The value of gift property described in clauses (i) and (ii) shall be determined as the value on the date of transfer; but if the donee proves to the satisfaction of the clerk that the value on the date of disposal of the asset prior to the decedent's death is less than on the original date of transfer or that the value on the date of death is less than on the original date of transfer, then the lesser value shall be used.
      </li>
      <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1b">
       Certain Joint Property. - In valuing a partial interest in jointly owned property with right of survivorship, there shall be no discount taken to reflect the decedent's partial interest including, but not limited to, discounts for lack of control, ownership of a fractional interest, or lack of marketability.
      </li>
      <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1c">
       Certain Powers of Appointment. - In valuing property over which the decedent held a presently exercisable general power of appointment, the value includes only the property subject to the power that passes at the decedent's death, whether by exercise, release, lapse, default, or otherwise.
      </li>
      <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1d">
       Certain Transfers With Retained Interests. - In valuing property transferred by the decedent with a retained right of possession or enjoyment or the right to income described in G.S. 30-3.2(3f)e., only the fraction of the property to which the decedent retained a right shall be included. In valuing property in which the decedent created a power as described in G.S. 30-3.2(3f)f., the value includes, with respect to a power, the value of the property subject to the power, and the amount included in the valuation with respect to a power over the income is the value of the property that produces or produced the income; provided, however, if the power is a power over both income and property and the foregoing produces different amounts, the amount included in the valuation is the greater amount.
      </li>
      <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1e">
       Partial or Contingent Interest Property. - The valuation of partial and contingent property interests, outright or in trust, which are limited to commence or terminate upon the death of one or more persons, upon the expiration of a period of time, or upon the occurrence of one or more contingencies, shall be determined by computations based upon the mortality and annuity tables set forth in G.S. 8-46 and G.S. 8-47, and by using a presumed rate of return of six percent (6%) of the value of the underlying property in which those interests are limited, unless upon good cause shown by one of the parties, the clerk determines that the use of such tables or rate of return is not appropriate, then the value of such interests shall be determined under subsection (f) of this section. However, in valuing partial and contingent interests passing to the surviving spouse, the following special rules apply:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1e1">
         The value of the beneficial interest of a spouse shall be the entire fair market value of any property held in trust if the decedent was the settlor of the trust, if the trust is held for the exclusive benefit of the surviving spouse during the surviving spouse's lifetime, and if the terms of the trust meet the following requirements:
         <ol type="a">
          <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1e1a">
           During the lifetime of the surviving spouse, the trust is controlled by one or more nonadverse trustees.
          </li>
          <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1e1b">
           The trustee shall distribute to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse either (i) the entire net income of the trust at least annually or (ii) the income of the trust in such amounts and at such times as the trustee, in its discretion, determines necessary for the health, maintenance, and support of the surviving spouse.
          </li>
          <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1e1c">
           The trustee shall distribute to or for the benefit of the surviving spouse out of the principal of the trust such amounts and at such times as the trustee, in its discretion, determines necessary for the health, maintenance, and support of the surviving spouse.
          </li>
          <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1e1d">
           In exercising discretion, the trustee may be authorized or required to take into consideration all other income assets and other means of support available to the surviving spouse.

         </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="t30a1As30-3.3Aol1e2">
         To the extent that the partial or contingent interest is dependent upon the occurrence of any contingency that is not subject to the control of the surviving spouse and that is not subject to valuation by reference to the mortality and annuity tables set forth in G.S. 8-46 and G.S. 8-47, the contingency will be conclusively presumed to result in the lowest possible value passing to the surviving spouse. However, a life estate or income interest that will terminate upon the surviving spouse's death or remarriage will be valued without regard to the possibility of termination upon remarriage.

        Summary Judgment Proper.
   
   - Widow's claim that the clerk of the superior court did not comply with the procedural requirements of the Elective Share Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a1As30-3.4" target="_self">G.S. 30-3.4</a></cite>, when he resolved the widow's action seeking an elective share on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment was not properly before the court of appeals because the record did not contain any indication that the widow ever objected to the clerk's resolving the case on summary judgment prior to appealing. Pope v. Rollins (In re Estate of Pope), <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 666 S.E.2d 140 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 126</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 129 (2009).

     The cases below were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> to 30-3 and corresponding prior provisions, relating to the right to dissent.
     <br />

</span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative Policy.
   
   - Former G.S. 30-2(b), relating to how and by whom dissent could be given, was an expression of legislative policy which the Court of Appeals would not vitiate. In re Estate of Burleson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 210 S.E.2d 114 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature has created a two-step process
   
   to be used when a surviving spouse attempts to dissent from a deceased spouse's will (claim an elective share): the first step is to determine if the surviving spouse has the right to dissent (to claim an elective share), and the second step is to determine the consequences. In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 101</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 150 (1990); Funk v. Masten, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 465 S.E.2d 322 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Widow Required to Comply with Statute.
   
   - Although a will gave a widow nothing, she was nevertheless required to comply with former section. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 59</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 359 (1962).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dissent signed by a subscribing witness did not comply with former G.S. 30-2(b).
   
   In re Estate of Burleson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 210 S.E.2d 114 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        To hold that the signature by a subscribing witness satisfied the acknowledgment required by former G.S. 30-2(b) would constitute judicial repeal of the 1959 amendment of that section, which provided for acknowledgment of dissents. In re Estate of Burleson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 210 S.E.2d 114 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The guardian of an incompetent widower was authorized to file
   
   a dissent by him from his wife's will under former G.S. 30-2. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Filing Creates Vested Right.
   
   - The timely and correct filing of a proper dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> et seq. constituted an exercise of the right to dissent and created a vested property right in the dissenting spouse. Tighe v. Michal, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 254 S.E.2d 538 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The dissenting spouse, upon filing dissent to the will under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> et seq., became vested, eo instanti, as of the date of the testator's death, with title to the intestate share of the testator's realty which was allowed by the statutes providing therefor. Etheridge v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 44, 255 S.E.2d 729 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 735</cite>, 267 S.E.2d 660 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prompt Determination of Right.
   
   - The legislature intended for the right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> et seq. to be determined as quickly as possible after the dissent was filed. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficiency of Marital Trust.
   
   - Where under the terms of a trust established for his wife by the testator, the trustee was required to fund the trust with assets which would give wife a life income the value of which (when added to the value of other assets passing to wife under and outside the will) would be equal to her intestate share, and there were no allegations or evidence that the assets of the estate were insufficient to meet this requirement, the marital trust established for wife was not insufficient, as a matter of law, to defeat her right of dissent under former law. In re Estate of Finch, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 389 S.E.2d 126 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Surviving Spouse Held to Have No Right to Dissent.
   
   - Under prior statutes, where surviving spouse under will received all of his deceased wife's personal property and, outside the will, received real property owned by the entireties, which was all the real property, he had no right to dissent, because he received everything that he would have received had his wife died without a will. In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 101</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 150 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice to Executor of Intentions of Dissenting Spouse.
   
   - The giving of notice of dissent to the clerk of superior court under former G.S. 30-2(a) was sufficient to alert the executor with respect to the intentions of the dissenting spouse and afford him ample opportunity to prepare for a hearing on the question of the spouse's statutory right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>. In re Estate of Kirkman, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 248 S.E.2d 438 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 584</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 31 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of Clerk to Record Filing.
   
   - While former G.S. 30-2 merely required filing of dissent, it was the duty of the clerk to record the dissent when filed. Philbrick v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 737</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 725 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Recording.
   
   - Recording creates the presumption that the instrument was the act of the widow done in the time and manner required by law. Philbrick v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 737</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 725 (1961).

       <p>
        Former G.S. 30-2 was a statute of limitation, not an enabling statute.
   
   The period provided a widow to dissent from her husband's will was not a condition precedent to that right, but merely limited the time in which she could resort to the courts to enforce it. Whitted v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 81</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 263 (1957); Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 357</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 506 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former G.S. 30-2 was a statute of limitations. It extinguished no right, but limited the time in which a widow could enforce the right the law gave her to participate in her husband's estate. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 59</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 359 (1962).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Filing Procedure Not Determinative of Right.
   
   - The filing procedure prescribed by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a1As30-3.4ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 30-3.4(a)</a></cite> was merely a limitation on the time within which a surviving spouse had to note her dissent of record. It was not conditioned upon or determinative of the right to dissent, which might not be established until some later date. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 238 S.E.2d 790 (1977), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Failure to File Within Time Specified.
   
   - Failure to dissent under former G.S. 30-2 within the time specified did not extinguish the right, it simply barred the action therefor. Overton v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 31</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 593 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time as to When Right Would Arise.
   
   - Although a surviving spouse's right to dissent under prior statutes could not be established until a mathematical computation of the value of the deceased spouse's estate was made, the right to dissent generally arose as of the date of the death of the deceased spouse or it never arose. Tighe v. Michal, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 254 S.E.2d 538 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right time, manner and effect of filing
   
   and recording a dissent to a will under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> were all matters within the probate jurisdiction of the clerk of superior court. In re Estate of Outen, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 818, 336 S.E.2d 436 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 377</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 896 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish the right
   
   to dissent, under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, a spouse had to make a timely filing, and to show an entitlement to that right. In re Estate of Outen, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 818, 336 S.E.2d 436 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 377</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 896 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time Limitations of Six Months.
   
   - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> allowed a surviving spouse six months from the probate of the will within which to dissent. Joyce v. Joyce, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 757</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 675 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time Is to Enable Surviving Spouse to Reach Intelligent Conclusion.
   
   - Time is allowed by statute to enable the surviving spouse to make an examination into the value of the estate, the debts and liabilities, and for her to come to an intelligent conclusion as to the course she should pursue under all the circumstances that surround her. Joyce v. Joyce, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 757</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 675 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute Tolled by Disability.
   
   - The six-month period of limitation in former G.S. 30-2 for dissenting from a will in probate was a statute of limitations which could be tolled by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa03s1-17" target="_blank">G.S. 1-17</a></cite> for a disability. In re Estate of Owens, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 450 S.E.2d 2 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointment of Guardian after Six Months.
   
   - Where no guardian for an insane widow was appointed within six months after her husband's will was proved, but one was subsequently appointed and he filed a dissent on her behalf on the day he was appointed, the widow was not barred by the statute of limitations in former G.S. 30-2, but could bring the action through a guardian as within three years after the disability was removed pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIa03s1-17" target="_blank">G.S. 1-17</a></cite>. Whitted v. Wade, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 81</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 263 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute Ran Against Insane Widow from Appointment of Guardian.
   
   - The statute of limitation provided in former G.S. 30-2 began to run against an insane widow's right to dissent from the date a guardian was appointed. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 59</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 359 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although an insane widow received nothing in the will of her husband, the failure of her guardian to dissent for her within six months of his qualification barred her right of dissent under former G.S. 30-2 at the end of that period. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 59</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 359 (1962).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Dissent Timely.
   
   - Under former G.S. 30-2, so long as the dissent was filed within six months after the issuance of letters testamentary, or extended pursuant to former G.S. 30-2(a), it was timely, regardless of whether the appraisal had been conducted. In re Estate of Cox, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 765, 233 S.E.2d 926, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 729</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 783 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Spouse Must File Within Time Limit Although Right Not Finally Established.
   
   - A surviving spouse could and, in fact, had to file her dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> within the statutory time period even though her right to dissent was not finally established until after the statutory time period had expired due to the necessity of ascertaining "net estate." Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 238 S.E.2d 790 (1977), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

        Constitutionality of Methods of Determining Values.
   
   - The values which must be determined under the statutory procedure can be reasonably ascertained by the use of aids such as tax tables and expert witnesses, and the procedure is not constitutionally invalid. The procedure set forth in former
   statute did not approach that level of arbitrary governmental action necessary to support a claim of denial of due process. In re Estate of Kirkman, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 515, 248 S.E.2d 438 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 584</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 31 (1979).

        Contributions by Surviving Spouse Excluded.
   
   - The plain meaning of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> completely excluded any property or interest in property to the extent that the surviving spouse gave, donated, contributed, or paid for it.

        Purposes for Which Established Value Binding under Former Statute.
   
   - Any determination and establishment of value made as provided in former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> was binding only for the purposes of determining whether there was a right of dissent.

        Method for Determining Different Benefits.
   
   - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 30-1(c)</a></cite> provided a method by which to determine the value of benefits under the will and the benefits in case of intestacy.

   - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> provided that when values were determined as set out therein, they would be final for determining the right of dissent and should be used exclusively for this purpose. No doubt when this legislation was enacted it was contemplated that the right to dissent would be thus mathematically established. In re Estate of Connor, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 168 S.E.2d 245 (1969).

        Under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>,
   
   if A equalled the aggregate value of provisions under the will for the benefit of the surviving spouse and B equalled the value of property or interests in property passing in any manner outside the will to the surviving spouse as a result of the death of the testator, and C equalled the net estate of the decedent, then the surviving spouse was entitled to dissent from his wife's will if A plus B was less than one-half of C; that is, if A + B &lt; 1/2(C). In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 101</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 150 (1990).

       <p>
        Under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, statutory scheme contemplated that the surviving spouse's right of dissent would be established by a mathematical computation.

       <p>
        Right Could Not Be Established Until Property Is Determined and Valued.
   
   - In the absence of a determination and valuation of the property passing to the surviving spouse under the will and outside the will as of the date of the death of the deceased spouse as provided by former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, there could be no proper determination of whether the right to dissent had been established. When the property involved is determined and valued as provided by statute, then the right of dissent can be determined mathematically. In re Estate of Connor, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C.

        Property Determined and Valued as of Date of Testator's Death.
   
   - Former statute, which permitted dissent in certain instances, also required that the property involved be determined and valued as of the date of death of the testator. The procedure was mandatory. In re Estate of Connor, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 168 S.E.2d 245 (1969).

   - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 30-1(c)</a></cite> did not require the intestate share to be determined, for purposes of establishing the right to dissent, from decedent's gross estate valued as of the date of his death rather than from net estate. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 428, 238 S.E.2d 790 (1977), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

       <p>
        In establishing the right of a surviving spouse to dissent pursuant to former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1(a)(1)</a></cite>, the determination of intestate share would be based on the value of the decedent's net estate, as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-1" target="_blank">G.S. 29-1</a></cite> et seq.

        Computation of Net Estate.
   
   - To ascertain "net estate" under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-2" target="_blank">G.S. 29-2(5)</a></cite>, it is necessary to subtract from the value of the gross estate, "family allowances, costs of administration, and all lawful claims against the estate." Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the intestate share of any surviving spouse, or other heir, is ordinarily a percentage of the decedent's net estate, for purposes of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, the amount of the net estate had to be determined within limits which would permit the court to ascertain with substantial accuracy whether the value of the intestate share of the surviving spouse was less or greater than the value of the property passing to her in and outside the will. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        Value Seldom Determined with Complete Accuracy Prior to Final Account.
   
   - Prior to the time the personal representative files his final account, it will seldom, if ever, be possible to determine with complete accuracy the value of the testator's net estate and the intestate share of the surviving spouse.

   - Under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, the right to dissent was to be determined by the clerk whenever, in his judgment, the value of the "net estate" could be estimated with reasonable accuracy, rather than such time as the actual value of the net estate could be ascertained, i.e., at the time of distribution.

   - Under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, the value of real property owned by couple as tenants by the entirety was not to be included in testatrix's net estate.

       </p>
       <p>
        Real property held as tenants by the entirety could not be included in net estate for purposes of determining right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>.

       <p>
        For purposes of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, real property owned by the entireties was included in the value of property passing to surviving spouse outside the will as a result of the death of the testator.

        Listing Survivorship Accounts on 90-Day Inventory Did Not Make Those Accounts Part of Net Estate.
   
   - Fact that executrix listed one-half of funds in survivorship accounts on 90-day inventory to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a01s41-2.1ol1b3" target="_blank">G.S. 41-2.1(b)(3)</a></cite> and (b)(4) did not make the funds part of the net estate for purposes of determining her right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Bank Account Held as Joint Tenants.
   
   - Where testatrix retained complete control over the assets of the bank account held by herself and her husband as joint tenants with right of survivorship until the moment of her death, public policy expressed in the former dissent statutes would be served by including in the net estate for purposes of the dissent statute the value of the bank accounts. In re Estate of Francis, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 381 S.E.2d 484, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 101</cite>, 394 S.E.2d 150 (1990).

        Property Given or Paid for by Surviving Spouse.
   
   - The plain meaning of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> completely excluded any property or interest in property to the extent that the surviving spouse gave, donated, contributed, or paid for it. Once the property was excluded, no other valuation as to that specific property could be made. Funk v. Masten, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 485 S.E.2d 890 (1997).

       <p>
        Property Held as Tenants by Entirety and Paid for by Surviving Spouse.
   
   - For purposes of calculating the surviving spouse's right to dissent (right to claim an elective share), none of the value of the property owned as tenants by the entirety could be included in the value of property passing outside the will to the surviving spouse when the surviving spouse contributed the total purchase price of the property. Funk v. Masten, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 485 S.E.2d 890 (1997).

        Federal estate tax was a "lawful claim" against testator's estate,
   
   for purposes of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> and the widow's intestate share of the estate was to be computed after its deduction. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).

       <p>
        Variance between Valuations and Ultimate Distributive Share.
   
   - The language of former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 30-1(c)</a></cite>, which established a valuation procedure for the purpose of establishing the right of dissent and mandated that the value so determined be used exclusively for that purpose, indicated that the General Assembly anticipated a variance between this valuation and the ultimate distributive share. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 590</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 761 (1979).
   <br />

       <p>
        Clerk's Approval of Valuation Required.
   
   - To establish her entitlement to the right of dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, surviving spouse was required to obtain the clerk's approval of the value of the property passing to her under and outside her husband's will as of the date of his death.

        Agreement as to Valuation.
   
   - Under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, absent a showing that the parties failed to act in an arm's length manner, or that the rights of creditors of the estate would be adversely affected thereby, it was proper for the clerk ought to abide by an agreement as to the valuation of the estate and the testate and intestate shares thereof. Taylor v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 357</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 506 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement Between Personal Representative and Dissenting Spouse as to Net Estate.
   
   - Where the testator's personal representative and the dissenting spouse, dealing at arm's length, were able to agree upon the value of the "net estate," the clerk or the court would ordinarily abide by this agreement in determining the right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>.

   - When a surviving spouse dissented from a will under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite> et seq., the intestate share was to be allocated so as to cause the least possible disruption of the decedent's plan for the distribution of his estate.

       Release of Right Held Effective.
   
   - Although husband's release did not enumerate the statutory right to dissent under former <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a01s30-1" target="_self">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, where it did release "all rights or claims of curtesy, inheritance, descent, and distribution and all other rights or claims growing out of the marital relationship between the parties . . .

      - Session Laws 2013-81, s. 3, made the amendment to this section by Session Laws 2013-81, s. 1, applicable to estates of persons dying on or after January 1, 2014.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2018-40, s. 9.1, which amended this section, is located in Part IX of Session Laws 2018-40. Section 9.2 of that act provides, "This section becomes effective January 1, 2019, and applies to allowance applications made on or after that date." The reference to "This section" in Section 9.2 appears to have been in error and "This Part" was apparently the intended wording. Section 15 of the act provides that, except as otherwise provided, the act is effective when it becomes law.

       When Husband Dies a Citizen of Another State.
   
   - It has been held that the widow of a man who dies a citizen of another state is not entitled to a year's support out of the assets of the decedent in this State, and the fact that she became a citizen of this State after her husband's death is immaterial, since her relations to the estate and her right to share in it are fixed at the intestate's death, and by the laws of his domicile. Simpson v. Cureton, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 112</cite>, 2 S.E. 668 (1887). See Medley v. Dunlap, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 527</cite> (1884).
      </p>
      <p>
       A widow whose husband died domiciled in another state is entitled to her year's support in this State in which there is a fund due her husband, if the widow is a bona fide resident in the State. The reason given for this ruling is that the fiction of personal property being considered as belonging to the domicile of the owner applies only to the distribution of the assets of the one deceased, and has no application to payment of debts, legacies, costs of administration, etc. Jones v. Layne, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. 600</cite>, 57 S.E. 372 (1907). See also Moye v. May, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. 131</cite> (1851), petition to rehear dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. 84</cite> (1853); Kimball v.

        Agreement to Satisfy Allowance Proper.

       - Trial court properly allowed an estate's motion to satisfy the deficiency judgment awarded to the surviving spouse for her statutory allowance out of the surplus proceeds from the sale of real property because the parties expressly agreed that the estate would pay the deficiency judgment from the surplus sale proceeds; the law did not prohibit the creation and recognition of a private contractual claim to such proceeds where all other debts of the estate had been satisfied.

      If the child resides with the surviving spouse of the deceased parent at the time the allowance is paid, the allowance shall be paid to the surviving spouse for the benefit of the child. If the child resides with its surviving parent who is other than the surviving spouse of the deceased parent, the allowance shall be paid to the surviving parent for the use and benefit of the child. The payment shall be made regardless of whether the deceased died testate or intestate or whether the surviving spouse petitioned for an elective share under Article 1A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.030.html" target="_blank">Chapter 30</a></cite> of the General Statutes. Provided, however, the allowance shall not be available to a deceased father's child born out of wedlock, unless the deceased father has recognized the paternity of the child by deed, will, or other paper-writing, or unless the deceased father died prior to or within one year after the birth of the child and is established to have been the father of the child by DNA testing. If the child does not reside with a surviving spouse or a surviving parent when the allowance is paid, the allowance shall be paid to the child's general guardian or guardian of the estate, if any, and if none, to the clerk of the superior court who shall receive and disburse the allowance for the benefit of the child.

      <p>
       Meaning of Annual Net Income.
   
   - The provision of this section that the allowance shall not exceed "the one half of the [average] annual net income of the deceased for three years next preceding his death" means the one half of one year's net income, determined by the average annual income for the three years next preceding the decease, and not one half of the sum total of the annual net income for the three-year period. Holland v. Henson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 742</cite>, 128 S.E. 145 (1925).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Net income" in this section is not "adjusted gross income," but rather is to be computed after deducting all federal and state income taxes attributable to the income received by the decedent during the three years preceding his death. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Net income in this section means "take home pay" or "after-tax income," because this is the only income that is "netted," that is truly available for family support purposes in a real sense, as any employee whose earnings are subject to withholding can testify. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficient Allowance to Maintain Standard of Living.
   
   - This section is designed to permit the allowance to the surviving spouse of a solvent decedent of an amount sufficient to maintain for a period that standard of living to which he or she had been accustomed, thereby avoiding the hardship which an immediate and drastic reduction in income would entail. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the larger allowance authorized by this Part appears to be to provide the surviving spouse of a solvent decedent with a level of support commensurate with the support which he or she would have had from the deceased spouse during the first year after the spouse's death had the death not occurred. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature by this section intended the widow to receive an allotment not exceeding one half of the income which would probably have been actually received by and available to her deceased husband for the support of his family, had he lived an additional year. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance May Be Less Than Prescribed Maximum.
   
   - The formula in this section serves only to calculate the maximum allowance which may be assigned and does not represent an amount which must be assigned. The only requirement laid down by this section is that the allowance be, within the maximum limit specified, "a value sufficient for the support of plaintiff according to the estate and condition of the decedent." In some cases, this amount could be considerably less than the statutorily prescribed maximum. Pritchard v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 248 S.E.2d 467 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Approval of Allowance Less Than Maximum.
   
   - Where the superior court found a sum which a widow has agreed to accept to be reasonable and proper, though less than her maximum allowance would have been if calculated under this section, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t30a04s30-27" target="_self">G.S. 30-27</a></cite> gives the court the jurisdiction to make the allowance agreed upon. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 454</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 651 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowance Sustained Where Discretion Not Abused.
   
   - Where the estate of the deceased husband is large and in good condition, and he received a net annual income for three years prior to his death of over $38,500, an allowance of $12,500 for a year's support to his widow with minor son, less the value of the household furniture, is not an abuse of the superior court's discretion which the Supreme Court will review. Drewry v. Raleigh Sav. Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 664</cite>, 92 S.E. 593 (1917).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Agreement to Satisfy Allowance Proper.
       </b>
       - Trial court properly allowed an estate's motion to satisfy the deficiency judgment awarded to the surviving spouse for her statutory allowance out of the surplus proceeds from the sale of real property because the parties expressly agreed that the estate would pay the deficiency judgment from the surplus sale proceeds; the law did not prohibit the creation and recognition of a private contractual claim to such proceeds where all other debts of the estate had been satisfied.

   - This section was amended by Session Laws 2011-284, s. 25, effective June 24, 2011, and Session Laws 2011-344, s. 7, effective January 1, 2012, and applicable to estates of decedents dying on or after that date, in the coded bill drafting format provided by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120.html#t120a06s120-20.1" target="_blank">G.S. 120-20.1</a></cite>. Session Laws 2011-344, s. 7, which repealed this section by striking through the text, did not account for the additions to the section made by Session Laws 2011-284. Session Laws 2012-194, s. 40, effective June 17, 2012, repealed Session Laws 2011-184, s. 25, and the section has now been set out as repealed by Session Laws 2011-344, s. 7.
