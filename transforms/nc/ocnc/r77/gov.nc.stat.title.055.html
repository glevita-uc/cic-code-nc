     NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY
    </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This revision of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act is based upon the Revised Model Business Corporation Act (1984) (hereinafter "the Model Act"). To maintain uniformity, the numbering of the sections corresponds to that of the Model Act, except
            that the General Statutes <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> number has been added to each section and the Model Act chapters have been changed to articles.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two types of comments appear. Under the designation "Official Comment" is the Official Comment of the Section of Corporation, Banking and Business Law of the American Bar Association for that section. Under the designation "North Carolina Comment" are
            the comments of the drafters who adapted the Model Act for enactment in North Carolina. The North Carolina comments are designed to note (1) deviations from the Model Act and (2) some significant changes from the former law. Some sections
            therefore do not have a North Carolina Comment.
        </p>
        <p>
            Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1989, ch. 265, s. 1, effective July 1, 1990, rewrote <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> and entitled it the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, to
            replace former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, entitled the Business Corporation Act, which had been adopted by Session Laws 1955, c. 1371, s. 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 2 of Session Laws 1989, c. 265 provided: "The Revisor of Statutes shall cause to be printed along with this act all relevant portions of the Official Comments to the 1984 Revised Model Business Corporation Act and all explanatory comments of the
            drafters of this act as the Revisor may deem appropriate."
        </p>
        <p>
            The Official Comments appearing under individual sections in this Chapter have been printed by the publisher as received, without editorial change, and relate to the Chapter as originally enacted. However, not all sections in this Chapter may carry Official
            Comments. Furthermore, Official Comments may or may not have been received or updated in conjunction with subsequent amendments to this Chapter and, therefore, may not reflect all changes to the sections under which they appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where they appear in this Chapter, "Amended Comment" usually means that an error in the original comment has been corrected by a subsequent amendment, and "Supplemental Comment" pertains to a later development, such as an amendment to the statute text.
            North Carolina Comments explain where the General Assembly has enacted variations to the text of the Uniform Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where appropriate, the historical citations to sections of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> have been added to corresponding sections in current <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the case notes appearing under the sections of this Chapter were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite> or under prior law.
        </p>
        <p>
            For tables of corresponding sections of former and current <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, see the tables at the end of this Chapter.

                    <p>
                        Provisions similar to section 1.02 have their genesis in
                        <i>
        Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward,
       </i> 17 U.S. (4 Wheat) 518 (1819), which held that the United States Constitution prohibited the application of newly enacted statutes to existing corporations while suggesting the efficacy of a reservation of power similar
                        to section 1.02. The purpose of section 1.02 is to avoid any possible argument that a corporation has contractual or vested rights in any specific statutory provision and to ensure that the state may in the future modify its corporation
                        statutes as it deems appropriate and require existing corporations to comply with the statutes as modified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All articles of incorporation or certificates of authority granted under the Model Act are subject to the reservation of power set forth in section 1.02. Further, corporations "governed" by this Act - which includes all corporations formed or qualified
                        under earlier, general incorporation statutes that contain a reservation of power - are also subject to the reservation of power of section 1.02 and bound by subsequent amendments to the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many states have constitutional provisions mandating the reservation of power to amend or modify corporate statutes and charters. In these states section 1.02 is also supported by specific constitutional authorization.

                    <p>
                        As described in the Official Comment to section 1.20, documents are entitled to filing under the Model Act if they meet the substantive and formal requirements of the Act; they may also contain additional information if the person submitting the document
                        so elects. See the Official Comments to sections 1.20 and 1.25. In these circumstances it is not appropriate to vest the secretary of state with general authority to establish mandatory forms for use under the Model Act. Certain
                        types of reports and requests for documents may be processed efficiently only if uniform forms are prescribed by the secretary of state. Certificates of existence, for example, should require specific information located at specific
                        places on the form; similarly, processing of large-volume, largely routine filings is expedited if standardized forms are required. Also, the disclosure requirements of the annual report may be administered on a systematic basis
                        if a standardized form is mandated. Section 1.21(a) recognizes that these considerations may exist in limited cases, and expressly enumerates those forms for which the secretary of state is authorized to establish mandatory forms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.21(b) authorizes (but does not require) the secretary of state to prepare forms suitable for use for other documents required or permitted to be filed under the Act. However, the use of these forms is permissive and cannot be required by the
                        secretary of state.

                    <p>
                        Section 1.22 establishes in a single section the filing fees for all documents that may be filed under the Model Act. The dollar amounts for each document should be inserted by each state as it adopts the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The list of documents in section 1.22 includes all documents that are authorized to be filed with the secretary of state under the Model Act. The catch-all in subdivision (26) will apply to any document for which a state does not establish a specific
                        filing fee plus any document that later amendments to the statute may authorize or direct be filed with the secretary of state without establishing a specific filing fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subdivision (9) states that no fee is applicable to filing the resignation of a registered agent. This provision permits a person who is named as a registered agent without his consent, or who agrees to serve as registered agent for a fee and the fee
                        is not paid, to eliminate any reference to himself in the records of the secretary of state without expense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subdivision (8) contains a maximum fee for filing a change of address of a registered agent. Since corporation service companies serve as registered agents for thousands of corporations in many jurisdictions, their change of address may require a very
                        large number of filings. Hence, the fee is broadly based on the number of corporations affected but a maximum fee is specified to reflect that as the number of changes increases the cost per change should decrease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 11.07, 15.20, and 15.31 require the secretary of state to serve process on foreign corporations under the circumstances there specified. The fee for this service is set forth in section 1.22(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.22(c) establishes standard fees for coping filed documents and certifying that copies are true copies under section 1.27.

                        This section contains a new fee schedule covering documents required or permitted to be filed under this Act, and the fees shown here combine the fees and taxes that were separately covered in former G.S. 55-155 and former G.S. 55-156. In some cases the
                        fees are higher than the fees and taxes under the prior law. The sliding scale that applied in some cases under the prior law is eliminated in favor of a flat fee in all cases. The format was adopted from the Model Act.

       </b> - Session Laws 2001-358, s. 53, provided that the act, which amended this section, was effective October 1, 2001, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date. Section 173 of Session Laws 2001-387
                        changed the effective date of Session Laws 2001-358 from October 1, 2001, to January 1, 2002. Section 6 of Session Laws 2001-413, effective September 14, 2001, added a sentence to s. 175(a) of Session Laws 2001-387, making s. 173
                        of that act effective when it became law (August 26, 2001). As a result of these changes, the amendment by Session Laws 2001-358 is effective January 1, 2002, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date.

                        Section 1.28 establishes a procedure by which anyone may obtain a conclusive certificate from the secretary of state that a particular domestic or foreign corporation is in existence or is authorized to transact business in the state. The certificate
                        will probably be a standardized form. The secretary of state is to make the judgment whether or not the corporation is in existence or is authorized to transact business from public records only and is not expected to make a more
                        extensive investigation. In appropriate cases, the secretary of state may issue a certificate subject to specified qualifications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.28(b)(5) refers only to taxes, fees, or penalties collected by the secretary of state or collected by other agencies and reported to the secretary of state. In some states the secretary of state may ascertain from other agencies that franchise
                        or other taxes have been paid and include this information in the certificate. In states where this procedure does not unduly delay the issuance of certificates, section 1.28 may be revised appropriately. Section 1.28(b)(5) relates
                        only to taxes, fees, or penalties to the extent their nonpayment affects the existence or authorization to transact business of the corporation.

                        Although it has no express counterpart in prior law, this section codifies the practice of the Secretary of State of issuing "certificates of good standing." Although subdivision (b)(3) refers only to taxes, fees and penalties collected by the Secretary
                        of State, it is expected that the North Carolina Department of Revenue will continue the practice of giving letters confirming the payment of fees and taxes and penalties collectible by the Department.

                        Section 1.30 is intended to grant the secretary of state the authority necessary for his efficient performance of the filing and other duties imposed on him by the Act but is not intended to give him general authority to establish public policy. The most
                        important aspects of a modern corporation statute relate to the creation and maintenance of relationships among persons interested in or involved with a corporation; these relationships basically should be a matter of concern to
                        the parties involved and not subject to regulation or interpretation by the secretary of state. Further, even in situations where it is claimed that the corporation has been formed or is being operated for purposes that may violate
                        the public policies of the state, the secretary of state generally should not be the governmental official that determines the scope of public policy through administration of his filing responsibilities under the Act. Rather,
                        the attorney general may seek to enjoin the illegal conduct or to dissolve involuntarily the offending corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.30 is more narrowly drafted than earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states.

                    such interrogatories shall be answered within 30 days after the mailing therefor, or within such additional time as shall be fixed by the Secretary of State, and the answers thereto shall be full and complete and shall be made in writing
                    and under oath. If such interrogatories be directed to an individual they shall be answered by him, and if directed to a corporation they shall be answered by the president, vice-president, secretary or assistant secretary thereof.
                    The Secretary of State shall certify to the Attorney General, for such action as the Attorney General may deem appropriate, all interrogatories and answers thereto which disclose a violation of any of the provisions of this Chapter,

                        Section 1.40 collects in a single section definitions of terms used throughout the Model Act. Subchapters and sections of the Act in a few instances contain specialized definitions applicable only to those subchapters or sections.

                    <p>
                        Most of the definitions of section 1.40 are drawn directly from earlier versions of the Model Act and are reasonably self-explanatory. A number of definitions, however, are new or deserve further explanation.

                        "Conspicuous" is defined in section 1.40(3) basically as defined in section 1-201(10) of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. Even though the definition indicates some of the methods by which a provision may be made attention-calling, the test is whether attention
                        can reasonably be expected to be called to it.

                        "Corporation," "domestic corporation," and "foreign corporation" are defined in sections 1.40(4) and (10). The word "corporation," when used alone, refers only to domestic corporations. In a few instances, the phrase "domestic corporation" has been used
                        in order to contrast it with a foreign corporation.

                    <p>
                        The term "distribution" defined in section 1.40(6) is a fundamental element of the financial provisions of the Model Act as amended in 1980. Section 6.40 sets forth a single, unitary test for the validity of any "distribution." Section 1.40(6) in turn
                        defines "distribution" to include all transfers of money or other property made by a corporation to any shareholder in respect of the corporation's shares, except mere changes in the unit of interest such as share dividends and
                        share splits. Thus, a "distribution" includes the declaration or payment of a dividend, a purchase by a corporation of its own shares, a distribution of evidences of indebtedness or promissory notes of the corporation, and a distribution
                        in voluntary or involuntary liquidation. If a corporation incurs indebtedness in connection with a distribution (as in the case of a distribution of a debt instrument or an installment purchase of shares), the creation, incurrence,
                        or distribution of the indebtedness is the event which constitutes the distribution rather than the subsequent payment of the debt by the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "indirect" in the definition of "distribution" is intended to include transactions like the repurchase of parent company shares by a subsidiary whose actions are controlled by the parent. It also is intended to include any other transaction in
                        which the substance is clearly the same as a typical dividend or share repurchase, no matter how structured or labeled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "entity," defined in section 1.40(9), appears in the definition of "person" in section 1.40(16) and is included to cover all types of artificial persons. See also the definitions of "governmental subdivision," in section 1.40(11), "state," in
                        section 1.40(23), and "United States," in section 1.40(25).

                    <p>
                        Section 1.40(17) defines the principal office of a corporation to be the office, within or without the state, where the principal executive office of the corporation is located. Many corporations maintain numerous offices, but there if usually one office,
                        sometimes colloquially referred to as the home office, headquarters, or executive suite, where the principal corporate officers are located. The corporation must designate its principal office address in the annual report required
                        by section 16.22. In case of doubt as to which corporate office is the principal office, the designation by the corporation in its annual report should be accepted as establishing the principal office of the corporation.

                    <p>
                        The definition of "shareholder" in section 1.40(22) includes a beneficial owner of shares named in a nominee certificate under section 7.23, but only to the extent of the rights granted the beneficial owner in the certificate - for example, the right
                        to receive notice of, and vote at, shareholders' meeting. Various substantive sections of the Model Act also permit holders of voting trust certificates or beneficial owners of shares (not subject to a nominee certificate under
                        section 7.23) to exercise some of the rights of a "shareholder." See, for example, section 7.40 (derivative proceedings).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "secretary" is defined in section 1.40(20) since the Model Act does not require the corporation to maintain any specific or titled officers. See section 8.40. However, some corporate officer, however titled, must perform the functions described
                        in this definition, and that officer is referred to as the "secretary" in various sections of the Act that impose a duty on him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "person" is defined in section 1.40(16) to include an individual or an entity. In the case of an individual the Model Act assumes that the person is competent to act in the matter under general state law independent of the corporation statute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.40(26) defines "voting group" for purposes of the Act as a matter of convenient reference. A "voting group" consists of all shares of one or more classes or series that under the articles of incorporation or the revised Model Act are entitled
                        to vote and be counted together collectively on a matter. Shares entitled to vote "generally" on a matter under the articles of incorporation or this Act are for that purpose a single voting group. The word "generally" signifies
                        all shares entitled to vote on the matter by the articles of incorporation or this Act that do not expressly have the right to be counted or tabulated separately. "Voting groups" are thus the basic units of collective voting at
                        a shareholders' meeting, and voting by voting groups may provide essential protection to one or more classes or series of shares against actions that are detrimental to the rights or interests of that class or series.

                        The determination of which shares form part of a single voting group must be made from the provisions of the articles of incorporation and of this Act. In a few instances under the Model Act, the board of directors may establish the right to vote by voting
                        groups. On most matters coming before shareholders' meetings, only a single voting group, consisting of a class of voting or common shares, will be involved, and action on such a matter is effective when approved by that voting
                        group pursuant to section 7.25. See section 7.26(a). If a second class of shares is also entitled to vote on the matter, then a further determination must be made as to whether that class is to vote as a separate voting group or
                        whether it is to vote along with the other voting shares as part of a single voting group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Members of the board of directors are usually elected by the single voting group of shares entitled to vote generally; in some circumstances, however, some members of the board may be selected by one voting group and other members by one or more different
                        voting groups. See section 8.03.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of a voting group permits the establishment by statute of quorum and voting requirements for a variety of matters considered at shareholders' meetings in corporations with multiple classes of shares. See sections 7.25 and 7.26. Depending
                        on the circumstances, two classes or series of shares may vote together collectively on a matter as a single voting group, they may be entitled to vote on the matter separately as two voting groups, or one or both of them may not
                        be entitled to vote on the matter at all.

                    <p>
                        This section defines more terms than were defined in former G.S. 55-2 and in some cases the definitions are different. The following differences should be noted:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act in certain respects:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (i) The phrase "unless otherwise specifically provided" was added to the introduction to allow for different definitions in Article 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (ii) Except for the final clause thereof, the definition of "corporation" was brought forward with minor modifications from prior law. The final clause, relating to the use of the term "corporation" in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a09s55-9-01" target="_self">G.S. 55-9-01</a></cite>,
                        was considered necessary because that section, which was brought forward from prior law, uses the term "corporation" in certain cases to refer to any corporation, foreign or domestic. In the remainder of Article 9, the term "corporation"
                        refers to domestic corporations only.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act uses the term "not-for-profit corporation" rather than the term "nonprofit corporation," which is used in this Act. The terms "not-for-profit corporation" and "nonprofit corporation" are interchangeable in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>.
                        "Non-profit corporation" and "nonprofit association" were therefore used throughout this Act.

                        Section 1.41(c) provides that notice by a corporation to its shareholders is effective when mailed if correctly addressed with sufficient postage. The correct address for this purpose is the address shown in the corporation's records. The effect of this
                        section is to permit the corporation to compute the statutory time periods for notice of shareholders' meetings and other actions from the date the notice is mailed without regard to where its shareholders are located or the time
                        it takes for the mail to reach them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Written notice to shareholders by persons other than the corporation is effective as provided in section 1.41(e). Notice by the corporation to its shareholders that is not addressed to the record address of the shareholder is effective when received under
                        section 1.41(e).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.41(d) provides that notice to a corporation may be addressed to the registered agent of the corporation at its registered office or to the corporation or its secretary at the principal office of the corporation as shown in its most recent public
                        filing. An officer, director, or shareholder of a corporation will normally give written notice to the corporation by delivering or mailing a copy of that notice to the corporation or to the secretary of the corporation at its
                        principal office. Such a notice is effective when it is received. Such notice may be given for a variety of purposes under this Act, e.g., giving notice of intent to dissent (section 13.21), notice of a demand to inspect books
                        and records (section 16.02), and notices of resignation (sections 8.07 and 8.43). This method of giving notice to the corporation, however, is not exclusive, and an officer, director, or shareholder may give notice in other ways
                        as well.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Persons who have no prior relationship with the corporation may give notice either to the registered agent of the corporation, or if they wish, to the corporation or its secretary at its principal office.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.41 also contains a variety of general provisions dealing with notice. It recognizes, for example, that notice on some occasions may be given orally if that is reasonable under the circumstances. It also deals with situations where notice may
                        be sought to be given to persons for whom no current address is available, or where personal notice is impractical. Notice delivered to the person's last known address is effective as described in section 1.41(e) even though never
                        actually received by the person. Section 1.41(b) also authorizes notice by publication in some circumstances, including radio, television, or other form of public wire or wireless communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.41(g) recognizes that other sections of the Act prescribe specific notice requirements for particular situations - e.g., service of process on a corporation's registered agent under section 5.04 - and that these specific requirements, rather
                        than the general requirements of section 1.41, control. Finally, the second sentence of subsection 1.41(g) permits a corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws to prescribe the corporation's own notice requirements, if they
                        are not inconsistent with the general requirements of this section or specific requirements of other sections of the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rules set forth in section 1.41 permit many other sections of the Model Act to be phrased simply in terms of giving or delivering notice without repeating details with respect to how notice should be given and when it is effective in various circumstances.

                    <p>
                        Section 1.42 provides rules for determining the number of shareholders in a corporation. The Model Act generally avoids provisions that are based on the number of shareholders of a corporation, since these provisions may encourage individual shareholders
                        to divide or combine their holdings for private strategic advantage. But in two instances the number of shareholders is critical: to permit a corporation to dispense with a board of directors as its principal form of corporate
                        governance under section 8.01 and to elect close corporation status under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement. The determination of the precise number of shareholders may also become important in other contexts in
                        the future.

                        The definitions of "corporate action," "defective corporate action" and "failure of authorization" are intentionally broad so as to permit ratification of any corporate action purportedly taken that would have been within the power granted to a corporation
                        under the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The term "defective corporate action" includes an "overissue" of shares and other defects in share issuances that could cause shares to be treated as void. For purposes of determining which shares are overissued, only those shares issued in excess of
                        the number of shares permitted to be issued under section 6.01 of the Act would be deemed overissued shares. If it cannot be determined from the records of the corporation which shares were issued before others, all shares included
                        in an issuance that is or results in an overissue would be overissued shares.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT, =nl 2016 REVISION

                    <p>
                        Subchapter E provides a statutory ratification procedure for corporate actions that may not have been properly authorized and shares that may have been improperly issued. The statutory ratification procedure is designed to supplement common law ratification.
                        Corporate actions ratified under this subchapter remain subject to equitable review.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Examples of defective corporate actions subject to ratification include the failure of the incorporator to validly appoint an initial board of directors, corporate action taken in the absence of board resolutions authorizing the action, the failure to
                        obtain the requisite shareholder approval of a corporate action, issuance of shares in the absence of evidence that consideration payable to the corporation for shares was received, the failure to comply with appraisal requirements
                        and the issuance of shares without complying with preemptive rights. The ratification procedure is intended to be available only where there is objective evidence that a corporate action was defectively implemented. For example,
                        subchapter E would permit ratification of shares previously issued but subsequently determined to have been issued improperly. It would not permit the corporation to issue shares retroactively as of an earlier date, however, where
                        there is no objective evidence that those shares had previously been issued. Objective evidence may include resolutions, issuance of share certificates, subscription or share purchase agreements, entries in a share ledger or other
                        correspondence indicating that shares were issued or intended to have been issued.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.46(a) does not distinguish between void and voidable actions. Instead it provides that any defective corporate action that is ratified in accordance with section 1.47 or validated under section 1.52 shall not be void or voidable. Section 1.47
                        is not the exclusive means by which a defective corporate action may be ratified. Thus, the general common law doctrine of ratification, as applied to a board of directors' adoption of actions taken by officers who may not have
                        had the actual authority to take such actions, continues to be an effective mode of ratification. Section 1.46(b) makes clear that the corporation's ratification of a defective corporate action that is voidable but not void using
                        common law methods of ratification rather than under section 1.47 will not, standing alone, affect the validity of the action or create a presumption that the action is not valid. In addition, ratification under subchapter E is
                        distinct from correction of an already filed document under section 1.24.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.46(c) provides that an overissue can be remedied by the adoption of articles of amendment or other corporate action that has the effect of authorizing, designating or creating shares of a series or class, such that the putative shares that resulted
                        in the overissue are deemed to be validly issued from the date of original issuance. This provision enables a corporation to cure an overissue occurring when shares have been duly authorized but are issued before articles of amendment
                        are filed. It also permits a corporation to remedy an overissue even if it cannot specifically identify the putative shares.

                        Notwithstanding the shareholder notice required by section 1.48(b), only valid shares are entitled to vote on the ratification action or counted for quorum purposes. The retroactive effect of a ratification of putative shares does not invalidate the quorum
                        or voting result of the ratification.

                        For matters other than the election of directors, the quorum and voting requirements applicable to shareholder approval of ratification are the quorum and voting requirements applicable to the corporate action being ratified at the time of such approval.
                        For example, if the defective corporate action being ratified is an amendment to the articles of incorporation, whether in connection with an overissue or otherwise, the vote required would be governed by section 10.03. If the
                        defective corporate action involves a merger, the vote required would be the vote required by section 11.04.

                        Ratification is effective as of the validation effective time and is not dependent on the expiration of the 120-day time period in which an action challenging the ratification must be brought. The ratification of a defective corporate action has the additional
                        effect of ratifying corporate actions that are defective as a result of the original defective corporate action. For example, an overissue which results in subsequent director elections being invalid calls into question all actions
                        by the invalidly elected board members. The ratification of the overissue, however, would cure any such additional defects.

                    <p>
                        Section 1.52 confers plenary jurisdiction on a designated court to hear and determine claims regarding the validity of any corporate action or any shares, rights, options or warrants. The court's jurisdiction is not limited to reviewing corporate actions
                        ratified or purportedly ratified under section 1.47, and includes the ability of a corporation or other permitted person to obtain a declaration regarding the validity of any corporate actions or shares that are potentially defective.
                        In determining the validity of a corporate action or reviewing a corporate action ratified under section 1.47, the court may consider any factors or considerations it deems proper under the circumstances. These might include whether
                        the person originally taking the defective corporate action believed that the action complied with corporate requirements, whether the corporation and board of directors has treated the defective corporate action as a valid action,
                        whether any person has acted in reliance on the public record that such defective corporate action was valid and whether any person will be or was harmed by the ratification of the defective corporate action or will be harmed by
                        the failure to ratify or validate the defective corporate action.

                    <p>
                        The only functions of incorporators under the Model Act are (1) to sign the articles of incorporation, (2) to deliver them for filing with the secretary of state, and (3) to complete the formation of the corporation to the extent set forth in section
                        2.05. One or more "persons" may serve as incorporator; "person" is defined in section 1.40 to include both individuals and entities; "entity" is also defined in that section to include corporations, unincorporated associations,
                        partnerships, trusts, estates, and governments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act also simplifies the formalities of execution and filing. The requirement in earlier versions of the Model Act and in many state statutes that articles be acknowledged or verified has been eliminated. Also, the requirement that "duplicate
                        originals" (each being executed as an original document) be submitted has been replaced with the requirement that a signed original and an "exact or conformed" copy be submitted. See the Official Comment to section 1.20.

                        A corporation will have perpetual duration unless a special provision is included in its articles of incorporation providing for a shorter period. See section 3.02. Similarly, a corporation with articles of incorporation which do not contain a purpose
                        clause will have the purpose of engaging in any lawful business under section 3.01(a). The option of providing a narrower purpose clause is also preserved in sections 2.02(b)(2)(i) and 3.01, with the effect described in the Official
                        Comment to section 3.01.

                    <p>
                        If a single class of shares is authorized, only the number of shares authorized need be stated; if more than one class of shares is authorized, however, both the number of authorized shares of each class and a description of the rights of each class must
                        be included. See the Official Comment to sections 6.01 and 6.02. It is unnecessary to specify par value, expected minimum capitalization, or contemplated issue price.

                    <p>
                        The corporation's initial registered office and agent must be included, and a mailing address alone, such as a post office box, is not sufficient since the registered office is the designated location for service of process. See chapter 5.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No reference need be made to a variety of other matters such as preemptive rights. See section 6.30 and its Official Comment. Generally, no substantive effect should be given tot he absence of a specific reference to such matters in section 2.02. They
                        are referred to in other sections of the Act that usually provide an "opt in" privilege. See particularly the list of optional provisions set forth in parts 4 and 5 of this Official Comment.

                    <p>
                        Section 2.02(b) allows the articles of incorporation to contain optional provisions deemed sufficiently important to be of public record or subject to amendment only by the processes applicable to amendments of articles of incorporation.

                        Section 2.02(c) makes in unnecessary to set forth any corporate powers in the articles of incorporation in view of the broad grant of power in section 3.02. This grant of power, however, may be overbroad for particular corporations; if so, it may be qualified
                        or narrowed by appropriate provisions in the articles of incorporation.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although par value is no longer a mandatory statutory concept under the Act, section 2.02(b)(b)(2)(iv) permits optional "par value" provisions with regard to shares. Other than being permitted by section 2.02(b)(b)(2)(iv), however, "par value" is not
                        mentioned in the Act. Special provisions may be included to give effect or meaning to "par value" essentially as a matter of contract between the parties. These provisions, whether appearing in the articles of incorporation or
                        in other documents, have only the effect any permissible contractual provision has in the absence of a prohibition by statute. Provision in the articles of incorporation establishing an optional par value may also be of use to
                        corporations which are to be qualified or registered in foreign jurisdictions that compute franchise or other taxes upon the basis of par value.

                    <p>
                        The basic tenet of corporation law is that shareholders are not liable for the corporation's liabilities by reason of their status as shareholders. Section 2.02(b)(b)(2)(iv) nevertheless permits a corporation to impose that liability under specified circumstances
                        if that is desirable. If no provision of this type is included, shareholders have no liability for corporate liabilities except to the extent they become liable by reason of their own conduct or acts. See section 6.22(b).
                    </p>

        E. LIMITATIONS OF DIRECTOR LIABILITY
       </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 2.02(b)(4) authorizes the inclusion of a provision in the articles of incorporation eliminating or limiting, with certain exceptions, the liability of the directors to the corporation or its shareholders for money damages. This section is optional
                        rather than self-executing and does not apply to equitable relief. Likewise, nothing in section 2.02(b)(4) in any way affects the right of the shareholders to remove directors, under section 8.08(a), with or without cause. The
                        phrase "as a director" emphasizes that section 2.02(b)(4) applies to a director's actions or failures to take action in the director's capacity as a director and not in any other capacity, such as officer, employee or controlling
                        shareholder. However, it is not intended to exclude coverage of conduct by individuals, even though they are also officers, employees or controlling shareholders, to the extent they are acting in their capacity as directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shareholders are given considerable latitude in limiting directors' liability for money damages. The statutory exceptions to permitted limitations of director liability are few and narrow and are discussed below.
                    </p>

        Financial Benefit
       </i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Corporate law subjects transactions from which a director could benefit personally to special scrutiny. The financial benefits exception is limited to the amount of the benefit actually received. Thus, liability for punitive damages could be eliminated,
                        except in cases of intentional infliction of harm or for violation of criminal law (as described below) where, in a particular case (for example, theft), punitive damages may be available. The benefit must be financial rather than
                        in less easily measured and more conjectural forms, such as business goodwill, personal reputation, or social ingratiation. The phrase "received by a director" is not intended to be a "bright line." As a director's conduct moves
                        toward the edge of what may be exculpated, the director should bear the risk of miscalculation. Depending upon the circumstances, a director may be deemed to have received a benefit that the director caused to be directed to another
                        person, for example, a relative, friend, or affiliate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What constitutes a financial benefit "to which the director is not entitled" is left to judicial development. For example, a director is entitled to reasonable compensation for the performance of services or to an increase in the value of stock or stock
                        options held by the director; on the other hand, a director is not entitled to a bribe, a kick-back, or the profits from a corporate opportunity improperly taken by the director. See section 8.70 as to procedures for disclaiming
                        the corporation's interest in a business opportunity by action of qualified directors or shareholders. See section 2.02(b)(6) for optional provisions permitted in the articles of incorporation to limit or eliminate, in advance,
                        any duty of directors and others to bring business opportunities to the corporation. If the corporation declines the opportunity after it has been presented to the corporation by the director in accordance with the provisions of
                        section 8.70(a)(1)(i) or (ii), or if a provision under section 2.02(b)(6) limits or eliminates the duty to bring the particular opportunity to the corporation, the corporation will have no right to participate in any financial
                        benefit arising from the opportunity if the director pursues or takes the opportunity.

                    <p>
                        There may be situations in which a director intentionally causes harm to the corporation even though the director does not receive any improper benefit. The use of the word "intentional," rather than a less precise term such as "knowing," is meant to
                        refer to the specific intent to perform, or fail to perform, the acts with actual knowledge that the director's action, or failure to act, will cause harm, rather than a general intent to perform the acts which cause the harm.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.32(a) indicates a strong policy in favor of liability for unlawful distributions approved by directors who have not complied with the standards of conduct of section 8.30. Accordingly, the exception in section 2.02(b)(4)(iii) prohibits the shareholders
                        from eliminating or limiting the liability of directors for a violation of section 8.32.

                        Even though a director committing a crime may intend to benefit the corporation, the shareholders should not be permitted to exculpate the director for any harm caused by an intentional violation of criminal law, including, for example, fines and legal
                        expenses of the corporation in defending a criminal prosecution. The use of the word "intentional," rather than a less precise term such as "knowing," is meant to refer to the specific intent to perform, or fail to perform, the
                        acts with actual knowledge that the director's action, or failure to act, constitutes a violation of criminal law.

        F. DIRECTOR IDEMNIFICATION
       </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 2.02(b)(5) specifically prohibits provisions for indemnification of director liability arising out of improper financial benefit received by a director, an intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the shareholders, an unlawful distribution
                        or an intentional violation of criminal law. These excepted liabilities parallel those a corporation is not permitted to limit or eliminate under section 2.02(b)(4). See "E. Limitations of Director Liability" above. Officers are
                        not included in the language of section 2.02(b)(5) because the expansion of indemnification for directors that section permits must be set forth in the articles of incorporation as required by section 8.51(a)(2); section 8.56 allows
                        a similar expansion of indemnification for officers to be set forth also in the bylaws, resolutions or contracts.

       </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 2.02(b)(6) authorizes the inclusion of a provision in the articles of incorporation to limit or eliminate, in advance, the duty of a director or other person to bring a business opportunity to the corporation. The limitation or elimination may
                        be blanket in nature and apply to any business opportunities, or it may extend only to one or more specified classes or categories of business opportunities. The adoption of such a provision constitutes a curtailment of the duty
                        of loyalty which includes the doctrine of corporate opportunity. If such a provision is included in the articles, taking advantage of a business opportunity covered by the provision of the articles without offering it to the corporation
                        will not expose the director or other person to whom it is made applicable either to monetary damages or to equitable or any other relief in favor of the corporation upon compliance with the requirements of section 2.02(b)(6).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This provision may be useful, for example, in the context of a private equity investor that wishes to have a nominee on the board but conditions its investment on an advance limitation or elimination of the corporate opportunity doctrine because of the
                        uncertainty over the application of the corporate opportunity doctrine inherent when investments are made in multiple enterprises in specific industries. Another example is a joint venture in corporate form where the participants
                        in the joint venture want to be sure that the corporate opportunity doctrine would not apply to their activities outside the joint venture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The focus of the advance limitation or elimination is on the duty of the director which extends indirectly to the investor through the application of the related party definition in section 8.60. This provision also permits extension of the limitation
                        or elimination of the duty to any other persons who might be deemed to have a duty to offer business opportunities to the corporation. For example, courts have held that the corporate opportunity doctrine extends to officers of
                        the corporation. Although officers may be included in a provision under this subsection, the limitation or elimination of corporate opportunity obligations of officers must be addressed by the board of directors in specific cases
                        or by the directors' authorizing provisions in employment agreements or other contractual arrangements with such officers. Accordingly, section 2.02(b)(6) requires that the application of an advance limitation or elimination of
                        the duty to offer a business opportunity to the corporation to any person who is an officer of the corporation or a related person of an officer also requires action by the board of directors acting through qualified directors.
                        This action must be taken subsequent to the inclusion of the provision in the articles of incorporation and may limit the application. This means that if the advance limitation or elimination of the duty of an officer to offer
                        business opportunities to the corporation is included in the articles by an amendment recommended by the directors and approved by the shareholders, that recommendation of the directors does not serve as the required authorization
                        by qualified directors; rather, separate authorization by qualified directors after the amendment is included in the articles is necessary to apply the provision to a particular officer or any related person of that officer. See
                        sections 1.43(a)(1) and 8.60 for the definition of "qualified directors" and "related persons," respectively.

                        Whether a provision for advance limitation or elimination of duty in the articles of incorporation should be a broad "blanket" provision or one more tailored to specific categories or classes of transactions deserves careful consideration given the particular
                        circumstances of the corporation.

                        Limitation or elimination of the duty of a director or officer to present a business opportunity to the corporation does not limit or eliminate the director's or officer's duty not to make unauthorized use of corporate property or information or to compete
                        unfairly with the corporation.

                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified by inserting a cross-reference in subdivision (a)(2) for clarity and by revising subdivision (a)(3) to require more specific information regarding the corporation's address and registered office.

                    <p>
                        In addition, the Model Act was modified to add more optional provisions available for articles of incorporation, including a limitation on duration (subdivision (b)(2)(vi)) and a provision limiting or eliminating the personal liability of directors in
                        certain circumstances (subsection (b)(3)), which existed under former G.S. 55-7(2) and (11). The phrase "not made in good faith" in former G.S. 55-7(11)(i) was deleted solely because it was thought to be redundant.

                        Corporation Held Limited to Objects Stated. - A charter of incorporation creating a company for the purpose of effecting a communication by a plank-road between designated points, with the privilege of taking tolls, did not authorize the company to establish
                        a stage line upon their road, nor to contract for carrying the United States mail. Wiswell v. Greenville Plank-Road Co., <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. 183</cite> (1857).

                    <p>
                        Use of All Powers Not Required. - The fact that a corporation avails itself of only one of several privileges granted by its charter does not invalidate the act of incorporation. Wadesboro Cotton Mills Co. v. Burns, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 353</cite>,
                        19 S.E. 238 (1894).

                    <p>
                        Limit of Corporate Existence. - A corporation whose term of existence is fixed and limited in the act which creates it cannot endure beyond the prescribed time, unless its existence is prolonged by the same authority or continued for the purpose of adjusting
                        and closing its business, and no judicial proceedings are required to terminate it. Asheville Div. No. 15 v. Aston, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 578</cite> (1885).

                    <p>
                        De Jure and De Facto Existence. - A corporation de jure is said to exist when persons holding a charter have made substantial compliance with the provisions of the same, looking to its proper organization, while a corporation de facto is one where the
                        parties having a charter or law authorizing it have in good faith made a colorable compliance with such requirements, and have proceeded in the exercise of the corporate powers or a part of them. Wood v. Staton,

                        Existence of a corporation may be proved by reputation. Existence or nonexistence is a fact and may be proved as other facts. Gulf States Steel Co. v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 195</cite>, 91 S.E. 844 (1917).

                        Proof of Existence by Written Contract. - Where a written contract entered into between the parties furnishes evidence that the defendant was dealing with the plaintiff as a corporation, and the plaintiff's existence as a corporation is denied, the contract
                        may properly be introduced upon this disputed fact. Otis Elevator Co. v. Cape Fear Hotel Co., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 319</cite>, 90 S.E. 253 (1916).

                        Copies of Letters of Incorporation as Proof of Existence. - Copies of letters of incorporation are admissible to show prima facie the existence of a corporation, and the corporation cannot avoid its liability for debts because in fact it had but an inchoate
                        existence. Marshall v. Macon County Bank, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 639</cite>, 13 S.E. 182 (1891).

        Exculpatory Clause.
       </b> - Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-Receiver (FDIC-R) argued only that the evidence suggested that the Director Appellees took actions harmful to the bank, in part by making decisions without adequate information;
                        this was insufficient. The exculpatory clause protected directors from monetary liability unless the directors "knew or believed that their acts or omissions were clearly in conflict" with the bank's best interests; actions that
                        might have been harmful or decisions that could have been better made did not rise to the level of bad faith in this context, especially in light of the fact that the bank received "CAMELS" scores of "2" from both of its regulators
                        despite the Director Appellees' actions. FDIC v. Rippy, 799 F.3d 301 (4th Cir. 2015).

                        Section 2.03(a) provides that the existence of a corporation begins when the articles of incorporation are filed, unless a delayed effective date is specified under section 1.23. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a></cite>                        contains detailed rules for the filing and effective dates of documents, all of which are applicable to articles of incorporation and other documents.

                            Conclusiveness of secretary of state's action on question of individual liability for corporate actions
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.20 requires that only one executed original and an exact or conformed copy of the articles need be delivered to the secretary of state for filing. This delivery must be accompanied by the applicable filing fee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.25 provides that the secretary of state files the articles by stamping them "filed" and recording the date and time of receipt; he then retains the signed original articles of incorporation for his records and returns the exact or conformed
                        copy to the incorporators along with a receipt for the fee. The return of this copy and the fee receipt establishes that the articles have been filed in the form of the copy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 1.25 provides that approval by the secretary of state is in the form of return of the copy of the articles with a fee receipt rather than a certificate of incorporation, as was the older practice still followed in many states. See the Official
                        Comment to section 1.25.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 2.03(a) ties the precise time of incorporation to the date and time stamped on the articles. Section 1.23 provides in turn that this is the date and time the articles are received by the secretary of state; in other words, consistent with the
                        practice of many secretaries of state, processing time is ignored and the date and time of receipt of the articles are the date and time of incorporation. The creators of the corporation may, however, specify that the corporation's
                        existence will begin on a later date than the date of filing, and at a precise time on such a date, to the extent permitted by section 1.23.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 2.03(b) the filing of the articles of incorporation as evidenced by return of the stamped copy of the articles with the fee receipt is conclusive proof that all conditions precedent to incorporation have been met, except in proceedings brought
                        by the state. Thus the filing of the articles of incorporation is conclusive as to the existence of limited liability for persons who enter into transactions on behalf of the corporation. If articles of incorporation have not been
                        filed, section 2.04 generally imposes personal liability on all persons who prematurely act as or on behalf of a "corporation" knowing that articles have not been filed. Section 2.04 may protect some of these persons to a limited
                        extent, however; see the Official Comment to that section.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Following incorporation, the organization of new corporation must be completed so that it may engage in business. This usually requires adoption of bylaws, the appointment of officers and agents, the raising of equity capital by the issuance of shares
                        to the participants in the venture, and the election of directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier versions of the Model Act required initial directors to be named in the articles and provided that they complete the organization of the corporation. Many states followed this pattern, but others provided that the incorporators organize the corporation
                        or meet to elect a board of directors to organize the corporation. The goal of all these provisions was usually to permit the completion of the organization of the corporation with minimum expense and formality, though in many
                        cases it was felt necessary for business decisions to be made at an early stage by the persons with responsibility for business operation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Experience in states followed the Model Act pattern revealed that multiple organizational meetings were often necessary, particularly where for reasons of convenience or secrecy both the incorporators and initial directors were "dummies" without any financial
                        interest in the enterprise who were not expected to make any significant business decisions. In this situation, the initial directors formally organized the corporation, including issuing of at least some shares; immediately following
                        this organizational meeting, the new shareholders met to elect a permanent board of directors who were to manage the business. In many instances, the permanent board of directors also had to meet immediately after its selection
                        by the shareholders to consider business questions that must be resolved promptly, such as authorization of employment contracts or the valuation of property or services to be accepted as consideration for shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 2.05 simplifies the formation process by allowing alternative methods of completing the formation of the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, section 2.05(a)(1) contemplates that if the draftsman elects to set forth the names of the initial directors in the articles of incorporation, the persons so named will organize the corporation. It is expected that initial directors will be named
                        only if they will be the permanent board of directors and there is no objection to the disclosure of their identity in the articles of incorporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Second, section 2.05(a)(2) provides alternative methods for completing the organization of the corporation if initial directors are not named in the articles of incorporation. The incorporators may themselves complete the organization, or they may simply
                        meet to elect a board of directors who are then to complete the organization. It is contemplated that in routine incorporations, the first alternative will be elected, while in more complex situations when prompt business decisions
                        must be made, the second alternative will be chosen and the completion of the organization will be turned over to the board of directors representing the investment interests in the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 2.05(b) and (c) are limited to meetings of incorporators since sections 8.21 and 8.22 permit the same actions by the board of directors. If a meeting of shareholders is necessary, sections 7.01 and 7.04 give them the same flexibility that is
                        given incorporators under sections 2.05(b) and (c).

                        The responsibility for adopting the original bylaws is placed on the person or persons completing the organization of the corporation.

                    <p>
                        Section 2.06(b) restates the accepted scope of bylaw provisions. For a list of Model Act provisions that become effective only if specific reference is made to them in the bylaws, see the Official Comment to section 2.02. Provisions set forth in bylaws
                        may additionally be contained in shareholder or board resolutions unless this Act requires them to be set forth in the bylaws.

                        The power to amend or repeal bylaws, or adopt new bylaws after the formation of the corporation is completed, is addressed in sections 10.20 through 10.22 of the Model Act.

                        The Model Act's use of the word "shall" in subsection (a) requires that a corporation have bylaws, whereas, under prior law, the adoption of bylaws was at least theoretically optional. Use of the word "shall," however, is not intended to imply that a
                        North Carolina corporation not adopting bylaws is not a valid corporation.

                    <p>
                        Section 2.07 is no longer an optional provision (as was the case with its predecessor in earlier versions of the Model Act) but is unqualifiedly recommended for adoption. The problem it addresses is potentially present in every state and in every corporation,
                        and the widespread acceptance of the earlier provision to date by a number of states argues that it be uniformly adopted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The adoption of emergency bylaws in advance of an emergency not only clarifies lines of command and responsibility but also tends to ensure continuity of responsibility. The board of directors may be authorized by the emergency bylaws, for example, to
                        designate the officers or other persons, in order of seniority and subject to various conditions, who may be deemed to be directors during the emergency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "emergency" adopted by subsection (d) is broader than a nuclear disaster or attack on the United States. It includes any catastrophic event, such as an airplane crash or fire, that makes it difficult or impossible for a quorum of the
                        corporation's board of directors to be assembled. While there apparently has been no recent illustration of a public corporation facing such a catastrophic event, its possibility should not be ignored. In order to encourage corporations
                        to adopt emergency bylaws, section 2.07(c) broadly validates all corporate actions taken "in good faith" pursuant to them and immunizes all corporate directors, officers, employees, and agents from liability as a result of these
                        actions. The phrase "action taken in good faith in accordance with the emergency bylaws" has been substituted for "willful misconduct," the language of the earlier Model Act provision. This change is designed to conform the standard
                        for immunity here and elsewhere in the Model Act and represents no substantive change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A corporation that does not adopt emergency bylaws under this section may nevertheless exercise the powers described in section 3.03 in the event of an emergency as defined in section 2.07(d).

                        This section has no equivalent under prior law. The Model Act was rewritten in subsection (c) to clarify that the limitation on liability contained in that subsection is limited to liability arising by reason of action taken by special procedures under
                        emergency bylaws.

                        Section 3.01(a) provides that every corporation automatically has the purpose of engaging in any lawful business unless a narrower purpose is described in the articles of incorporation. The specification of an "any lawful business" clause has become so
                        nearly universal in states that permit the clause that no reason exists for treating it otherwise than as the norm for the "standard" corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The option of a narrower purpose clause is most likely to be elected only in situations where one or more participants in the corporation desire to limit or retain a check on the business operations of the corporation. The articles of incorporation may
                        limit lines of business in which the corporation may engage. It should be recognized, however, that the limited scope of the ultra vires concept in litigation between the corporation and outsiders means that a third person entering
                        into a transaction that violates the restrictions in the purpose clause may be able to enforce the transaction in accordance with its terms if he was unaware of the narrow purpose clause when he entered the transaction. See the
                        Official Comment to section 3.04.

                    <p>
                        Many corporations may also find it desirable to supplement a general purpose clause with an additional statement of business purposes. This may be necessary for licensing or for qualification purposes in some states.

                    <p>
                        Section 3.01(b) is designed to tie in the limitless lawful purpose corporation permitted by section 3.01(a) with the numerous state statutes that impose regulations or limitations on corporations formed to, or actually engaging in, certain lines of business.
                        These state statutes are of various types.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of these statutes, particularly those relating to banking and insurance, establish a separate incorporation process and incorporating agency. These special incorporating states may refer back to or incorporate by reference portions of the general
                        business corporation statute.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other regulatory statutes may permit incorporation under the general business corporation act if the corporation imposes restrictions or limitations in its articles of incorporation; these restrictions may relate to the business in which the corporation
                        may engage, its manner of internal governance, or the persons who may or may not be shareholders and participate in the venture. The language of section 3.01(b) is designed to cover all these multiple variations and is a substitute
                        for the narrower language "except for the purpose of banking or insurance" that appeared in earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states.

                        Traditionally, incorporation was not permitted at all for the purpose of practicing the learned professions - e.g., law, medicine, and dentistry - primarily because of the personal skills and confidential relationships between lawyer and client or physician
                        and patient. In the early 1960s, however, a significant movement toward incorporation of professionals surfaced as part of an effort by professionals to obtain employee federal tax benefits. Professionals hoped to form corporations
                        to conduct their practice as employees of the corporation rather than as independent entrepreneurs. Early efforts by professionals to form entities to conduct their practice (despite the lack of state statutory authority to incorporate)
                        met with opposition from the Internal Revenue Service. In 1960 the I.R.S. issued the "Kintner" regulations, which in effect provided that federal tax status would be determined on the basis of the organization's characterization
                        under state law. TREAS. REGS.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The law of corporations has always proceeded on the fundamental assumption that corporations are creations with limited power; such an assumption was articulated by the United States Supreme Court as early as 1804,
                        <i>
        Head &amp; Armory v. Providence Insurance Co.,
       </i> 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 127, 169 (1804), and appears never to have been seriously questioned as a judicial matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is clear that narrow and limited powers clauses are undesirable: they encourage litigation by bringing into question reasonable transactions that further the business and interests of the corporation and to the extent transactions are unauthorized,
                        may defeat valid and reasonable expectations. The history of the Model Act and of many state statutes in this area is largely one ensuring that corporate powers are broad enough to cover all reasonable business transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In developing section 3.02, serious consideration was given to whether there was a continued need for a long list of corporate powers or whether a general provision granting every corporation power to act to the same extent as an individual might be substituted.
                        Because of the long history of these powers, however, it was feared that no matter how broadly phrased a general provision might be, a court might conclude that some power might not exist because no specific reference to it was
                        made in the statute. It was also feared that cautious attorneys might begin to restore power clauses to articles of incorporation out of concern that a general clause of the type in question might not be interpreted literally.
                        Hence, the present language, which is similar to that included in the statutes of California and other states, was adopted. The general clause granting the corporation essentially the same powers as an individual is coupled with
                        a nonexclusive listing of powers, including the traditional power clauses that appear in many state statutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The general philosophy of section 3.02 is thus that corporations formed under the Model Act provisions should be automatically authorized to engage in all acts and have all powers that an individual may have. Because broad grants of power of this nature
                        may not be desired in some corporations, section 3.02 generally authorizes articles of incorporation to deny or limit specific powers to a specific corporation if that is felt desirable. This power to exclude specific powers does
                        not reflect a substantive change from earlier versions of the Model Act (which did not contain an express provision to this effect) but simply makes explicit what was always implicit. Illustrative of the powers that may be appropriate
                        for limitation in specific corporations are the powers (discussed below) to make political contributions to the extent permitted by law or to make expenditures to influence elections affecting the corporate business to the extent
                        permitted by law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The powers listed in section 3.02 were broadened in several significant respects:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li id="t55a03s55-3-02-officialcommentol11">
                            All limitations on loans to directors have been eliminated. The wisdom and propriety of these loans should be evaluated on the basis of general fiduciary standards and the benefits to the corporation. See sections 8.30, 8.31, and 8.32. Section 3.02(11)
                            thus rejects the conceptual argument that because certain transactions are subject to abuse, all such transactions should be prohibited.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t55a03s55-3-02-officialcommentol12">
                            It is made clear in section 3.02(12) that former as well as present directors, officers, employees, and agents may participate in pension, option, and similar benefit plans.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t55a03s55-3-02-officialcommentol13">
                            Section 3.02(15) permits payments or donations or other acts "that further the business and affairs of the corporation." This clause, which is in addition to and independent of the power to make charitable and similar donations under section 3.02(13),
                            permits contributions for purposes that may not be charitable, such as for political purposes or to influence elections. This power exists only to the extent consistent with law other than the Model Act. It is the purpose of
                            this section to authorize all corporate actions that are lawful or not against public policy.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The powers of a corporation under the Model Act exist independently of whether a corporation has a broad or narrow purpose clause. A corporation with a narrow purpose clause nevertheless has the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary
                        or convenient to carry out its business. Many actions are therefore intra vires even though they do not directly affect the limited purpose for which the corporation is formed. For example, a corporation may generally make charitable
                        contributions without regard to the purpose for which the charity will use the funds or may invest money in shares of other corporations without regard to whether the corporate purpose of the other corporation is broader or narrower
                        than the limited purpose clause of the investing corporation. In some instances, however, a limited or narrow purpose clause may be considered to be a restriction on corporate powers as well as a restriction on purposes. Since
                        the same ultra vires rule is applicable to corporations that exceed their purposes or powers (see the Official Comment to section 3.04), it is not necessary to determine whether a narrow purpose clause also limits the powers of
                        the corporation but simply whether the purpose of the transaction in question is consistent with the purpose clause. Of course, these issues cannot arise in corporations with an "any lawful business" purpose clause.

                        This section contains essentially all of the powers enumerated in former G.S. 55-17, but it avoids the distinction that the prior law made between unconditional powers and those exercisable by a corporation "only in connection with the purposes stated
                        in its charter," and lists all powers in a single sequence. The words "or this act" were added to the Model Act's introductory language in subsection (a) to emphasize that there may be limiting provisions elsewhere in
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>. Subdivision (a)(11) was modified to incorporate language from former G.S. 55-17(a)(4) that was believed to be less restrictive than
                        the Model Act's language, and subdivision (12) was modified by changing the Model Act's reference to "share" bonus and "share" option plans to the more commonly used terms, "stock" bonus and "stock" option plans. Subdivision (13)
                        was modified to add donations for religious and cultural purposes, which were permitted under former G.S. 55-17(a)(6). Subdivision (16) brings forward former G.S. 55-17(b) (4), and is more specific than the Model Act in authorizing
                        insurance on the corporation's directors, officers, employees and security holders.
                    </p>

                        In addition, former G.S. 55-17(c) was added to this section as subsection (b) to avoid any negative inference by its omission. It does not appear in the Model Act.

                            after it comes into existence, adopt such contract by its corporate action, which adoption may be express or implied, and thereby become liable for its performance. Smith v. Ford Motor Co.,

                            Property of a corporation belongs to it, not to the stockholders. They only have an interest in such property through their relation to the company, and in this respect the State is like any other stockholder. Marshall v. Western N.C.R.R.,

                            Where the State is a stockholder in a railroad company, it is bound by the provisions of the charter in the same manner as an individual. It has no advantage as a stockholder on account of its sovereignty, for, by becoming such, it lays aside its character
                            as a sovereign and places itself on a footing of equality with the individual stockholders. Marshall v. Western N.C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 322</cite> (1885).

                            Necessity for Authorization by Directors to Sell Corporate Property. - Corporate directors are trustees of the corporation's property, and usually a corporation may sell, transfer, and convey its corporate real estate only when authorized to do so by
                            its board of directors. And statutory provisions may be supplemented by stipulation in the corporation's bylaws. Tuttle v. Junior Bldg. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 507</cite>, 46 S.E.2d

                            In the absence of charter provisions or bylaws to the contrary, the president of a corporation is the general manager of its corporate affairs, and his contracts made in the name of the corporation in the general course of business and within the apparent
                            scope of his authority are ordinarily enforceable, but ordinarily he has no power to sell or contract to sell the real or personal property of the corporation without authority from its board of directors. Tuttle v. Junior

                    <p>
                        Section 3.03 should be read in conjunction with section 2.07, which authorizes a corporation to adopt emergency or standby bylaws. Section 3.03 grants every corporation limited powers to act in an emergency even though it has failed to enact emergency
                        bylaws under section 2.07.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An "emergency" for purposes of section 3.03 is defined in subsection (d) as any catastrophic event that makes it difficult or impossible to assemble a quorum of directors. In this situation, section 3.03(b) dispenses with or relaxes notice requirements
                        and permits corporate officers to serve as directors in order to achieve a quorum. The section also authorizes the board of directors, either before or during an emergency, to modify lines of succession and relocate the principal
                        business office of the corporation. These actions may be taken only by the board of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present after giving effect, if necessary, to section 3.03(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These minimal provisions, it is believed, should permit a corporation to continue to function in the face of an emergency even if no emergency bylaws have been adopted under section 2.07.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The basic purpose of section 3.04 - as has been the purpose of all similar statutes during the 20th century - is to eliminate all vestiges of the doctrine of inherent incapacity of corporations. See Campbell, "The Model Business Corporation Act," 11-4
                        BUS. LAW. 98, 102 (1956). Under this section it is unnecessary for persons dealing with a corporation to inquire into limitations on its purposes or powers that may appear in its articles of incorporation. A person who is unaware
                        of these limitations when dealing with the corporation is not bound by them. The phrase in section 3.04(a) that the "validity of corporate action may not be challenged on the ground that the corporation lacks or lacked power to
                        act" applies equally to the use of the doctrine as a sword or as a shield: a third person may no more avoid an undesired contract with a corporation on the ground the corporation was without authority to make the contract than
                        a corporation may defend a suit on a contract on the ground that the contract is ultra vires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The language of section 3.04 extends beyond contracts and conveyances of property; "corporate action" of any kind cannot be challenged on the ground of ultra vires. For this reason it makes no difference whether a limitation in articles of incorporation
                        is considered to be a limitation on a purpose or a limitation on a power; both are equally subject to section 3.04. Corporate action also includes inaction or refusal to act. The common law of ultra vires distinguished between
                        executory contracts, partially executed contracts, and fully executed ones; section 3.04 treats all corporate action the same - except to the extent described in section 3.04(b) - and the same rules apply to all contracts no matter
                        at what stage of performance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 3.04, however, does not validate corporate conduct that is made illegal or unlawful by statute or common law decision. This conduct is subject to whatever sanction, criminal or civil, that is provided by the statute or decision. Whether or not
                        illegal corporate conduct is voidable or rescindable depends on the applicable statute or substantive law and is not affected by section 3.04.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 3.04 also does not address the validity of essentially intra vires conduct that is not approved by appropriate corporate action. It does not deal, for example, with the enforceability of an executory contract to sell substantially all the assets
                        of a corporation not in the ordinary course of business that was not approved by the shareholders as required by section 12.02. This type of transaction is not beyond the purposes or powers of the corporation; it simply has not
                        been approved by the corporate authorities as required by law. Similarly, section 3.04 does not deal with whether a corporation is bound by the action of a corporate agent if the action requires, but has not received, approval
                        by the board of directors. Whether or not the corporation is bound by this action depends on the law of agency, particularly the scope of apparent authority and whether the third person knew or should have known of the defect in
                        the corporate approval process. These actions may be ultra vires with respect to the agent's authority but they are not ultra vires with respect to the corporation and are not controlled by section 3.04.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, corporate action is not ultra vires under section 3.04 merely because it constitutes a breach of fiduciary duty. For example, a misuse of corporate assets for personal purposes by an officer or director is a breach of fiduciary duty and may
                        be enjoined. Similarly, in some circumstances a lien on corporate assets and a contract entered into by the corporation may be cancelled or enjoined if they constitute breaches of fiduciary duty and the third person is charged
                        with knowledge that they were improper. These transactions, however, are not ultra vires with respect to the corporation, and cannot be attacked under section 3.04. They may be enjoined because of breach of the fiduciary duty,
                        not because the transaction exceeds the powers or purposes of the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 3.04(b), like the prior Model Act provisions, permits challenges to the corporation's lack of power in three limited classes of cases:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li id="t55a03s55-3-04-officialcommentol11">
                            In suits by the attorney general under section 14.30. This provision does not answer the question whether or not a corporation may be dissolved or enjoined by the attorney general for committing an ultra vires act; it simply preserves the power of the
                            state to assert that certain corporate action was ultra vires.
                        </li>

                            In a suit by the corporation, either directly or through a legal representative, against incumbent or former officers or directors for authorizing or causing the corporation to engage in an ultra vires act. Again, this section does not address whether
                            or not there is liability for causing the corporation to enter into an ultra vires act; it simply preserves the power of the corporation to assert that certain corporate action was ultra vires.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t55a03s55-3-04-officialcommentol13">
                            In a suit by a shareholder against the corporation to enjoin an ultra vires act. This suit, however, is subject to the requirements of section 3.04(c). Under this subsection an ultra vires act may be enjoyed only if all "affected parties" are parties
                            to the suit. The requirement that the action be "equitable" generally means that only third persons dealing with a corporation while specifically aware that the corporation's action was ultra vires will be enjoined. The general
                            phrase "if equitable" was retained because of the possibility that other circumstances may exist in which it may be equitable to refuse to enforce an ultra vires contract. Further, if enforcement of the contract is enjoined,
                            either the third person or the corporation may in the discretion of the court be awarded damages from the other for loss (excluding anticipated profits).

                    <p>
                        Section 3.04(c) thus authorizes a court to enjoin or set aside an ultra vires act or grant other relief that may be necessary to protect the interests of all affected persons, including the interests of third persons who deal with the corporation.

                        Doctrine of ultra vires has been very much modified, and many contracts made in the course of business, especially when executed and benefits are received or liabilities are incurred, will be upheld and enforced which were once declared absolutely void.

                        The articles of incorporation must prescribe the classes of shares and the number of shares of each class that the corporation is authorized to issue. If more than one class of shares is authorized, the articles of incorporation must prescribe a distinguishing
                        designation for each class, and, prior to the issuance of shares of a class, the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of that class must be described in the articles of incorporation. All shares of a class must have preferences,
                        limitations, and relative rights identical with those of other shares of the same class unless the articles of incorporation divide a class into series. If a class is divided into series, all the shares of any one series must have

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.01 adopts a new terminology from that traditionally used in corporation statutes to describe classes of shares that may be created, but makes only limited substantive changes from earlier versions of the Model Act. Traditional corporation statutes
                        work from a perceived inheritance of concepts of "common shares" and "preferred shares" that at one time may have had considerable meaning but that today often do not involve significant distinctions. It is possible under modern
                        corporation statutes to create classes of "common" shares that have important preferential rights and classes of "preferred" shares that are subordinate in all important economic aspects or that are indistinguishable from common
                        shares in either voting rights or entitlement to participate in the assets of the corporation upon dissolution. The revised Model Act breaks away from the inherited concepts of "common" and "preferred" shares and develops more
                        general language to reflect the actual flexibility in the creation of classes of shares that exists in modern corporate practice. The words "common shares" or "preferred shares" are no longer used in the revised Model Act, though
                        the words appear in a few instances in examples appearing in the Official Comment.

                        Section 6.01(a) requires that the articles of incorporation prescribe the classes of shares and the number of shares of each class that the corporation is authorized to issue. If the articles authorize the issue of only one class of shares, no designation
                        or description of the shares is required, it being understood that these shares have both the power to vote and the power to receive the net assets of the corporation upon dissolution. See section 6.01(b). Shares with both of these
                        characteristics are usually referred to as "common shares" or "common stock," but no specific designation is required by the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If more than one class of shares is authorized, the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of each class of shares must be described in the articles of incorporation before any shares of that class are issued, or the board of directors may be given
                        authority to establish them under section 6.02. These descriptions constitute the "contract" of the holders of those classes of shares with respect to their interest in the corporation and must be set forth in sufficient detail
                        reasonably to define their interest. The designations, preferences, limitations, and relative rights of shares with one or more special or preferential rights which may be authorized are further described in section 6.01(c).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If more than one class is authorized (or if only one class is originally authorized but at some future time one or more other classes of shares are added by amendment), the preferences, limitations, and relative rights of each class or classes of shares,
                        including the class or classes that possess the fundamental characteristics of voting and residual equity financial interests, must be described before shares of those classes are issued. If both fundamental characteristics are
                        placed exclusively in a single class of shares, that class may be described simply as "common shares" or by statements such as the "shares have general distribution and voting rights," the "shares have all the rights of common
                        shares," or the "shares have all rights not granted to the class A shares."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the articles of incorporation create classes of shares that divide these fundamental rights among two or more classes of shares, it is necessary that the rights be clearly allocated among the classes. Specificity is required only to the extent necessary
                        to differentiate the relative rights of the respective classes. For example, where one class has a liquidation preference over another, it is necessary to specify only the preferential liquidation right of that class; in the absence
                        of a contrary provision in the articles, the remaining class would be entitled to receive the net assets remaining after the liquidation preference has been satisfied.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More than one class of shares may be designated as "common shares;" however, each must have a "distinguishing designation" under section 6.01(a), e.g., "nonvoting common shares" or "class A common shares," and the rights of the classes must be described.
                        For example, if a corporation authorizes two classes of shares with equal rights to share in all distributions and with identical voting rights except that one class is entitled exclusively to elect one director and the second
                        class is entitled exclusively to elect a second director, the two classes may be designated, e.g., as "Class A common" and "Class B common," and described, e.g., as "a class of common shares with the right to elect one director."
                        What is required is language that makes the location of these rights clear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rather than describing the terms of each class of shares in the articles of incorporation, the corporation may delegate to the board of directors under section 6.02 the power to establish the terms of a class of shares (or of a series within a class of
                        shares (if no shares of that class (or series) have previously been issued. Those terms, however, must be set forth in an amendment to the articles of incorporation before the shares are issued.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.01(b) requires that every corporation authorize one or more classes of shares that have the two fundamental characteristics of having unlimited voting rights and the right to receive the net assets of the corporation upon its dissolution. These
                        two fundamental characteristics need not be placed in a single class of shares but may be divided as desired. It is nevertheless essential that the corporation always have authorized shares with these two characteristics, and section
                        6.03 requires that shares having in the aggregate these characteristics always be outstanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.01(b) ensures that there is always in existence one or more classes of shareholders who share in the ultimate residual interest in the corporation and who are entitled to elect a board of directors and make other fundamental decisions with respect
                        to the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.01(c) lists the principal features that are customarily incorporated into classes of shares. Section 6.01(d) makes clear that this listing is not exhaustive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.01(c) authorizes creation of classes of shares with limited or residual rights without significant limitation. In earlier versions of the Model Act and in the statutes of many states, certain types of rights or privileges are not permitted.
                        Many such statutes, for example, prohibit the creation of a class of voting shares without preferential financial rights that is callable at the discretion of the corporation ("callable common shares"). Another common prohibition
                        is against shares that have the power to be converted at the option of the shareholder into other classes of shares that have preferential financial rights, or into debt securities of the corporation ("upstream" conversion privileges).
                        For the reasons set forth below, these restrictions are not preserved in the revised Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any class of shares may be granted multiple or fractional votes per share without limitation. See section 7.21. Shares of any class may also be made nonvoting "except to the extent prohibited by this Act." This "except" clause refers to the provisions
                        in the Model Act that permit shares that are designated to be nonvoting to vote as separate voting groups on amendments to articles of incorporation and other organic changes in the corporation that directly affect that class (sections
                        7.26 and 10.04). In addition, shares may be given voting rights that are limited or conditional (e.g., on the passing of a specified number of dividends). Section 6.01(b), however, requires that there always be one or more classes
                        of shares that together have unlimited voting rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.01(c)(2) permits classes of shares to be made redeemable on the terms set forth in the articles of incorporation. Under this section, shares may be made "redeemable" at the option of the holder, the corporation, or another person; shares redeemable
                        at the option of the corporation are sometimes called "callable shares," while shares redeemable at the option of the shareholder are sometimes described as involving a "put." The Model Act permits either type of redemption for
                        any class of shares and thereby permits the creation of redeemable or callable shares without limitation (subject only to the provisos that the class or classes of shares described in section 6.01(b) must always exist and that
                        at least one share of each class with those rights or powers must be outstanding under section 6.03).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states contain a direct or indirect prohibition against callable voting shares or callable common shares. Even where such a prohibition exists, however, the same effect can be obtained by the
                        use of consensual share transfer restrictions (see section 6.27). If it is possible to create what is essentially a callable voting share by agreement, there is no reason why such provisions should not be built directly and publicly
                        into the capital structure of the corporation if that is desired.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The recognition of a redemption that is a "put" exercisable by the holders of the shares (or a third person such as holders of other classes of shares) is also new to the Model Act and is not permitted in many states. However, consensual share transfer
                        restrictions may create a right that is indistinguishable from such a right of redemption, and a right of redemption is expressly recognized by many states in connection with certain specialized classes of corporations such as
                        open-end investment companies. As described below, if a right of redemption is recognized, prohibitions in earlier versions of the Model Act and many state statutes against "upstream" conversions serve no purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The amount to be paid upon the redemption of shares under section 6.01(c)(2) may be fixed in the articles of incorporation or "determined in accordance with a designated formula or by reference to extrinsic data or events." The reference to "extrinsic
                        data or events" is intended to permit the redemption price to be established on the basis of matters external to the corporation, such as the purchase price of other shares, the level of the prime rate, the effective interest rate
                        at which the corporation may obtain short- or long-term financing, the consumer price index or a designated currency ratio. While a designated price formula or references must be set out in the articles of incorporation, the board
                        of directors may be given limited authority to implement the provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All redemptions of shares are subject to the restrictions on distributions set forth in section 6.40. See section 6.03(b).

                    <p>
                        Section 6.01(c)(2) also permits shares of any class to be made convertible into shares of any other class or into cash, indebtedness, securities, or other property of the corporation or another person.

                        As described above, earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states prohibit so-called "upstream" conversions, that is, shares convertible into debt securities or into a class of shares having prior or superior preference rights. See,
                        e.g., N.Y. BUS. CORP. LAW ANN.

        §
       </span> 519(a)(1) (McKinney 1963). This restriction was eliminated from the Model Act since it was recognized that the power to make shares redeemable at the option of the shareholder for cash (see section 6.01(c)(2)(ii))
                        should logically permit the shares to be redeemable or convertible at the option of the shareholder into other shares with senior preferential rights. Creditors of the corporation and holders of shares with preferential rights
                        are less seriously affected by a conversion of shares into debt or into shares with preferential rights than they would be by the redemption of the shares for money, which is permitted by the revised Model Act, subject to the limitations
                        of section 6.40. Shares made "redeemable" for debt under section 6.01(c)(2)(ii), achieve the same effect as a right to "convert" shares into debt securities.

                        Section 6.01 authorizes the creation of new or innovative classes of shares without limitation or restriction. The section is basically enabling rather than restrictive since corporations often find it necessary to create new and innovative classes of
                        shares for a variety of reasons, and with the disclosure of the terms of the new classes in the articles of incorporation that are a matter of public record there is no reason to restrict the power to create these classes. Innovative
                        classes of shares may be created in connection with raising debt or equity capital. Securities with novel provisions are often created to meet perceived corporate needs in specific circumstances or because of financial problems
                        generated by market conditions for capital. Novel classes of shares may also be created in order to effectuate desired control relationships among the participants in a venture. Classes of shares are likely to be used for this
                        purpose in closely held corporations, whether or not statutory close corporation status is elected, but may also be used for this purpose by publicly held corporations.

                        A corporation has power to issue debt securities under section 3.02(7). Although section 6.01 authorizes the creation of interests that usually will be classed as "equity" rather than "debt," it is permissible to create classes of securities under section
                        6.01 that have some of the characteristics of debt securities. These securities are often referred to as "hybrid securities." Section 6.01 of the Model Act does not limit the development of hybrid securities, and equity securities
                        may be created under the Model Act that embody any characteristics of debt that may be desired. Unlike some state statutes, however, the Model Act restricts the power to vote to securities classed as "shares" in the articles of
                        incorporation.

                        The Model Act was modified in this section to deal only with the kind of shares that are authorized and, in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a06s55-6-02" target="_self">G.S. 55-6-02</a></cite>, to deal only with blank shares where
                        the board of directors fixes or determines the terms of a series within a class of shares. The Model Act blends these provisions by providing the authority to issue a series within a class in section 6.02 instead of section 6.01.
                        Subsection (a) of this section incorporates subsection (b) of section 6.02 of the Model Act, slightly modified for clarity, while subsection (c) of section 6.02 was incorporated as subsection (b) of this section.

                        Preferred stock forms a part of the capital stock of the corporation, entitling the holders to all rights of the stockholder subject to the terms and conditions on which their stock was issued. Kistler v. Caldwell Cotton Mills Co.,

                        Priorities of preferred stock are always subject to the rights of creditors. So an attempt of the corporation to give the preferred stockholders a lien upon its realty in the nature of a mortgage or deed of trust under the provisions of its charter is
                        ineffectual as to the prior rights of creditors. Ellington v. Raleigh Bldg. Supply Co., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 784</cite>, 147 S.E. 307 (1929).

                    <p>
                        Section 6.02 permits the board of directors, if authority to do so is contained in the articles, to fix the terms of a class of shares to meet corporate needs, including current requirements of the securities market or the exigencies of negotiations for
                        acquisition of other corporations or properties, without the necessity of holding a shareholders' meeting to amend the articles. This section therefore permits prompt action and gives desirable flexibility. The articles of incorporation
                        may also create "series" of shares within a class (rather than designating that "series" as a separate class) if that is deemed desirable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The board of directors may create new series within a class or set the terms of a class or series only if there are no outstanding shares of that class or series. This section recognizes that in some contexts there is no substantive difference between
                        a "class" and a "series within a class," and that the labels are often a matter of convenience. In appropriate circumstances, a series may be treated as a class of shares that has one or both of the fundamental characteristics
                        described in section 6.01(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shares of stock to be issued in different classes or series that vary in terms to be set by the board of directors are sometimes referred to as "blank stock." The granting of the power to vary the terms gives the board of directors broad power to affect
                        the capital structure of the corporation. Exercise of this power may in some circumstances dilute the interest of existing shareholders. But on balance it is desirable to permit this flexibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The power to vary the terms of "blank stock" for series of the same class extends to all the permitted variables set forth in section 6.01(c).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (e) requires a simple official filing to amend the articles so there will be a public record of the class or series the corporation intends to issue. The amendment may be made without shareholder action. See section 10.02.

                        Section 6.03 permits the corporation to issue shares up to the number of shares authorized in the articles of incorporation and provides that shares that are issued are outstanding shares for purposes of this Act until they are reacquired, redeemed, converted,
                        or cancelled. The determination of the number of shares to be issued is usually made by the board of directors but may be reserved by the articles of incorporation to the shareholders. The only requirements are that no class of
                        shares be overissued and that one or more shares of a class or classes that together have unlimited voting power and one or more shares of a class or classes that together are entitled to the net assets of the corporation upon
                        dissolution at all times must be outstanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shares of any class that are outstanding may be made subject to share transfer restrictions that may result in contractual obligations by the corporation to reacquire shares. The validity of such share transfer restriction is today not open to serious
                        question. See section 6.27. The corporation may also acquire outstanding shares of any class pursuant to a voluntary transaction between the shareholder and the corporation. All contractual or voluntary reacquisitions are subject
                        to the restrictions set forth in subsection (c) of this section and to section 6.40. The corporation may also reacquire shares pursuant to a right of redemption (or an obligation to redeem) established in the articles of incorporation.
                        See section 6.01(c)(2). All such redemptions of shares are also subject to the restrictions of subsection (c) of this section and to section 6.40. Shares of the class or classes described in section 6.01(b) may be reacquired or
                        redeemed by the corporation in any of the foregoing ways to the same extent as shares of any other class, subject, however, to the overriding requirement of section 6.03(c) that at all times at least shares that meet the requirements
                        of section 6.01(b) be outstanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of the revised Model Act are consistent with the specialized class of corporation known as the open-end investment company, which permits unlimited redemptions of shares at net asset value at the request of shareholders. Sections 6.01 and
                        6.03 permit the classes of shares with voting and dissolution rights to be made redeemable without limitation. The requirement of section 6.03(c) that at least one share be outstanding is also consistent with an unlimited right
                        of redemption since that section only applies while there are shares of stock outstanding. If an open-end investment company or any other corporation should redeem all of its outstanding shares, it should file articles of dissolution
                        under chapter 14 at or before the time the last share is redeemed.

                        Fractional shares may arise from a share dividend that, as applied to a particular holder, does not produce an even multiple of shares; they may also result from fractional stock splits, from reverse splits, and from reclassifications and mergers. Although
                        corporations are authorized to issue fractional shares, which are vested proportionately with the same rights as full shares, the creation of fractional shares often creates administrative difficulties, particularly for voting
                        and dividend purposes.

                            The corporation may issue scrip instead of fractional shares. Scrip confers none of the substantive rights of shareholders, but only authorizes holders to combine scrip certificates in amounts aggregating a full share and then to exchange them for a full
                            share. This aggregation must occur within the time and subject to the conditions set initially by the board of directors and stated in the scrip certificate. Scrip that is not combined and exchanged becomes void. To protect
                            shareholders against forfeiture of their interest, however, it is usually provided that the shares represented by scrip certificates not exchanged by the expiration date are to be sold and the proceeds held, either indefinitely
                            or for a stated period, for the benefit of the scripholders and paid to them on surrender of their scrip certificate.

                            The corporation may authorize the immediate sale of all fractional share interests, thereby avoiding the expense and delay of scrip and the inconvenience of recognizing fractional shares. While this procedure denies shareholders the benefit of any subsequent
                            rise in the market, it protects them against any subsequent decline and ensures them of recognition based on market values contemporaneous with the transaction. Since these transactions necessarily involve less than one full
                            share for each shareholder, the amount involved in subsequent price changes is usually modest.

                        Scrip has been widely used in lieu of fractional shares. The New York Stock Exchange, while not requiring the use of any particular method for the settlement of fractional share interests, has established a policy relating to the minimum rights and privileges
                        that scrip issued by registered companies must provide. N.Y.S.E. LISTED COMPANY MANUAL

                        One variation of "going private" transactions to eliminate public shareholders in a corporation largely owned by management interests involves a reverse share split at a ratio that reduces all public shareholders' interest to a fractional share, followed
                        by the reduction of the fractional interests to cash under this section. See "Guidelines on Going Private," 37 BUS. LAW. 313 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Agreements for the purchase of shares to be issued by a corporation are typically referred to as "subscriptions" or "subscription agreements." Section 6.20 deals exclusively with preincorporation subscriptions, that is, subscriptions entered into before
                        the corporation was formed. Preincorporation subscriptions have often been considered to be revocable offers rather than binding contracts. Since the corporation is not in existence, it cannot be a party to the agreement and the
                        consideration established for the shares is not determined by the board of directors. While preincorporation subscriptions entered into simultaneously by several subscribers may be considered a binding contract between or among
                        the subscribers, not all factual situations lend themselves to contractual analysis. Because of the uncertainty of the legal enforceability of these transactions, section 6.20 provides a simple set of legal rules applicable to
                        the enforcement of preincorporation subscriptions by the corporation after its formation. It does not address the extent to which preincorporation subscriptions may constitute a contract between or among subscribers, and other
                        subscribers may enforce whatever contract rights they have without regard to section 6.20.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.20(a) provides that preincorporation subscriptions are irrevocable for six months unless the subscription agreement provides that they are revocable or that they are irrevocable for some other period. Nevertheless, all the subscribers to shares
                        may agree at any time that a subscriber may withdraw in part from his commitment to subscribe for shares, that a subscriber may revoke his subscription entirely, or that the period of irrevocability may continue for an additional
                        stated period. If the corporation accepts the subscription during the period of irrevocability, the subscription becomes a contract binding on both the subscribers and the corporation. The terms of this contract are set forth in

                        Section 6.20(b) provides that after incorporation the board of directors may determine the payment terms of subscriptions but these calls must be uniform so far as practicable as to all shares of the same class or series unless the subscriptions provide
                        otherwise. Section 6.20(d) provides alternative methods of enforcement of preincorporation subscriptions by the corporation. If the consideration for the subscription involves the payment of money or conveyance of property, the
                        corporation may, in the event of nonpayment, collect the amount due as any other debt. Alternatively, unless the subscription agreement provides otherwise, the corporation may rescind the agreement and may resell the shares after
                        20 days' notice to the subscriber.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.20(c) provides that shares issued pursuant to preincorporation subscriptions are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the subscription price. The liability of the subscriber to pay the purchase price is addressed in section
                        6.22. Section 6.20 does not address the liability of transferees of shares which may be issued before the subscription price is paid for the power of the corporation to cancel for nonpayment shares that have been issued before
                        payment for the full subscription price. Issued shares represented by unpaid subscriptions are subject to cancellation for nonpayment to the same extent as shares issued for promissory notes or shares issued before the consideration
                        therefor is paid. See the Official Comment to sections 6.21 and 6.22.

                        Post-incorporation subscriptions are contracts between the corporation and the investor by which the corporation agrees to issue shares for a stated consideration and the investor agrees to purchase the shares for that consideration. Post-incorporation
                        subscriptions are simple contracts subject to the power of the board of directors and they may contain any mutually acceptable provisions subject to section 6.21. Section 6.20(e) states, for completeness, that post-incorporation
                        subscriptions are contracts between the corporation and the subscriber subject to section 6.21.

                        The liquidated damages provision of former G.S. 55-43(i) was not brought forward. Under that provision, it was more disadvantageous for a subscriber to pay some money than to pay no money for shares under a subscription agreement, and the drafters concluded
                        that this result was undesirable.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    <p>
                        The financial provisions of the Model Act reflect a modernization of the concepts underlying the capital structure and limitations on distributions of corporations. This process of modernization began with amendments in 1980 to the 1969 Model Act that
                        eliminated the concepts of "par value" and "stated capital," and further modernization occurred in connection with the development of the revised Act in 1984. Practitioners and legal scholars have long recognized that the statutory
                        structure embodying "par value" and "legal capital" concepts is not only complex and confusing but also fails to serve the original purpose of protecting creditors and senior security holders from payments to junior security holders.
                        Indeed, to the extent security holders are led to believe that it provides this protection, these provisions may be affirmatively misleading. The Model Act has therefore eliminated these concepts entirely and substituted a simpler
                        and more flexible structure that provides more realistic protection to these interests. Major aspects of this new structure are:

                            the elimination of the concept of treasury shares described in the Official Comment to section 6.31.

                    <p>
                        Section 6.21 incorporates not only the elimination of the concepts of par value and stated capital from the Model Act in 1980 but also eliminates the earlier rule declaring certain kinds of property ineligible as consideration for shares. The caption
                        of the section, "Issuance of Shares by the Board of Directors," reflects the change in emphasis from imposing restrictions on the issuance of shares to establishing general principles for their issuance. The section replaces two
                        sections captioned, respectively, "Consideration for Shares" (section 18) and "Payment for Shares" (section 19) in the 1969 Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since shares need not have a par value, under section 6.21 there is no minimum price at which specific shares must be issued and therefore there can be no "watered stock" liability for issuing shares below an arbitrarily fixed price. The price at which
                        shares are issued is primarily a matter of concern to other shareholders whose interests may be diluted if shares are issued at unreasonably low prices or for overvalued property. This problem of equality of treatment essentially
                        involves honest and fair judgments by directors and cannot be effectively addressed by an arbitrary doctrine establishing a minimum price for shares such as "par value" provided under older statutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.21(b) specifically validates contracts for future services (including promoters' services), promissory notes, or "any tangible or intangible property or benefit to the corporation," as consideration for the present issue of shares. The term
                        "benefit" should be broadly construed to include, for example, a reduction of a liability, a release of a claim, or benefits obtained by a corporation by contribution of its shares to a charitable organization or as a prize in
                        a promotion. In the realities of commercial life, there is sometimes a need for the issuance of shares for contract rights or such intangible property or benefits. And, as a matter of business economics, contracts for future services,
                        promissory notes, and intangible property or benefits often have value that is as real as the value of tangible property or past services, the only types of property that many older statutes permit as consideration for shares.
                        Thus, only business judgment should determine what kind of property should be obtained for shares, and a determination by the directors meeting the requirements of section 8.30 to accept a specific kind of valuable property for
                        shares should be accepted and not circumscribed by artificial or arbitrary rules.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The issuance of some shares for cash and other shares for promissory notes, contracts for past or future services, or for tangible or intangible property or benefits, like the issuance of shares for an inadequate consideration, opens the possibility of
                        dilution of the interests of other shareholders. For example, persons acquiring shares for cash may be unfairly treated if optimistic values are placed on past or future services or intangible benefits being provided by other persons.
                        The problem is particularly acute if the persons providing services, promissory notes, or property or benefits of debatable value are themselves connected with the promoters of the corporation or with its directors. Protection
                        of shareholders against abuse of the power granted to the board of directors to determine that shares should be issued for intangible property or benefits is provided in part by the requirement that the board must act in accordance
                        with the requirements of section 8.30, and, if applicable, section 8.31, in determining that the consideration received for shares is adequate, and in part by the requirement of section 16.21 that the corporation must inform all
                        shareholders annually of all shares issued during the previous year for promissory notes or promises of future services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Accounting principles are not specified in the Model Act, and the board of directors is not required by the statute to determine the "value" of noncash consideration received by the corporation (as was the case in earlier versions of the Model Act). In
                        many instances, property or benefit received by the corporation will be of uncertain value; if the board of directors determines that the issuance of shares for the property or benefit is an appropriate transaction that protects
                        the shareholders from dilution, that is sufficient under section 6.21. The board of directors does not have to make an explicit "adequacy" determination by formal resolution; that determination may be inferred from a determination
                        to authorize the issuance of shares for a specified consideration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.21 also does not require that the board of directors determine the value of the consideration to be entered on the books of the corporation, though the board of directors may do so if it wishes. Of course, a specific value must be placed on
                        the consideration received for the shares for bookkeeping purposes, but bookkeeping details are not the statutory responsibility of the board of directors. The statute also does not require the board of directors to determine the
                        corresponding entry on the right-hand side of the balance sheet under owner's equity to be designated as "stated capital" or be allocated among "stated capital" and other surplus accounts. The corporation, however, may determine
                        that the shareholders' equity accounts should be divided into these traditional categories if it wishes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second sentence of section 6.21(c) describes the effect of the determination by the board of directors that consideration is adequacy for the issuance of shares. That determination, without more, is conclusive to the extent that adequacy is relevant
                        to the question whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid, and nonassessable. Section 6.21(c) provides that shares are fully paid and nonassessable when the corporation receives the consideration for which the board of
                        directors authorized their issuance. Whether shares are validly issued may depend on compliance with corporate procedural requirements, such as issuance within the amount authorized in the articles of incorporation or holding a
                        directors' meeting upon proper notice and with a quorum present. The Model Act does not address the remedies that may be available for issuances that are subject to challenge. This somewhat more elaborate clause replaces the provision
                        in earlier versions of the Model Act and many state statutes that the determination by the board of directors of consideration for the issuance of shares was "conclusive in the absence of fraud in the transaction."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shares issued pursuant to preincorporation subscriptions are governed by section 6.20 and not this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The revised Model Act does not address the question whether validly issued shares may thereafter be cancelled on the grounds of fraud or bad faith if the shares are in the hands of the original shareholder or other persons who were aware of the circumstances
                        under which they were issued when they acquired the shares. It also leaves to the Uniform Commercial Code other questions relating to the rights of persons other than the person acquiring the shares from the corporation. See the
                        Official Commercial to section 6.22.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.21(e) permits the board of directors to determine that shares issued for promissory notes or for contracts for future services or benefits be placed in escrow or their transfer otherwise restricted until the services are performed, the benefits
                        received, or the notes are paid. The section also defines the rights of the corporation with respect to these shares. If the shares are issued without being restricted as provided in this subsection, they are validly issued insofar

                        Section 6.21(a) provides that the powers granted to the board of directors by this section may be reserved to the shareholders by the articles of incorporation. No negative inference should be drawn from section 6.21(a) with respect to the efficacy of
                        similar provisions under other sections of the Model Act.

                        Except for a minor stylistic change, this section is identical to section 6.21 of the Model Act. It differs in three main respects from former G.S. 55-46. First, the provisions of this section do not tie the minimum amount of consideration that must be
                        received upon the issuance of the shares to their par or stated value. Second, the form that such consideration may take has been expanded to include future services and promissory notes, which were prohibited by former G.S. 55-46(b).
                        Third, the board of directors is no longer required to state its determination of the fair value to the corporation of noncash consideration paid for shares; it is required only to determine that the noncash consideration is adequate.

                        Purpose Is to Prevent Fraud. - Former G.S. 55-62 was passed in order that stock subscriptions should be protected in their integrity and not become a means of deceiving those who dealt with the corporation. Goodman v. White,

                        Effect of Charter Provision That Stock Be Issued as Fully Paid. - A provision in the charter of an incorporated company that the capital stock "shall be issued as full-paid stock" does not permit shares of stock to be issued to stockholders without payment
                        in money or its equivalent in property at an honest valuation. Clayton v. Ore Knob Co., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 385</cite>, 14 S.E. 36 (1891).

                        Cash Payment Unnecessary. - It is not essential to a bona fide subscription to stock in a corporation that there be a present payment in cash by the subscriber, or that he be solvent; a subscription is considered bona fide whenever made by one who subscribes
                        in good faith, with reasonable expectation and apparent prospect of being able to pay assessments on his stock as they may thereafter be called for. Boushall v. Myatt, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 328</cite>,

                        Burden of Proof as to Value of Property. - The burden of proving that property was taken in payment at its true value, and, further, that such value was approved by a board of directors acting independently in the interest of the corporation, is upon
                        the person who alleges payment. Goodman v. White, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 399</cite>, 93 S.E. 906 (1917).

                        Proceedings Where Property Fraudulently Overvalued. - Although a margin may be allowed for an honest difference of opinion as to value, a valuation grossly excessive, knowingly made, while its acceptance may bind the corporation, is a fraud on creditors,
                        and they may proceed against the stockholders who sell the property individually, as for an unpaid subscription. Hobgood v. Ehlen, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 344</cite>, 53 S.E. 857 (1906); Goodman v.

                        valuation of the property by the directors, knowingly made, is strong evidence of fraud, and may be conclusive thereof. Whitlock v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 465</cite>, 76 S.E. 538 (1912).

                        Nonsuit Properly Granted Absent Fraud. - The judgment of the board of directors, in fixing the value of property to be accepted in lieu of money, is conclusive in the absence of fraud; and in a suit to recover on a stock subscription, where there is no
                        evidence of fraud, a judgment as of nonsuit is properly granted. Gover v. Malever, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 774</cite>, 122 S.E. 841 (1924).

                        Illegal Transaction by Promoter. - A transaction whereby a promoter borrowed a certain sum and bought a half interest in a company, and let the company that he was promoting take it over as soon as it was incorporated, and pay his note, and also issue
                        to him stock as the consideration, was illegal. Goodman v. White, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 399</cite>, 93 S.E. 906 (1917).

                        The word "rendered" in former statute indicated that the services had to be performed prior to the issuance of the shares; so the requirement that the shares be taken for an agreed price has been satisfied by previous years of work in the business. Penley

                        Cancellation of Officer's Shares for Nonpayment of Consideration. - Where the trial court specifically found as fact that officer and director paid no consideration for stock and caused a dilution of the shares of the other shareholders, the trial court
                        properly cancelled his shares. Stone v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 410, 355 S.E.2d 255, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 638</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 105

                    <p>
                        With the elimination of the concepts of par value and watered stock in 1980, the sole obligation of a purchaser of shares from the corporation, as set forth in section 6.22(a), is to pay the consideration established by the board of directors (or the
                        consideration specified in the subscription, in the case of pre-incorporation subscriptions). The consideration for the shares may consist of promissory notes, contracts for future services, or tangible or intangible property or
                        benefits, and, if the board of directors so decide, the delivery of the notes, contracts, or accrual of the benefits constitutes full payment for the shares. See the Official Comment to section 6.21. Upon the transfer to the corporation
                        of the consideration so determined or specified, the shareholder has no further responsibility to the corporation or its creditors "with respect to the shares," though the shareholder may have continuing obligations under a contract
                        or promissory note entered into in connection with the acquisition of shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.22(a) deals only with the responsibility for payment by the purchaser of shares from the corporation. The revised Model Act leaves to the Uniform Commercial Code questions with respect to the rights of subsequent purchasers of shares and the
                        power of the corporation to cancel shares if the consideration is not paid when due. See sections 8-202 and 8-301 of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.22(b) sets forth the basic rule of nonliability of shareholders for corporate acts or debts that underlies modern corporation law. Unless such liability is provided for in the articles of incorporation, see section 2.02(b)(v), shareholders are
                        not liable for corporate obligations, though the last clause recognizes that such liability may be assumed voluntarily or by other conduct.

                        Unpaid Balances to Be Collected. - As the capital stock, paid or unpaid, of a corporation is a trust fund for the benefit of creditors, it is the duty of the courts, at the suit of creditors, to require unpaid subscriptions to be collected at least to
                        the extent necessary to pay the unpaid debts of the corporation. Wilson Cotton Mills v. Randleman Cotton Mills, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 475</cite>, 20 S.E. 770 (1894).

                    <p>
                        A share dividend is solely a paper transaction: No assets are received by the corporation for the shares and any "dividend" paid in shares does not involve the distribution of property by the corporation to its shareholders. Section 6.23 therefore recognizes
                        that such a transaction involves the issuance of shares "without consideration," and section 1.40(6) excludes it from the definition of a "distribution." Such transactions were treated in a fictional way under the old "par value"
                        and "stated capital" statutes, which treated a share dividend as involving transfers from a surplus account to stated capital and assumed that par value shares could be issued without receiving any consideration by reason of that
                        transfer of surplus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The par value statutory treatment of share dividend transactions distinguished a share "split" from a dividend. In a share "split" the par value of the former shares was divided among the new shares and there was no transfer of surplus into the stated
                        capital account as in the case of a share "dividend." Since the Model Act has eliminated the concept of par value, the distinction between a "split" and a "dividend" has not been retained and both types of transactions are referred
                        to simply as "share dividends." A distinction between "share dividends" and "share splits," however, continues to exist in other contexts - for example, in connection with transactions by publicly held corporations, see N.Y.S.E.

                        A "reversed stock split" is not a share dividend under this section of the Model Act. A reverse split involves an amendment to the articles of incorporation reducing the number of authorized shares, not the issuance of additional shares.

                        Share dividends may create problems when a corporation has more than a single class of shares. The requirement that a share dividend be "pro rata" only applies to shares of the same class or series; if there are two or more classes entitled to receive
                        a share dividend in different proportions, the dividend will have to be allocated appropriately.

                        The distribution of shares of one class to holders of another class may dilute the equity of the holders of the first class. Therefore, subsection (b) permits the distribution of shares of one class to the holders of another class only if one or more
                        of the following conditions are met: (1) the articles of incorporation expressly authorize the transaction, (2) the holders of the class being distributed consent to the distribution, or (3) there are no holders of the class being
                        distributed.

                        A specific provision authorizing the creation of share options and share rights appears in many states statutes. Even though corporations doubtless have the inherent power to issue share options and share rights, specific authorization is desirable because
                        of the economic importance of options and rights, and because of the need to establish the primacy of the board of directors in determining the consideration received by the corporation for rights and options. The creation of incentive
                        compensation plans for directors, officers, agents, and employees is basically a matter of business judgment and the good faith determination by the board of directors should therefore be conclusive. This is as true for incentive
                        plans that involve the issuance of share options or rights as for those that involve the payment of cash. In appropriate cases incentive plans may involve the granting of options at prices below the current market prices of the
                        shares.

                        Section 6.24 does not require shareholder approval of share options or rights as incentive plans. Of course, prior shareholder approval may be required as a discretionary matter, in order to comply with the requirements of national security exchanges

                        The reference to the "form" of a right, option, or warrant in section 6.24 permits the board of directors to designate the interest issued under section 6.24 as options, warrants, rights, or by some other name, and to evidence these interests by certificates,
                        contracts, letter agreements, or in other forms that are appropriate under the circumstances. Rights, options, or warrants may be issued together with or independently of the corporation's issue and sale of its shares or other

                        Subsection (a) is identical to section 6.24 of the Model Act and is intended to be very broad in authorizing the creation and issuance of options, convertible securities and rights to acquire shares and other kinds of securities and property. The Model
                        Act's catchline for the section was changed to reflect this broad scope. Unlike former G.S. 55-45(a), the statute itself does not require shareholder approval of any options granted thereunder; but, as noted in the Official Comment,
                        such approval may be required by other rules or regulations.

                        Subsection (b) contains special provisions that do not appear in either the prior law or the Model Act and are designed to eliminate uncertainty as to the validity of certain rights plans created by companies with a class of securities registered under
                        the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Such plans usually contain features that might otherwise be held to violate the letter or intent of the corporate statute as a whole. Specifically, the rights plans typically used as defenses
                        to hostile takeovers (called "poison pills") create purchase or conversion rights that are not exercisable in the hands of a hostile bidder. Without explicit statutory language to the contrary, for example, such a discriminatory
                        feature might be held to violate the requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a06s55-6-01" target="_self">G.S. 55-6-01</a></cite> that all shares of the same class have the same rights, or the requirement
                        of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a06s55-6-23ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 55-6-23(a)</a></cite> that share dividends be issued pro rata. The drafters were of that view that rights plans should not be generally prohibited. Several
                        states, including New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin and Hawaii, have adopted explicit validating language similar to that included in this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last sentence of subsection (b) was included to make it clear that the broad enabling language of the subsection was not intended to eliminate or limit the directors' duty, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-30ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-30(a)</a></cite>                        and otherwise, to act in good faith, with due care and in the best interests of the corporation. Thus, their action in creating and using a "poison pill" as a defensive device would be subject to judicial review in an appropriate
                        proceeding in which the court may formulate or apply appropriate standards to insure that the directors' actions are in the best long-term interests and short-term interests of the corporation and its shareholders considering,
                        without limitation, the prospects for potential growth, development, productivity and profitability of the corporation.

                    <p>
                        This section sets forth the minimum requirements for share certificates. A corporation whose shares are not publicly traded will normally issue certificates that meet these minimum requirements and little more. Securities that are publicly traded, on
                        the other hand, must contain reasonable safeguards against fraudulent duplication; for this reason, regulations by exchanges contain technical requirements relating to design, workmanship, engraving, and printing. Also, exchange
                        requirements may require signatures of a transfer agent and registrar as well as designated corporate officers. All these requirements are in addition to the minimum requirements of the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certificateless shares are permitted under section 6.25(a) upon compliance with section 6.26. Section 6.25(a) makes it clear that there are no differences in the rights and obligations of shareholders, whether or not their shares are represented by certificates,
                        other than mechanical differences, such as the means by which instructions for transfer are communicated to the issuer, necessitated by the use or nonuse of certificates. If share transfer restrictions are imposed, conspicuous
                        references must appear on the certificate if they are to be binding on third persons without knowledge of the restrictions. See section 6.27.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 6.25 all signatures on a share certificate may be facsimiles. This change, which has been adopted recently in several states, gives recognition to the fact that a purchaser of publicly traded shares will hardly ever be in a position to determine
                        whether a manual signature on a stock certificate is in fact the authorized signature of an officer or the transfer agent or registrar. From the standpoint of the issuing corporation of publicly traded securities, if a share certificate
                        requiring a manual signature is stolen and the signature thereafter forged, the corporation may defend on lack of genuineness under section 8-202(3) of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. But this defense is not effective against a bona
                        fide purchaser when the forged signature has been placed on the certificate by an employee of the issuer or registrar or transfer agent entrusted with handling the certificates (UCC
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 8-205). It is likely that a corporation would therefore follow the same security precautions for blank certificates requiring manual signatures as for those not requiring them. At the same time, the time and expense
                        required for manual signatures has been eliminated.

                    <p>
                        Section 6.26(a) authorizes the creation of uncertificated shares either by original issue or in substitution for shares previously represented by certificates. This subsection gives the board of directors the widest discretion so that a particular class
                        and series of shares might be entirely represented by certificates, entirely uncertificated, or represented partly by each. The second sentence ensures that a corporation may not treat as uncertificated, and accordingly transferable
                        on its books without due presentation of a certificate, any shares for which a certificate is outstanding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statement required by section 6.26(b) ensures that holders of uncertificated shares will receive from the corporation the same information that the holders of certificates receive when certificates are issued. There is no requirement that this information
                        be delivered to purchasers of uncertificated shares before purchase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Detailed rules with respect to the issuance, transfer, and registration of both certificated and uncertificated shares appear in article 8 of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE. In general terms there are no differences between certificated and uncertificated
                        securities except in matters such as their manner of transfer. See the Official Comment to section 6.25.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Share transfer restrictions are widely used by both publicly held and closely held corporations for a variety of appropriate purposes. Although most courts have upheld reasonable share transfer restrictions, a few have rigidly followed the common law
                        rule that they constituted restraints on alienation and should be strictly construed. As a result, some cases have invalidated restrictions outright or construed them narrowly so as not to cover specific transfers. By prescribing
                        reasonable rules to govern the use of transfer restrictions, section 6.27 should guide practitioners in their use and encourage a more uniform and favorable judicial reception.

                        This listing, while not exhaustive, illustrates the flexibility of share transfer restrictions, their widespread use, and the importance of having a statute dealing with them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.27(a) generally authorizes the imposition of transfer restrictions on "shares," although the caption of the section refers to "shares and other securities." Section 6.27(e) defines "shares" for purposes of section 6.27 to include securities
                        "convertible into or carrying a right to subscribe for or acquire shares;" the phrase "other securities" in the title thus describes the broader scope of this section resulting from the definition in section 6.27(e).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Share transfer restrictions are usually created by provisions in the bylaws or articles of incorporation but may also be created by contract between the corporation and some or all the shareholders or between or among the shareholders themselves. However,
                        if shares are originally issued free of restriction, they may not thereafter be subjected to a transfer restriction without the consent of the holder, evidenced by a vote in favor of the amendment to the articles or bylaws creating
                        the restriction, or by being a party to the contract creating the restriction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The terms of a restriction on transfer do not need to be set forth in full or summarized in detail on a certificate or information statement required by section 6.26(b) for uncertificated securities. Rather, section 6.27(b) provides that in the case of
                        a certificated security, the existence of the restriction must be conspicuously set forth on the front or back of the certificate; in the case of an uncertificated security, the existence of the restriction must be noted in the
                        information statement. There is no requirement that the notation on an information statement be conspicuous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a transferee knows of the restriction he is bound by it even though the restriction is not noted on the certificate or information statement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.27(c) describes the purposes for which restrictions may be imposed while section 6.27(d) describes the types of restrictions that may be imposed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.27(c) enumerates certain purposes for which share transfer restrictions may be imposed, but does not limit the purposes since section 6.27(c)(3) permits restrictions "for any other reasonable purpose." Examples of the "status" referred to in
                        section 6.27(c)(1) are the election of close corporation status under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement, the subchapter S election under the Internal Revenue Code, and entitlement to a program or eligibility for
                        a privilege administered by governmental agencies or national securities exchanges. Specific references in section 6.27 to subchapter S and other statutes were not made because of the possibility that the Internal Revenue Code
                        or other statute may be amended or recodified after the adoption of the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.27(c)(2) permits restrictions on transfers of shares to ensure availability of exemptions under state or federal securities acts. Share transfer restrictions for other purposes are permitted by section 6.23(c)(3) so long as the purpose is reasonable.
                        It is unnecessary to inquire into the reasonableness of the purposes specifically enumerated in section 6.27(c)(1) and (2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The types of restrictions referred to in section 6.27(d)(1) (buy-sell agreements) and (2) (option agreements) are imposed as a matter of contractual negotiation and do not prohibit the outright transfer of shares. Rather, they designate to whom shares
                        or other securities must be offered at a price established in the agreement or by a formula or method agreed to in advance. By contrast, the restrictions described in sections 6.27(d)(3) and (4) may permanently limit the market
                        for shares by disqualifying all or some potential purchasers. As a result the restrictions imposed by these two provisions must not be "manifestly unreasonable."

        NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY
       </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) by inserting the language "it is not unconscionable under the circumstances." This modification addressed a concern that the Model Act's section 6.27 may allow the enforcement of unconscionable restrictions.
                        The drafters noted that the Model Act's language in section 6.27 may not allow judicial discretion in a situation where there was initially a reasonable purpose in imposing a restriction but over time the effect of the restriction
                        had become unreasonable because of a change in circumstances. Judicial discretion would allow a court in such a situation to judge the restriction at the time its validity and enforceability are questioned. The amendment does not
                        represent an attempt to change the prior law in North Carolina with respect to unconscionable agreements, but rather to preserve expressly the equitable power of the courts to deny enforcement of agreements that are unconscionable
                        under the circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) was also modified so that a restriction on transfer not noted on the certificate or in the information statement is enforceable only against a person who received actual written notice of the restriction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The introductory language of subsection (d) was modified for clarity. Subdivision (d)(5) was added to clarify that subdivisions (1) through (4) are not exclusive. The use of the word "reasonably" in this subsection was not thought to conflict with the
                        "unconscionable" language in subsection (b), because the two subsections have different purposes.

                        Stock Restriction Upheld. - When considering the enforcement of a stock restriction agreement pursuant to this section, a trial court may decline to specifically enforce the agreement if there has been a change of circumstances since its execution, such
                        that its enforcement would be unconscionable; and found that where defendant, an employee at will, was terminated prior to the full vesting of his stock but for a justifiable business purpose, where the parties had discussed but
                        rejected a "buy-out" formula based on fair market value, and where defendant entered freely into an agreement based on adjusted book value, no change of circumstances existed rendering the arm's length agreement unconscionable

                    <p>
                        The original purpose of this section was to deal with the problems created by the concepts of "par value" and "stated capital;" it permitted the corporation to expend its capital for "the reasonable charges and expenses of " organization without fear
                        of making the shares not fully paid or assessable because the assets were reduced below the aggregate par value of the issued shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the modern capitalization principles set forth in the Model Act (see the Official Comment to section 6.21), there is no basis for the fear that shares issued properly under section 6.21 can be made assessable because of the subsequent use of the
                        proceeds. While section 6.28 thus may be technically unnecessary, it was believed to be desirable to retain in the Model Act a general authorization to the corporation to pay its expenses of formation and raising capital out of
                        its original capitalization. The reference to "reasonable" charges and expenses was deleted on the theory that the test for these expenses should be no different from the test for expenses of any other type.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concluding language in the original Model Act, "without rendering the shares not fully paid or assessable," was also deleted as unnecessary and confusing in the context of the revisions to the financial provisions of the Model Act.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    <p>
                        Section 6.30(a) adopts an "opt in" provision for preemptive rights: Unless an affirmative reference to these rights appears in the articles of incorporation, no preemptive rights exist. Whether or not preemptive rights are elected, however, the directors'
                        fiduciary duties extend to the issuance of shares. Issuance of shares at favorable prices to directors (but excluding other shareholders) or the issuance of shares on a nonproportional basis for the purpose of affecting control
                        rather than raising capital may violate that duty. These duties, it is believed, form a more rational structure of regulation than the technical principles of traditional preemptive rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.30(b) provides a standard model for preemptive rights if the corporation desires to exercise the "opt in" alternative of section 6.30(a). The simple phrase, "the corporation elects to have preemptive rights," or words of similar import, results
                        in the rest of subsection (b) becoming applicable to the corporation. But a corporation may qualify or limit any of the rules set forth in subsection (b) by express provisions in the articles of incorporation if the rules are felt
                        to be undesirable or inappropriate for the specific corporation. The purposes of this standard model for preemptive rights are (1) to simplify drafting articles of incorporation and (2) to provide a simple checklist of business
                        considerations for the benefit of attorneys who are considering the inclusion of preemptive rights in articles of incorporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of sections 6.30(b) establish rules for most of the problems involving preemptive rights. Thus subsection (b)(1) defines the general scope of the preemptive right giving appropriate recognition to the discretion of the board of directors
                        in establishing the terms and conditions for exercise of that right. Subsection (b)(2) creates rules with respect to the waiver of these rights. Subsection (b)(3) lists the principal exceptions to preemptive rights, including a
                        six-month period during which initial capital can be raised by a newly formed corporation without regard to the preemptive rights of persons who have previously acquired shares. Subsections (b)(4) and (b)(5) provide rules for the
                        often-difficult problems created when preemptive rights are recognized in corporations with more than a single class of shares. These problems are discussed further below. Subsection (b)(6) defines the status of preemptive rights
                        after a shareholder has elected not to exercise a proffered preemptive right: for a period of one year thereafter the corporation may dispose of the shares at the same or a higher price. A corporation deciding to offer shares at
                        a lower price must reoffer the shares preemptively to the shareholders before selling them to third persons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As indicated above, any portion of section 6.30(b) that is felt not to be appropriate for a specific corporation may be amended or deleted by appropriate provision in the articles of incorporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The model provision dealing with preemptive rights in section 6.30(b) is primarily designed to protect voting power within the corporation from dilution. For this reason, section 6.30(c) contains a special definition of "shares" to ensure that the preemptive
                        rights of shareholders, if these rights are granted, apply to all securities that are convertible into or carry a right to acquire voting shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the other hand, preemptive rights also may serve in part the function of protecting the equity participation of shareholders. This combination of functions creates no problem in a corporation that has authorized only a single class of shares but may
                        occasionally create problems in corporations with more complex capital structures. In many multiple-class corporate financial structures, the issuance of additional shares of one class does not adversely affect other classes. For
                        example, the issuance of additional general voting shares without preferential rights normally does not affect either the limited voting power or equity participation of holders of shares with preferential rights; holders of shares
                        with preferential equity participation rights but without general voting rights should therefore have no preemptive rights with respect to general voting shares without preferential rights. See subsections (b)(4) and (b)(5). Classes
                        of shares that may give rise to possible conflict between the protection of voting interests and equity participation when the board of directors desires to issue additional shares include classes of nonvoting shares without preferential
                        rights and classes of shares with both preferential rights to distributions and general voting rights. Attorneys who draft articles of incorporation with classes of shares that may give rise to these conflicts should consider the
                        precise application of section 6.30(b) with respect to preemptive rights for these classes and define more carefully the scope of the preemptive rights desired.

                        For corporations incorporated on or after July 1, 1990, this section adopts an "opt in" election for preemptive rights. In contrast to the prior law, unless an affirmative reference to these rights appears in the articles of incorporation, no preemptive
                        rights exist. Former G.S. 55-56 provided for preemptive rights unless limited or denied by the articles of incorporation. Subsection (d) grants preemptive rights under this section to shareholders of corporations incorporated before
                        July 1, 1990, except to the extent the articles of incorporation expressly provide otherwise.

                        to shares of another class.

                    <p>
                        The elimination of the concepts of "par value" and "stated capital" in the 1980 amendments to the Model Act (see the Official Comment to section 6.21) permitted the simplification of a number of other sections of the Act and the elimination of several
                        historical concepts that primarily served the purpose of ameliorating problems created by retention of the concepts of "par value" and "stated capital."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One concept eliminated by the 1980 amendments was that of treasury shares. The status of once-issued but reacquired shares was an uneasy one under the traditional statutes. It was universally recognized that a corporation's shares in its own hands are
                        not an asset any more than authorized but unissued shares. As an economic matter payments made by a corporation to repurchase its own shares must be viewed as a distribution of corporate assets by the corporation rather than as
                        an acquisition of an asset. Further, conventional statutes gave treasury shares an intermediate status between issued and unissued: they were treated as outstanding shares for some purposes, and they could be resold or disposed
                        of by the corporation (presumably) without regard to restrictions that might be imposed on the original issuance of shares by the corporation. Finally, the accounting treatment for treasury shares was complex, confusing, and to
                        some extent unrealistic since the capital accounts often did not reflect transactions in treasury shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the 1980 revisions of the financial provisions in the Model Act the concept of treasury shares is unnecessary. Authorized but unissued shares of the corporation may be issued on the same basis and with the same freedom as treasury shares under earlier
                        statutes. Attorneys' opinions on the legality of the issuance of shares under the revised Model Act will therefore be unaffected by the elimination of the technical distinction between original shares and treasury shares. A possible
                        exception to these statements is that the concept of treasury shares may have permitted listed companies to save modestly on stock exchange listing fees in some cases that may not be available under the revised Model Act provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.31(a) restates the fundamental power of a corporation to reacquire its own shares. Such a transaction constitutes a "distribution" by the corporation (see the definition of that term in section 1.40) and is subject to the limitations of section
                        6.40.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shares that are reacquired by the corporation become authorized but unissued shares under section 6.31(b) unless the articles prohibit reissue, in which event they are cancelled. Section 6.31(c) requires a simplified official filing to reflect the reduction
                        of authorized shares. This provision is included in order that there be a public record of the number of authorized shares that a corporation may issue. The amendment may be made without shareholder action. See section 10.02.

                        Until the amendment referred to in section 6.31(c) is effective, the corporation has power to reissue the reacquired shares despite a prohibition in the articles of incorporation. In such a case, the action of the directors in issuing the shares may be
                        challengeable but the shares so issued would be fully paid and nonassessable if issued in conformity with section 6.21.

        Purpose of 1985 Amendment to Former G.S. 55-52.
       </b> - The 1985 amendment to former G.S. 55-52 was established to enable corporations to enter into written agreements with shareholders at the outset of the relationship for the issuance of stock redeemable at the shareholder's
                        option. The statute was not designed to simply allow the corporation to enter into a written agreement with a shareholder to redeem stock out of and as an impairment to stated capital, which stock was already being held by the
                        shareholder as common stock; rather, the purpose was to provide a new method for North Carolina corporations to raise needed capital by readily available cash infusions from shareholders in exchange for stock redeemable at their
                        request. In re N.W. Oxygen, Inc., 99 Bankr. 703 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1989).

        Agreement Entered into Prior to Amendment.
       </b> - Where former shareholder had a note in exchange for the redemption of his shares in corporation, the note was unenforceable under former G.S. 55-52, as subdivision (c)(3), rather than subdivision (b)(4) thereof, applied.
                        First, subdivision (b)(4) was an amendment to the original provision and was effective in 1985, while the agreement between former shareholder and debtor corporation was executed before the amendment was in effect; second, subdivision
                        (b)(4) was established to enable corporations to enter agreements with shareholders for the issuance of stocks. In the instant case former shareholder and debtor entered into a written agreement some ten years after the issuance
                        of the shares for the sale of the common stock which former shareholder owned. In re N.W. Oxygen, Inc., 99 Bankr. 703 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1989).

        Solvency Test for Each Payment Under Former G.S. 55-52(c).
       </b> - Since former G.S. 55-52 specifically included the words "and pay for" in subsection (c), a solvency test for surplus had to occur each time a corporation made a payment on the indebtedness out of the assets of the
                        corporation. In re N.W. Oxygen, Inc., 99 Bankr. 703 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1989).

        Redemption Agreement Held Unenforceable.

                        to make payment on the obligation out of sufficient surplus of corporate assets. In re N.W. Oxygen, Inc., 99 Bankr. 703 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 1989).

                        The reformulation of the statutory standards governing distributions is another important change made by the 1980 revisions to the financial provisions of the Model Act. It has long been recognized that the traditional "par value" and "stated capital"
                        statutes do not provide significant protection against distributions of capital to shareholders. While most of these statutes contained elaborate provisions establishing "stated capital," "capital surplus," and "earned surplus"
                        (and often other types of surplus as well), the net effect of most statutes was to permit the distribution to shareholders of most or all of the corporation's net assets - its capital along with its earnings - if the shareholders
                        wished this to be done. However, statutes also generally imposed an equity insolvency test on distributions that prohibited distributions of assets if the corporation was insolvent or if the distribution had the effect of making
                        the corporation insolvent or unable to meet its obligations as they were projected to arise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The financial provisions of the revised Model Act, which are based on the 1980 amendments, sweep away all the distinctions among the various types of surplus but retain restrictions on distributions built around both the traditional equity insolvency
                        and balance sheet tests of earlier statutes.

                        Section 1.40 defines "distribution" to include virtually all transfers of money, indebtedness of the corporation or other property to a shareholder in respect of the corporation's shares. It thus includes cash or property dividends, payments by a corporation
                        to purchase its own shares, distributions of promissory notes or indebtedness, and distributions in partial or complete liquidation or voluntary or involuntary dissolution. Section 1.40 excludes from the definition of "distribution"
                        transactions by the corporation in which only its own shares are distributed to its shareholders. These transactions are called "share dividends" in the revised Model Business Corporation Act. See section 6.23.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.40 imposes a single, uniform test on all distributions. Many of the old "par value" and "stated capital" statutes provided tests that varied with the type of distribution under consideration or did not cover certain types of distributions at
                        all.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As noted above, older statutes prohibited payment of dividends if the corporation was, or as a result of the payment would be, insolvent in the equity sense. This test is retained, appearing in section 6.40(c)(1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For an on-going business enterprise the equity insolvency test requires that decisions be based on a cash flow analysis that is itself based on a business forecast and budget for a sufficient period of time to permit a conclusion that known obligations
                        of the corporation can reasonably be expected to be satisfied over the period of time that they will mature. It is not sufficient simply to measure current assets against current liabilities, or determine that the present estimated
                        "liquidation" value of the corporation's assets would produce sufficient funds to satisfy the corporation's existing liabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In determining whether a corporation is, or as a result of a proposed distribution would be rendered, insolvent, the board of directors may rely on information supplied by the officers of the corporation. It is not necessary for them to know of the details
                        of the cash flow analysis if the proposed distribution involves no significant risk of equity insolvency. Judgments, further, must of necessity be made on the basis of information in the hands of the board of directors when a distribution
                        is authorized. See section 8.30.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The revised Model Business Corporation Act establishes the validity of distributions from the corporate law standpoint under section 6.40 and determines the potential liability of directors for improper distributions under sections 8.30 and 8.33. The
                        federal Bankruptcy Act and state fraudulent conveyance statutes, on the other hand, are designed to enable the trustee or other representative to recapture for the benefit of creditors funds distributed to others in some circumstances.
                        In light of these diverse purposes, it was not thought necessary to make the tests of section 6.40 identical with the tests for insolvency under these various statutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.40(c)(2) requires that, after giving effect to any distribution, the corporation's assets equal or exceed its liabilities plus (with some exceptions) the dissolution preferences of senior equity securities. Section 6.40(d) authorizes asset and
                        liability determinations to be made for this purpose on the basis of either (1) financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or (2) a fair valuation
                        or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. The determination of a corporation's assets and liabilities and the choice of the permissible basis on which to do so are left to the judgment of its board of directors.
                        In making a judgment under section 6.40(d), the board may rely under section 8.30 upon opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data prepared or presented by public accountants or others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.40 does not incorporate technical accounting terminology and specific accounting concepts. Accounting terminology and concepts are constantly under review and subject to revision by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the American Institute
                        of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and others. In making determinations under this section, the board of directors may make judgments about accounting matters, taking into account its right
                        to rely upon professional or expert opinion and its obligation to be reasonably informed as to pertinent standards of importance that bear upon the subject at issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a corporation with subsidiaries, the board of directors may rely on unconsolidated statements prepared on the basis of the equity method of accounting (see American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, APB Opinion No. 18 (1971)) as to the corporation's
                        investee corporations, including corporate joint ventures and subsidiaries, although other evidence would be relevant in the total determination.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The directors will normally be entitled to use generally accepted accounting principles and to give presumptive weight to the advice of professional accountants with respect to their application. But section 6.40 only requires the use of accounting practices
                        and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances, and does not constitute a statutory enactment of generally accepted accounting principles. The widespread controversy concerning various accounting principles, and their
                        continuous reevaluation, suggest that a statutory standard of reasonableness, rather than of generally accepted accounting principles, is appropriate. The Model Act does not reject generally accepted accounting principles; on the
                        contrary, it is expected that their use will be the basic rule in most cases. The statutory language does, however, require informed business judgment applying particular accounting principles to the entire circumstances that exist
                        at the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a corporation's financial statements are not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, a board of directors should normally consider the extent to which the assets may not be fairly stated or the liabilities may be understated
                        in determining the aggregate amount of assets and liabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.40(d) specifically permits determinations to be made under section 6.40(c)(2) on the basis of a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. Thus the statute authorizes departures from historical cost accounting and
                        sanctions the use of appraisal methods to determine the funds available for distributions. No particular method of valuation is prescribed in the statute, since different methods may have validity depending upon the circumstances,
                        including the type of enterprise and the purpose for which the determination is made. For example, it is inappropriate to apply a "quick-sale liquidation" value to an enterprise in most cases, particularly with respect to the payment
                        of normal dividends. On the other hand, a "quick-sale valuation" might be appropriate in certain circumstances for an enterprise in the course of liquidation or of reducing its asset or business base by a material degree. In most
                        cases, a fair valuation method or a going-concern basis would be appropriate if it is believed that the enterprise will continue as a going concern.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In determining the value of assets, all of the assets of a corporation, whether or not reflected in the financial statements (e.g., a valuable executory contract), should be considered. Ordinarily a corporation should not selectively revalue assets. Likewise,
                        all of a corporation's obligations and commitments should be considered and quantified to the extent appropriate and possible. In any event, section 6.40(d) imposes upon the board of directors the responsibility of applying under
                        section 6.40(c)(2) a method of determining the aggregate amounts of assets and liabilities that is reasonable in the circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.40(d) also refers to some "other method that is reasonable in the circumstances." This phrase is inserted to comprehend within section 6.40(c)(2) the wide variety of possibilities that might not be considered to fall under a "fair valuation"
                        but might be reasonable in the circumstances of a particular case.

                    <p>
                        Section 6.40(c)(2) provides that a distribution may not be made unless the total assets of the corporation exceed its liabilities plus the amount that would be needed to satisfy any shareholders' superior preferential rights upon dissolution if the corporation
                        were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution. This requirement in effect treats preferential dissolution rights of classes or series of shares for distribution purposes as equivalent to liabilities rather than as equity
                        interests, and carries forward analogous treatment of shares having preferential dissolution rights from earlier versions of the Model Act. In making the calculation of the amount that must be added to the liabilities of the corporation
                        to reflect the preferential dissolution rights, the assumption should be made that the preferential dissolution rights are to be established pursuant to the articles of incorporation (or resolution creating a series having preferential
                        dissolution rights) as of the date of the distribution or proposed distribution. The amount so determined must include arrearages in preferential dividends if the articles of incorporation or resolution require that they be paid
                        upon the dissolution of the corporation. In the case of shares having both a preferential right upon dissolution and additional nonpreferential rights, only the preferential portion of the rights should be taken into account. The
                        treatment of preferential dissolution rights of classes of shares set forth in section 6.40(c)(2) is applicable only to the balance sheet test and is not applicable to the equity insolvency test of section 6.40(c)(1). The treatment
                        of preferential rights mandated by this section may always be eliminated by an appropriate provision in the articles of incorporation.

                    <p>
                        Section 6.40(e)(3) provides that the time for measuring the effect of a distribution for compliance with the insolvency and balance sheet tests for all distributions not involving the reacquisition of shares of the distribution of indebtedness is the
                        date of authorization, if the payment occurs within 120 days following the authorization; if the payment occurs more than 120 days after the authorization, however, the date of payment must be used. If the corporation elects to
                        make a distribution in the form of its own indebtedness under section 6.40(e)(2), the validity of that distribution must be measured as of the time of distribution.

                    <p>

                        date is necessary for a repurchase or reacquisition of shares from one or more specific shareholders. The board of directors has discretion to set a record date for a repurchase or reacquisition if it is to be pro rata and to be

                    <p>
                        In an acquisition of its shares, a corporation may transfer property or incur debt to the former holder of the shares. The case law on the status of this debt is conflicting. However, share repurchase agreements involving payment for shares over a period
                        of time are of special importance in closely held corporate enterprises. Section 6.40(e) provides a clear rule for this situation: the legality of the distribution must be measured at the time of the issuance or incurrence of the
                        debt, not at a later date when the debt is actually paid. Of course, this does not preclude a later challenge of a payment on account of redemption-related debt by a bankruptcy trustee on the ground that it constitutes a preferential
                        payment to a creditor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 6.40(f) provides that indebtedness created to purchase shares or issued as a distribution is on a parity with the indebtedness of the corporation to its general, unsecured creditors, except to the extent subordinated by agreement. General creditors
                        are better off in these situations than they would have been if cash or other property had been paid out for the shares or distributed (which is proper under the statute), and no worse off than if cash had been paid out to the
                        shareholders, which was then lent back to the corporation, making the shareholders creditors. The parity created by section 6.40(f) therefore is logically consistent with the rule established by section 6.40(e) that these transactions

                    <p>
                        This section introduces significant changes from prior law in the criteria used to determine a corporation's legal capacity to pay dividends and reacquire its shares. The former surplus tests no longer apply. In addition, the provisions of former G.S.
                        55-52, which limited the circumstances under which a corporation could reacquire its shares, were not brought forward. All distributions to shareholders, whether by dividends or repurchases of shares, are determined by that distribution's
                        impact on the corporation's solvency and the relationship between its assets and liabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (d) to make it clear that for purposes of determining asset values under the equity insolvency and balance sheet tests of subsection (c), the board of directors may use either book values or a current valuation
                        if it is reasonable under the circumstances. For purposes of determining liabilities and assets that are not revalued, the board of directors may rely on financial statements prepared in accordance with reasonable accounting practices
                        and principles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (f) to clarify that a corporation may agree to secure its indebtedness to a shareholder by granting a deed of trust or other security interest. The shareholder may also agree to subordinate the indebtedness, in
                        whole or in part, to the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors. Absent an agreement either to secure or to subordinate a corporation's indebtedness to a shareholder, such indebtedness will be at parity
                        with the corporation's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (g) was added to the Model Act's provisions to address the question of how to treat a liability that by its own terms cannot be paid if its payment would violate this section. This change required the cross-reference added to subsection (e).

                        "Nimble dividends" (dividends paid out of current earnings) were expressly authorized under former G.S. 55-50(a)(2). That provision was not brought forward.

                    <p>
                        Subsections (h), (i), and (j) bring forward the provisions of former G.S. 55-50(k) through (m).

                        Joinder of Suit for Failure to Declare Dividends with Cause of Action for Liquidation. - A stockholder in a corporation may sue the corporation, and join its directors as defendants, for failure to declare adequate dividends from the corporation's earnings;
                        and may join therewith a second cause of action for liquidation and involuntary dissolution of the corporation based upon bad faith management in suppressing dividends and in deflating the value of the corporation's assets, thus
                        precluding the plaintiff stockholder from obtaining either a fair dividend or a fair market value for his stock. Dowd v. Charlotte Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 101</cite>, 139 S.E.2d

                        of company, received substantial compensation from the sale of the corporation's assets without informing plaintiff of the sale or making provision for contractual debt to plaintiff. Hudson v. Jim Simmons Pontiac-Buick, Inc.,

                        Creditors Lacked Standing. - Plaintiffs lacked standing to assert claims (1) that the joinder agreements executed by two defendants were fraudulent transfers in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.039.html#t39a3As39-23.1" target="_blank">G.S. 39-23.1</a></cite>                        and unlawful distributions in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-33" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-33</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a06s55-6-40" target="_self">G.S. 55-6-40</a></cite>, for which all
                        defendants were liable, or alternatively, (2) for unauthorized execution, because such claims could have been brought by any of the corporation's creditors who, like plaintiffs, were denied timely payment of the corporation's debts
                        when execution of the joinder agreements led to its insolvency. Angell v. Kelly, 336 F. Supp. 2d 540 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

                        Bankruptcy Trustee Had Standing. - There is no case law in North Carolina delineating who has standing to sue a shareholder under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a06s55-6-40" target="_self">G.S. 55-6-40</a></cite>; however, dividends
                        are transfers of corporate property. Since the statute declares such distributions to be "invalid," it would appear that the bankruptcy trustee would have standing to sue, under two alternate grounds: (1) as an effort to recover
                        property under 11 U.S.C.S.
                        <span class="s1">

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.01(a) requires every corporation to hold an annual meeting each year of shareholders entitled to participate in the election of directors and to consider other matters coming before the meeting of shareholders. In most instances, the meeting
                        will involve only the holders of a single class of voting shares. The principal action to be taken at the annual meeting is the election of directors pursuant to section 8.03, but the purposes of an annual meeting are not limited
                        and all matters appropriate for shareholder action may also be considered at that meeting. An annual meeting is also the appropriate forum for a shareholder to raise any relevant question about the corporation's operations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement of section 7.01(a) that an annual meeting be held is phrased in mandatory terms to ensure that every shareholder entitled to participate in the meeting has the unqualified rights (1) to demand that the annual meeting be held and (2) to
                        compel the holding of the meeting under section 7.03 if the corporation does not promptly hold the meeting. Many corporations, such as non-public subsidiaries and closely held corporations, do not regularly hold annual meetings,
                        and if no shareholder objects, that practice creates no problem under section 7.01, since section 7.01(c) provides that failure to hold an annual meeting does not affect the validity of any corporate action. Rather than holding
                        an annual meeting, the shareholders may elect directors and take other appropriate action by unanimous written consent under section 7.04. And, even if the shareholders fail to elect directors, the directors currently in office
                        continue in office under section 8.05 beyond the expiration of their terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The time and place of the annual meeting may be "stated in or fixed in accordance with the bylaws." If the bylaws do not themselves fix a time and place for the annual meeting, authority to fix them may be delegated to the board of directors or to a specified
                        corporate officer. This section thus gives corporations the flexibility to hold annual meetings in varying places at varying times as convenience may dictate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The annual meeting may be held either inside or outside the state or in a foreign country, but if the bylaws do not fix, or state the method of fixing, the place of the meeting, the meeting must be held at the "principal office" of the corporation. The
                        principal office is defined in section 1.40 as the location of the principal executive office of the corporation and may or may not be its registered or official office under section 5.01. Section 16.22 requires that the address
                        of the principal office be specified in the corporation's annual report.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the annual meeting is not held either within 6 months of the close of the corporation's fiscal year or within 15 months of the last annual meeting, a shareholder may compel an annual meeting to be held under section 7.03. In the absence of a demand
                        for a meeting, a corporation can operate indefinitely without actually holding an annual meeting. The shareholders may act by unanimous consent under section 7.04, and in any event directors, once duly elected, remain in office
                        until their successors are qualified. See section 8.05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Authority granted to the board of directors or some individual to fix the time and place of the annual meeting must be exercised in good faith. See

                        The second sentence of subsection (c) was added to the Model Act's provisions to bring forward the provisions of former G.S. 55-61(b) regarding the holding of a substitute annual meeting. Subsection (d), which brings forward former G.S. 55-61(d), was
                        added to make it clear that any matter appropriate for shareholder action is a proper subject for action at an annual meeting of shareholders.

                            Any meeting other than an annual meeting is a special meeting under section 7.02. The principal formal differences between an annual and a special meeting are that at an annual meeting directors are elected and, subject to the special notice requirements
                            of section 7.05(b), any relevant issue pertaining to the corporation may be considered, while a special meeting must be called for specific purposes and may only consider matters within those purposes.

                        A special meeting may be called under section 7.02(a) by the board of directors or the person or persons authorized to do so by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Typically, the person or persons holding certain designated offices within the corporation,
                        e.g., the president, chairman of the board of directors, or chief executive officer, are given authority to call special meetings of the shareholders. In addition, the holders of at least 10 percent of the votes entitled to be
                        cast on a proposed issue at the special meeting may require the corporation to hold a special meeting by signing, dating, and delivering one or more writings that demand a special meeting and set forth the purpose or purposes of
                        the desired meeting. Shareholders demanding a special meeting do not have to sign a single piece of paper, but the writings signed must all describe essentially the same purpose or purposes. Upon receipt of writings evidencing
                        a demand by holders of 10 percent of the votes, the corporation (through an appropriate officer) must call the special meeting at a reasonable time and place. The shareholders' demand may suggest a time and place but the final
                        decision on such matters is the corporation's. If no meeting is held within the time periods specified in section 7.03, the shareholders may obtain a summary court order under that section requiring that the meeting be held.

                    <p>
                        Section 7.02(b) fixes a record date for determining the shareholders entitled to sign a demand for a special shareholders' meeting. Unless a record date is otherwise fixed for this purpose, the record date is the date the first shareholder signs the demand.
                        If a shareholder initially signs a demand but later seeks to withdraw his demand, the corporation may permit the shareholder to do so.

                    <p>
                        Under section 7.02(a)(2) it is possible that more than one faction of shareholders may demand meetings at roughly the same time or that a single (or changing) faction of shareholders may request consecutive, overlapping, or repetitive meetings. The responsible
                        corporate officers have some discretion as to the call and purposes of a meeting, and where demands are repetitious or overlapping, they may refuse to call a meeting for a purpose identical or similar to a purpose for which a previous
                        special meeting was held in the recent past. Similarly, they may decline to call a special meeting when an annual meeting will be held in the near future. This limited discretion of the corporation to deny repetitive or overlapping
                        demands may ultimately be tested under section 7.03, which itself gives the court discretion whether or not to compel the holding of a special meeting under these circumstances. See the Official Comment to section 7.03.

                        Section 7.05(c) provides that a notice of a special meeting must include a "description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called." Section 7.02(d) states that only business that is within that purpose or those purposes may be conducted
                        at the special meeting. The word "within" was chosen, rather than a broader phrase like "reasonably related to," to describe the relationship between the notice and the authorized business to assure a shareholder who does not attend
                        a special meeting that new or unexpected matters will not be considered in his absence.

                        Section 7.03 provides the remedy for shareholders if the corporation refuses or fails to hold a shareholders' meeting as required by section 7.01 or 7.02. A shareholder entitled to participate in a meeting may apply for a summary court order to command
                        the holding of a meeting if (1) an annual meeting is not held within 6 months after the end of the corporation's fiscal year or 15 months after its last annual meeting, or (2) a special meeting is not properly noticed within 30
                        days after a valid demand is delivered to the secretary of the corporation or, if properly noticed, is not held in accordance with the notice. Since a meeting must be held within 60 days of the notice date under section 7.05, the
                        maximum delay between the demand for a special meeting and the right to petition a court for a summary order is 90 days.

                        The identity of the specific court with jurisdiction to order a shareholder's meeting under section 7.03(a) must be supplied by each state when enacting this section. It is intended that this should be a court of general civil jurisdiction. Generally,
                        all matters relating to a corporation should be addressed to the court in the county where the corporation's principal office is located in the state or, if the corporation does not have a principal office in the state, to the
                        court in the county in which its registered office is located.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court has discretion under section 7.03 since the language of the statute is that the court "may summarily order" that a meeting be held. A court, for example, may refuse to order a special meeting if the specified purpose is repetitive of the purpose
                        of a special meeting held in the recent past. See the Official Comment to section 7.02. Alternatively, the court may view the demand as a good faith request for reconsideration of an action taken in the recent past and may order
                        a meeting to be held. Similarly, even though a demand for an annual meeting is not a formal prerequisite for an application for a summary order under this section, the court may withhold setting a time and date for the annual meeting
                        for a reasonably short period in order to permit the corporation to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In any event, a shareholder applying for a summary order to hold a meeting has the burden of showing that he is entitled to the order. In the case of a special meeting, he has the burden of showing that the demand was executed by the holders of at least
                        10 percent of the votes entitled to be cast on the record date and that the demand was duly delivered to the corporation's secretary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the court orders that a meeting be held, it may fix the time and place of the meeting, determine the voting groups entitled to participate in the meeting, set the record date, order notice to be given as required by section 7.05, and enter such other
                        orders as may be appropriate for the holding of the meeting. The court may also establish the quorum requirements for specific matters to be considered at the meeting or direct that the votes represented at the meeting automatically
                        constitute a quorum for the taking of any action without regard to section 7.25 or any provision to the contrary in the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws. The latter alternative prevents a holder of the majority
                        of the votes (who may not desire that a meeting be held) from frustrating the court-ordered meeting by not attending to prevent the existence of a quorum. In order to prevent misunderstanding about a special quorum requirement,
                        if one is imposed, it is appropriate for the court to order that the notice of the meeting state specifically and conspicuously that a special quorum requirement is applicable to the court-ordered meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The court may provide that a meeting it has ordered is to be the annual meeting. If so provided, the meeting should be viewed as compliance with section 7.01, precluding all other shareholder requests for an annual meeting for that year.

                        The language of the Model Act in the introductory clause of subsection (a) was modified to clarify that notice must be given to a corporation before a shareholders' meeting can be summarily ordered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subdivision (a)(1) to allow any shareholder, not just those entitled to participate in the meeting, to apply for a court-ordered annual meeting of shareholders if the meeting is not held within 15 months after the corporation's
                        last annual meeting. The change reflects the principle that all shareholders have an interest in the corporation's holding shareholders' meetings. In addition, the Model Act permits a shareholder to petition for a court-ordered
                        meeting if no annual meeting is held within the earlier of six months after the close of the corporation's fiscal year or 15 months after the last annual meeting. The drafters concluded that the six months' limitation was undesirably
                        restrictive and effectively mandated meetings during a particular part of the year. This provision was therefore omitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subdivision (a)(2) to clarify that a demand must actually be received by the corporation's secretary.

                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to allow reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, to be awarded to an applying shareholder in the discretion of the court.

                    <p>
                        Section 7.04 provides that all the shareholders entitled to vote on an issue may validly act by unanimous written consent without a meeting. Unanimous written consent is obtainable, as a practical matter, only on matters on which there are only a relatively
                        few shareholders entitled to vote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.04 is based on the fundamental premise that if all the voting shareholders desire some action to be taken, no purpose is served by requiring the formality of holding a meeting of shareholders. Action by unanimous written consent has the same
                        effect as a meeting vote and may be described as such in any document, including documents delivered to the secretary of state for filing. Section 7.04 is applicable to any shareholder action, including, without limitation, election
                        of directors, approval of mergers or sales of substantially all the corporate property not in the ordinary course of business, amendments of articles of incorporation, and dissolution.

                    <p>
                        To be effective, consents must be in writing, signed by all the shareholders entitled to vote, and delivered to the secretary of the corporation. The phrase "one or more written consents" is included in section 7.04(a) to make it clear that all shareholders
                        do not need to sign the same piece of paper. The record date for determining who is entitled to vote, if not otherwise fixed by or in accordance with the bylaws, is the date the first shareholder signs the consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Action by unanimous written consent is effective only when the last shareholder has signed the appropriate written consent and all consents have been delivered to the secretary of the corporation. Before that time, any shareholder may withdraw his consent
                        simply by advising the secretary of that fact. Cf.
                        <i>
        Calumet Industries, Inc. v. McClure,
       </i> 464 F. Supp. 19 (N.D. Ill. 1978). The withdrawal of a single consent, of course, destroys the unanimous written consent required by this section. If a shareholder seeks to withdraw his consent after all shareholders
                        have signed written consents and filed them with the secretary of the corporation, the corporation may treat the attempted withdrawal as too late or give it effect, thereby requiring the matter to be presented at a shareholders'
                        meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.04 is applicable to all shareholder actions, including the approval of fundamental corporate changes described in chapters 10, 11, 12, and 14. If these actions were taken at an annual or special meeting, shareholders who were not entitled to
                        vote on the matter would nevertheless be entitled to receive notice of the meeting, including a description of the transaction proposed to be considered at the meeting. See, e.g., sections 10.03 (notice of proposed amendment),
                        11.03 (notice of proposed merger). In order to ensure that nonvoting shareholders have essentially the same right if action is taken by consent rather than at a meeting, section 7.04(d) provides that all nonvoting shareholders
                        must be given at least 10 days' written notice of the fundamental corporate changes that are proposed for approval by consent.

                        Effective January 1, 2002, this section was amended to permit less than unanimous shareholder action without meeting for corporations other than public corporations. Subsection (b) was amended to add a requirement that written consents to an action must
                        be obtained from shareholders within a period of 60 days. Subsection (d) was amended to require advance notice of proposed shareholder action on certain fundamental corporate changes to all shareholders (other than shareholders
                        who consent to the action) rather than only to holders of nonvoting shares. Advance notice is not required if the articles of incorporation so provided. Subsection (e) was added to provide that if action is taken by less than unanimous
                        written consent, notice of the action must be given within 10 days after the action is taken to all shareholders who have not consented to the action and who would have been entitled to notice of the proposed action if the action
                        had been taken at a meeting.

                        Comment indicates that this was the case even before this amendment. However, the Official Comment also indicates that a corporation may elect to give effect to a revocation received after the corporation has received consents
                        sufficient to take the action. In keeping with changes in the Model Business Corporation Act made since the Official Comment was written, this section as amended provides that the revocation must be received by the corporation

                        Generally, only shareholders who are entitled to vote at a meeting are entitled to notice. Thus, notice usually needs to be sent only to holders of shares entitled to vote for an election of directors or generally on other matters (in the case of an annual
                        meeting), and on matters within the specified purposes set forth in the notice (in the case of a special meeting), and only to holders of shares of those classes or series of shares on the record date. The last sentence of section
                        7.05(a), however, recognizes that other sections of the Act require that notice of meetings at which certain types of fundamental corporate changes are to be considered must be sent to all shareholders, including holders of shares
                        who are not entitled to vote on any matter at the meeting. See sections 10.03, 11.03, 12.02, and 14.02. In addition, the articles of incorporation may require that notice of meetings be given to all or specified voting groups of
                        shareholders who are not entitled to vote on the matters considered at those meetings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notice of all special meetings must include a description of the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called and the matters acted upon at the meeting are limited to those within the notice of meeting. By contrast, the notice of an annual meeting
                        usually need not refer to any specific purpose or purposes, and any matter appropriate for shareholder action may be considered. As recognized in subsection (b), however, other provisions of the revised Model Act provide that certain
                        types of fundamental corporate changes may be considered at an annual meeting only if specific reference to the proposed action appears in the notice of meeting. See sections 10.03, 11.03, 12.02, and 14.02. In addition, if the
                        board of directors chooses, a notice of an annual meeting may contain references to purposes or proposals not required by statute. In either event, if a notice of an annual meeting refers specifically to one or more purposes, the
                        meeting is not limited to those purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.05(d) is a catch-all record date provision for both annual and special meetings. If the record date for notice and for voting entitlement is not otherwise fixed pursuant to sections 7.03 or 7.07, the record date for purposes of determining who
                        is entitled to notice and to vote at the meeting is the close of business on the day before the notice is mailed to the voting groups of shareholders. If notice is mailed to shareholders over a period of more than one day, the
                        day before the notice is delivered to the first shareholders is the record date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The selection of the close of business on the day before the notice is mailed as the catch-all record date is intended to permit the corporation to mail notices to shareholders on a given day without regard to any requests for transfer that may have been
                        received during that day. For this reason, this section is not inconsistent with the general principle set forth in the last sentence of section 7.07(a) that the board of directors may not fix a retroactive record date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.05(e) provides rules for adjourned meetings and determines whether new notice must be given to shareholders. Under this subsection a meeting may be adjourned to a different date, time, or place without additional notice to the shareholders (unless
                        the bylaws require otherwise) if the new date, time, or place is announced before adjournment. But new notice is required if a new record date is or must be fixed under section 7.07(c). If a new record date is or must be fixed,
                        the 10-to-60-day notice requirement and all other requirements of section 7.05 must be complied with as notice is given to the persons who are shareholders as of the new record date. A new quorum for the adjourned meeting must
                        also be established. See section 7.25.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.25 provides that if a quorum exists for a meeting, it is deemed to continue to exist automatically for an adjourned meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting.

                        Section 7.06(a) permits any shareholder to waive any notice required by section 7.05 by a written waiver, signed by the shareholder and delivered to the corporation. A waiver is effective even though it is signed at or after the time set for the meeting.

                    <p>
                        A notice of shareholder meetings serves two principal purposes: (1) it advises shareholders of the date, time, and place of the annual or special meeting, and (2) in the case of a special meeting (or an annual meeting at which fundamental changes may
                        be made), it advises shareholders of the purposes of the meeting. If a shareholder attends a meeting, he has probably received some form of notice of the date, time, and place of the meeting whether from the corporation or from
                        another source. As a result, section 7.06(b)(1) provides that attendance at a meeting constitutes waiver of any failure to receive the notice or defects in the statement of the date, time, and place of any meeting. Defects waived
                        by attendance for this purpose include a failure to send the notice altogether, delivery to the wrong address, a misstatement of the date, time, or place of the meeting, and a failure to notice the meeting within the time periods
                        specified in section 7.05(a). If a shareholder believes that the defect in or failure of notice was in some way prejudicial, he may preserve his objection by stating at the beginning of the meeting that he objects to holding the
                        meeting or transacting any business. If this objection is made, the corporation may correct the defect by sending proper notice to the shareholders for a subsequent meeting or by obtaining written waivers of notice from all shareholders
                        who did not receive the notice required by section 7.05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For purposes of this section, "attendance" at a meeting involves the presence of the shareholder in person or by proxy. A shareholder who attends a meeting solely for the purpose of objecting to the notice may be counted as present for purposes of determining
                        whether a quorum is present. See the Official Comment to section 7.25.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the case of special meetings, or annual meetings at which fundamental corporate changes are considered, a second purpose of the notice is to tell shareholders what is to be considered at the meeting. An objection that a particular matter is not within
                        the stated purposes of the meeting obviously cannot be raised until the matter is presented. Thus section 7.06(b)(2) provides that a shareholder waives this kind of objection if he fails to object promptly after the matter is first
                        presented. If this objection is made, the corporation may correct the defect by sending proper notice to the shareholders for a subsequent meeting or obtaining written waivers of notice from all shareholders. Of course, whether
                        or not a specific matter is within a stated purpose of a meeting is ultimately a matter for judicial determination, typically in a suit to invalidate action taken at the meeting brought by a shareholder who was not present at the
                        meeting or who was present at the meeting and preserved his objection under section 7.06(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of both waiver rules in section 7.06(b) is to require shareholders with technical objections to holding the meeting or considering a specific matter to raise them at the outset and not reserve them to be raised only if they are unhappy with
                        the outcome of the meeting. The rules set forth in this section differ in some respects from the waiver rules for directors set forth in section 8.23 where a waiver is inferred if the director acquiesces in the action taken at
                        a meeting even if he raised a technical objection to the notice of a meeting at the outset.

                        Other sections of the Model Act require that shareholders who are not entitled to vote are entitled to notice of meetings at which certain fundamental corporate changes are to be considered. See sections 10.03, 11.03, 12.02, and 14.02. In order to obtain
                        an effective waiver of notice for these meetings under this section, waivers must be obtained from the nonvoting shareholders who are entitled to notice as well as from the voting shareholders.

                        Section 7.07 authorizes the board of directors to fix record dates for any action unless the bylaws themselves fix or provide for the fixing of a record date. A separate record date may be established for each voting group entitled to vote separately
                        on a matter at a meeting, or a single record date may be established for all voting groups entitled to participate in the meeting. If neither the bylaws nor the board of directors fix a record date for a specific action, the section
                        of this Act that deals with that action itself fixes the record date. For example, section 7.05(d), relating to giving notice of a meeting, provides that the record date for determining who is entitled to notice of a meeting (if
                        not fixed by the directors or the bylaws) is the close of business on the day before the date the corporation first gives notice to shareholders of the meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A record date may not be fixed more than 70 days before the meeting or action in question and may not be fixed retroactively. Once set, the same record date may be utilized for an adjournment of the meeting that reconvenes within 120 days after the date
                        fixed for the original meeting or the board of directors may fix a new record date. If the adjourned meeting takes place more than 120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting, section 7.07(c) requires that a new record
                        date be fixed. But if an adjournment is ordered by a court, section 7.07(d) allows the court to provide that the original record date continues to be applicable or to fix a different date. In any event, if a different record date
                        is or must be fixed under this section, section 7.05 requires that new notice be given to the persons who are shareholders as of the new record date, and section 7.25 requires that a quorum be reestablished for that meeting.

                        Section 7.09 permits shareholders to participate in annual and special shareholder meetings by means of remote communication, such as over the Internet or through telephone conference calls, subject to the conditions set forth in section 7.09(b) and any
                        other guidelines and procedures that the board of directors adopts. This would include the use of electronic ballots to the extent authorized by the board of directors. This authorization extends as well to anyone to whom such
                        shareholder has granted a proxy. Section 7.09 does not eliminate the requirement that corporations hold meetings at a physical location. See sections 7.01 and 7.02. Section 7.09 expressly provides that participation by remote means
                        is permitted only if it is authorized by the board of directors. This limitation is meant to ensure that the board of directors has the sole discretion to determine whether to allow shareholders to participate by means of remote
                        communication. Thus, a corporation may not be compelled to allow such participation either through amendments to the bylaws, shareholder resolutions, or otherwise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.09 allows the board of director s to limit participation by means of remote communication to all share holders of a particular class or series, but does not permit the board of directors to limit such participation to particular shareholders
                        within a class or series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.09 requires the board of directors to implement certain procedures when allowing shareholder participation by means of remote communication. First, the board of directors must create reasonable measures for verifying those entitled to vote.
                        Second, the board of directors must institute reasonable measures to ensure that all shareholders and their proxies within the authorized class or series have the opportunity to participate in the meeting, including measures that
                        provide them with an opportunity to communicate with management and other shareholders present at the meeting, and to read or hear the proceedings. While this provision is aimed at approximating as much as possible shareholder
                        participation in person or by proxy, including interacting with management during the meeting, it does not require that all can so participate and interact. In addition, Section 7.09 is not intended to expand the rights to participate
                        in meetings or otherwise alter the ability of the board of directors or the chair to conduct meetings pursuant to section 7.08 in a manner that is fair and orderly. For example, many corporations limit or cut-off shareholder comments
                        and, if such practice is fair to shareholders consistent with section 7.08, such practice is not changed by section 7.09. The two requirements under section 7.09(b) reflect the minimum deemed necessary to safeguard the integrity
                        of the shareholders' meeting. Section 7.09 specifically gives the board of directors the flexibility and discretion to adopt additional guidelines and procedures for allowing shareholders to participate in a meeting by means of
                        remote communication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to give corporations the flexibility to choose the most efficient means of remote communication, the board may require that shareholders communicate their desire to participate by a certain date and condition the provision of remote communication
                        or the form of communication to be used on the affirmative response of a certain number or proportion of shareholders eligible to participate. If the board of directors authorizes shareholder participation by means of remote communication

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    <p>
                        Section 7.20 requires the preparation of a list of shareholders entitled to notice of a meeting and requires that this list be made available on request to shareholders within two business days after the meeting notice is given.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The list of shareholders is often referred to as the "voting list" and usually the list will include only the names of those shareholders entitled to vote at the meeting. The list, however, must also include the names and shareholdings of shareholders
                        of nonvoting shares if they are entitled to notice of the meeting by reason of the nature of the actions proposed to be taken at the meeting. See section 7.05 and its Official Comment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Making the list of shareholders available before the meeting marks a change from the 1969 version of the Model Act. Through this device, a shareholder may learn the identity of the owners of substantial blocks of shares or the owners of shares similarly
                        situated and communicate with them to see if his concerns are shared and should be pursued.

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The list must generally be available for inspection two business days after notice of the meeting is given and continuously thereafter until the meeting occurs. If, however, notice of the meeting is waived by all the shareholders, the list need be available
                        only at the meeting itself under section 7.20(c) unless one or more waivers are conditioned upon receipt of the list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.20(b) permits the list to be maintained either at the corporation's principal office or at another location in the city in which the meeting is to be held, the precise location to be designated in the notice of meeting. If the corporation changes
                        the location of its annual meeting, it thus may correspondingly change the location of the list of shareholders pursuant to this subsection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.20(c) also requires a copy of the shareholders' list to be available at the meeting itself for inspection. This list may be used to determine attendance, the presence or absence of a quorum, and the right to vote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.20 does not require the list of shareholders to be in any particular form. It may be maintained, for example, in electronic form. If the list is maintained in other than written form, however, suitable equipment must be provided so that a comprehensible
                        list may be inspected by a shareholder as permitted by this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.20 creates a corporate obligation rather than an obligation imposed upon a corporate officer. If the corporation fails to prepare the list or refuses to permit a shareholder to inspect it, either before the meeting as required by section 7.20(b)
                        or at the meeting itself as required by section 7.20(c), a shareholder may apply to the appropriate court under section 7.20(d) for a summary order permitting inspection of the list; the court may further order the meeting to be
                        postponed for a reasonable time. If the court orders a copy of the list to be provided to the shareholders, the copying is at the corporation's expense; if the corporation produces the list voluntarily pursuant to section 7.20(b)
                        or (c), any inspection and copying are at the shareholder's expense.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This judicial remedy is the only sanction for violation of section 7.20 since section 7.20(e) provides that the failure to prepare, maintain, or produce the list does not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.20(b) permits shareholders to "inspect" the list without limitation, but permits the shareholder to "copy" the list only if the shareholder complies with the requirement of section 16.02(c), that the demand be "made in good faith and for a proper
                        purpose." The right to copy the list includes, if reasonable, the right to receive a copy of the list upon payment of a reasonable charge. See sections 16.03(b) and (c). The distinction between "inspection" and "copying" set forth
                        in section 7.20(b) reflects an accommodation between competing considerations of permitting shareholders access to the list before a meeting and possible misuse of the list.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.20 creates a right of shareholders to inspect a list of shareholders in advance of and at a meeting that is independent of the rights of shareholders to inspect corporate records under chapter 16A. A shareholder may obtain the right to inspect
                        the list of shareholders as provided in chapter 16A without regard to the provisions relating to the pendency of a meeting in section 7.20, and similarly the limitations of chapter 16A are not applicable to the right of inspection
                        created by section 7.20 except to the extent the shareholder seeks to copy the list in advance of the meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right to inspect under chapter 16A is also broader in the sense that in some circumstances the shareholder may be entitled to receive copies of the documents he may inspect. See section 16.03.

                        Section 7.2(a) provides that each outstanding share, regardless of class, is entitled to one vote per share unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation. See section 6.01 and its Official Comment. The articles of incorporation may provide
                        for multiple or fractional votes per share, and may provide that some classes of shares are nonvoting on some or all matters, or that some classes have multiple or fractional votes per share while other classes have a single vote
                        per share or different multiple or fractional votes per share, or that some classes constitute one or more separate voting groups and are entitled to vote separately on the matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The articles of incorporation may also authorize the board of directors to create classes or series of shares with preferential rights, which may be voting or nonvoting in whole or in part. See section 6.02 and its Official Comment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fractional or multiple votes per share, or nonvoting shares, are often used in the planning of business ventures, particularly closely held ventures, when the contributions of participants vary in kind or quality. It is possible through these devices,
                        for example, to give persons with relatively small financial contributions a relatively large voting power within the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The power to vary or condition voting power is also often used to give increased protection to financial interests in the corporation. It is customary, for example, to make classes of shares with preferential rights nonvoting, but the power to vote may
                        be granted to those classes if distributions are omitted for a specified period. This conditional right to vote may permit the class of shares with preferential rights to vote separately as a voting group to elect one or more directors
                        or to vote with the shares having general voting rights in the election of the directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to reflect the possibility that shares may have multiple or fractional votes per share, all provisions relating to quorums, voting, and similar matters in the Model Act are phrased in terms of "votes" rather than "shares."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the last sentence of section 7.21(a), the power to vote cannot be granted generally to nonshareholders. The statutes of some states permit bondholders to be given the power to vote under certain specified circumstances; this option is not available
                        under the Model Act. But creditors may in effect be given the power to vote, e.g., by creating a special class of redeemable voting shares for them, by creating a voting trust at the time the credit is extended with power in the
                        creditors to name the voting trustees, by registering the shares in the name of the creditors as pledgees with power to vote, or by granting the creditors a revocable or irrevocable proxy to vote some or all of the outstanding
                        shares. See the Official Comment to section 7.22.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.21(b) prohibits the voting of shares held by a domestic or foreign corporation that is itself a majority-owned subsidiary of the corporation issuing the shares. The purpose of this prohibition is to prevent management from using a corporate
                        investment to perpetuate itself in power. Similar public policy considerations may be present in situations where the issuing corporation owns a large but not a majority interest in the corporation voting the shares. The inclusion
                        of section 7.21(b) is not intended to affect the possible application of common law principles that may invalidate circular holding situations not within its literal prohibition. As to the possible existence of these common law
                        principles, see, e.g., Cleveland Trust Co. v. Eaton, 11 Ohio Misc. 151, 229 N.E.2d 850 (1967), rev'd on the basis of statutory amendment, 20 Ohio St.2d 129, 256 N.E.2d 198 (1970). The phrase "absent special circumstances" is included
                        to enable a court to permit the voting of shares where it deems that the purpose of the section is not violated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.21(c) makes the prohibition against voting of circularly-owned shares of section 7.21(b) inapplicable to shares held in a fiduciary capacity. Compare DEL. GEN. CORP. LAW
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 160(c). The Ohio statute involved in the Eaton case authorized a bank to vote its own shares that were held by it in a fiduciary capacity. A state may grant or prohibit such voting by another statute; section 7.21(c)
                        provides only that such voting is not prohibited by the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Redeemable shares are often redeemed in connection with a transaction such as a merger or the issuance of a new senior class of shares that requires shareholder approval. Section 7.21(d) avoids subjecting a transacting to approval by a class of redeemable
                        shares that will be redeemed as a result of the transaction if adequate provision has been made to ensure that the holders of the redeemable shares will in fact receive the amount payable to them on redemption.

                        Section 7.22 provides that shareholders may vote in person or by proxy and establishes the basic rules for appointing a proxy. As business organizations have increased in size and complexity, the number of shareholders has also increased. As a result,
                        proxy voting is an essential step in the governance of many corporations.

                        The word "proxy" is often used ambiguously, sometimes referring to the grant of authority to vote, sometimes to the document granting the authority, and sometimes to the person to whom the authority is granted. In the revised Model Act the word "proxy"
                        is used only in the last sense; the term "appointment form" is used to describe the document appointing the proxy; and the word "appointment" is used to describe the grant of authority to vote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A shareholder may appoint a proxy to vote for him simply by signing an appointment form, either personally or by his attorney-in-fact. The appointment is effective when it is received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to receive and
                        tabulate votes. The proxy has the same power to vote as that possessed by the shareholder, unless the appointment form contains an express limitation on the power to vote or direction as to how to vote the shares on a particular
                        matter, in which event the corporation must tabulate the votes in a manner consistent with that limitation or direction. See section 7.22(h).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An appointment form that contains no expiration date is valid for 11 months. See section 7.22(c). This ensures that in the normal course a new appointment will be solicited at least once every 12 months. But an appointment form may validly specify a longer
                        period if the parties agree.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The appointment of a proxy is essentially the appointment of an agent and is revocable in accordance with the principles of agency law unless it is "coupled with an interest." See section 7.22(d). Thus, an appointment may be revoked either expressly or
                        by implication, as when a shareholder later executes a second appointment form inconsistent with an earlier one, or attends the meeting in person and seeks to vote on his own behalf. The revised Model Act does not attempt to codify
                        these common law principles of agency law.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While death or incapacity of the appointing shareholder revokes an agency appointment under common law principles, section 7.22(e) modifies the common law rule to provide that the corporation may accept the vote of the proxy until the appropriate corporate
                        officer or agent receives notice of the shareholder's death or incapacity. In view of the widespread dispersal of shareholders in many corporations, it is not feasible for the corporation to learn of these events independently
                        of notice. On the other hand, section 7.22(e) does not affect the validity of the proxy appointment or its manner of exercise as between the proxy and the personal representatives of the decedent or incompetent. That relationship
                        is governed by the law of agency independent of the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.22(d) deals with the irrevocable appointment of a proxy. The general test adopted is the common law test that all appointments are revocable unless "coupled with an interest." But section 7.22(d) provides considerable certainty since it describes
                        several accepted forms of relationship as examples of "proxies coupled with an interest." These examples are not exhaustive and other arrangements may also be held to be "coupled with an interest." See Comment, "The Irrevocable
                        Proxy and Voting Control of Small Business Corporations," 98 U. PA. L. REV. 401, 405-7 (1950); see generally I RESTATEMENT OF AGENCY (SECOND)

                        Section 7.22(f) provides that an irrevocable proxy is revoked when the interest with which it was coupled is extinguished - for example, by repayment of the loan or release of the pledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A transferee for value of shares that are subject to an irrevocable appointment takes free of the appointment if (1) he did not know of the existence of the appointment and (2) the existence of the irrevocable appointment was not noted conspicuously on
                        the certificate or information statement. See section 7.22(g). Under this subsection, both the appointment and the irrevocable nature of the appointment must conspicuously appear on the certificate.

                        The second sentence of subsection (b), which was contained in substance in former G.S. 55-68, was added to the Model Act's provisions to broaden the permissible forms of proxies. The use of a variety of methods of modern communication to transmit a proxy
                        is especially useful for public corporations.

                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in the second sentence of subsection (c) by changing "longer" to "different" to permit proxy appointments for less than 11 months.

                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (f) to provide that an irrevocable proxy appointment is revocable (but not automatically revoked) when the interest with which it is coupled is extinguished. The drafters concluded that the automatic revocation
                        in the Model Act could create reliance problems for third parties.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Traditionally, a corporation recognizes only the registered owner as the owner of shares. Indeed, section 1.40 defines "shareholder" basically as the registered owner of shares. But it has become a common practice for persons purchasing shares to have
                        them registered in the "street name" of a broker-dealer or other financial institution, principally to facilitate transfer by eliminating the need for the beneficial owner's signature and delivery. In addition, in order to avoid
                        the burdens of processing securities transfers, which caused a crisis in the securities industry in the late 1960s, a system of securities depositories (defined as "clearing corporations" in section 8-102(3) of the UNIFORM COMMERCIAL
                        CODE) has been developed. In this system, financial institutions deposit securities with the depository, which becomes the registered owner of the shares. Transfers between depositories are then accomplished by book entry of the
                        depository. As a result, there may be two entities interposed between the corporation and the beneficial owner with the depository being the registered owner for the account of the brokerage firm that in turn holds the shares for
                        the account of the beneficial owner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of section 7.23 is to facilitate direct communication between the corporation and the beneficial owner by authorizing the corporation to create a procedure for bypassing both the registered owner and intermediate brokerage firms. The adoption
                        of this procedure is discretionary with each corporation and affirmative action by the corporation is necessary to accomplish it. The procedure is also discretionary with the shareholder, who must elect to follow the applicable
                        procedure prescribed by the corporation. The shareholder retains all of his rights except those granted to the beneficial owner.

                    <p>
                        The corporation may limit or qualify the procedure as it deems appropriate. For example, the corporation may:

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Corporations are often asked to accept written instrument as evidence of action by a shareholder. These instruments usually involve appointment forms for a proxy to vote the shares, but may also include waivers of notice, consents to action without a
                        meeting, requests for a special meeting of shareholders, and similar instruments involving action by the shareholders. Usually the corporation or its officers will have no personal knowledge of the circumstances under which the
                        instrument was executed and no way of verifying whether the signature on the instrument is in fact the signature of the shareholder. This problem is particularly acute in large corporations with thousands of shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.24 establishes general rules permitting the corporation and its officers or agents to accept these instruments if they appear to be executed by the shareholder or by a person who has authority to execute the instrument for the shareholder and
                        they are accompanied by whatever authenticating evidence the corporation reasonably requests. The rules set forth in this section are not exclusive and may be supplemented by additional rules established by the corporation pursuant
                        to section 2.06(b). Section 7.24(a) authorizes acceptance of an instrument if the name appearing on the instrument "corresponds" to the name of the shareholder, while section 7.24(b) permits the acceptance of an instrument executed
                        by a person other than the shareholder if there is a designation or evidence of the capacity of the person executing the instrument that indicates the act of the person is the act of the shareholder. On the other hand, section
                        7.24(c) permits rejection of an instrument if the officer or agent tabulating votes has a "reasonable basis for doubt" about the validity of the signature or about the authority of the person acting on behalf of the shareholder.
                        These principles are described in greater detail below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of section 7.24 is to protect the corporation and its officers or agents from liability for damages to the shareholder if action is taken in accordance with the section. Thus section 7.24(d) provides that there is no liability to the shareholder
                        if the corporation's officer or agent, acting in good faith, accepts an instrument that meets the requirements of section 7.24(a) or (b), even if it turns out that the execution was invalid or unauthorized; similarly, no liability
                        exists if the officer or agent, again acting in good faith, rejects an instrument because of a "reasonable basis for doubt," even though it turns out that the instrument was properly executed by the shareholder. But section 7.24
                        does not address the question whether an action was properly or improperly taken or approved, and section 7.24(e) makes clear that the validity or invalidity of corporate action is ultimately a matter for judicial resolution through
                        review of the results of an election in a suit to enjoin or compel corporate action. It is contemplated that any such suit will be brought promptly, typically before the corporate action is consummated or the corporation's position
                        otherwise changes in reliance on the vote, and that any suit that is not brought promptly under the circumstances would normally be barred because of laches.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, section 7.24 does not address the liability of the proxy to the shareholder for exercising authority beyond that granted to him or for disobeying instructions. These matters are governed by the law of agency and not by section 7.24.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The American Society of Corporate Secretaries has established principles for the acceptance of proxy appointments in routine elections in which there is no proxy contest. Many of the examples of the application of section 7.24 set forth below are based
                        on these principles.

                            "J. Foster Smith," "J. Smith," "J.F. Smith," "J.F.S.," "J.S.," "John F.," and even simply "Smith." Similarly, if "John Smith" is the name of the shareholder, "John F. Smith" and "J. Foster Smith" are also acceptable.

                                    signed by or on behalf of fewer than all the persons named. This conclusion proceeds on the assumption that the signer or signers have authority to act for the others and there is nothing on the face of the instrument

                        The phrase "reasonable basis for doubt" about the validity of a signature or about the signer's authority creates an objective standard for the exercise of the authority granted by section 7.24(c) to reject proffered instruments. In the absence of a proxy
                        fight or a seriously contested issue, instruments should be rejected only if there seems to be no basis for finding the execution regular on its face. In a proxy fight or other contested issue, the possibility of illegal or unauthorized
                        execution is greatly increased, and a more cautious attitude should therefore be adopted. The following are examples in which a "reasonable basis for doubt" could be found to exist:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        b. The shares are registered in the name of "Ellen Smith, a Minor" or "John Smith, Custodian for Ellen Smith, a Minor," and the instrument is executed by "Ellen Smith." There is no "reasonable basis for doubt," however, if the instrument is accompanied
                        by evidence satisfactory to the corporation that the shareholder is no longer a minor.

                    <p>
                        c. A proxy appointment is received that is regular on its face, and the secretary or other corporate officer or agent receives a telephone call from a person who identifies himself as the shareholder and says either that he wishes to revoke the appointment
                        or that he did not authorize its original execution.

                    <p>
                        d. Shares are registered in the name of two or more persons as co-owners, the instrument is executed by fewer than all of them, and the instrument shows on its face that not all the registered owners granted authority to the signers, as where the instrument
                        states that it was not possible to obtain all the coowners' signatures or that some refused to sign. For the normal rule of acceptability of proxies executed by fewer than all co-owners, however, see section 7.24(b)(5) and part
                        2.e of this Official Comment.

                    <p>
                        e. The corporation receives a copy of letters of appointment of a receiver, executor, administrator or other fiduciary, and the instrument is executed in the name of the shareholder rather than by the fiduciary.
                    </p>

                        As indicated in the Official Comment to section 7.22, a proxy is simply an agent of the shareholder, and his appointment therefore involves primarily the law of agency. The law of agency determines the rights and duties of the shareholder and the proxy,
                        and it is important to recognize that section 7.24 is not intended to affect these rights and duties. Rather, it recognizes that the great bulk of instruments executed in the name of a shareholder or on his behalf are in fact authorized
                        and the corporation and its officers should be encouraged to accept them rather than to adopt unduly narrow requirements.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT, =nl 2016 REVISION

                    <p>
                        Section 7.25 establishes general quorum and voting requirements for voting groups for purposes of the Act. As defined in section 1.40, a "voting group" consists of all shares of one or more classes or series that under the articles of incorporation or
                        the Act are entitled to vote and be counted together collectively on a matter. Shares entitled to vote "generally" on a matter (that is, all shares entitled to vote on the matter by the articles of incorporation or the Act that
                        do not expressly have the right to be counted separately) are a single voting group. On most matters coming before shareholders' meetings, only a single voting group, consisting of a class of voting shares, will be involved, and
                        action on such a matter is effective when approved by that voting group pursuant to section 7.25. See section 7.26(a).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.25 covers quorum and voting requirements for all actions by the shareholders of a corporation with a single class of voting shares. It also covers quorum and voting requirements for a matter on which only a class or series of shares is entitled
                        to vote under the articles of incorporation, for example, when a class with preferential rights may vote to elect directors because of a default in the payment of dividends (a vote which is often described as a "class vote"). Finally,
                        section 7.25 also covers quorum and voting requirements for a matter on which both common and preferred shares or separate classes or series of common or preferred shares are entitled to vote, either together as a single voting
                        group under the articles of incorporation or separately as two or more voting groups under either the articles of incorporation or the Act. See section 7.26(b).

                    <p>
                        Under the Act, classes or series of shares are generally not entitled to vote separately by voting group except to the extent specifically authorized by the articles of incorporation. But sections 9.21, 9.32, 10.04, and 11.04 of the Act grant classes
                        or series of shares the right to vote separately when fundamental changes are proposed that may adversely affect that class or series. Section 10.04(c) further provides that when two or more classes or series are affected by an
                        amendment covered by section 10.04 in essentially the same way, the classes or series are grouped together and must vote as a single voting group rather than as multiple voting groups on the matter, unless otherwise provided in
                        the articles of incorporation or required by the board of directors. Section 7.25(f) provides that the group voting rule of section 10.04(c), including the ability to vary that rule in the articles of incorporation or by action
                        of the board of directors, also applies to the group voting provisions in sections 9.21, 9.32, and 11.04. Under the Act even a class or series of shares that is expressly described as nonvoting under the articles of incorporation
                        may be entitled to vote separately on an amendment to the articles of incorporation that affects the class or series in a designated way. See section 10.04(d).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the provisions of the Act, separate voting by voting group may be authorized by the articles of incorporation (except that the statutory privilege of voting by separate voting groups cannot be diluted or reduced). On some matters, the board
                        of directors may condition its submission of matters to shareholders on their approval by specific voting groups designated by the board of directors. Sections 7.25 and 7.26 establish the mechanics by which all voting by single
                        or multiple voting groups is carried out.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some situations, shares of a single class or series may be entitled to vote in two different voting groups. See the Official Comment to section 7.26.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A corporation's determination of the voting groups entitled to vote, and the quorum and voting requirements applicable to that determination, should be determined separately for each matter coming before a meeting. As a result, different quorum and voting
                        requirements may be applicable to different portions of a meeting, depending on the matter being considered. In the normal case where only a single voting group is entitled to vote on all matters coming before a meeting of shareholders,
                        a single quorum and voting requirement will usually be applicable to the entire meeting. To reflect the possibility that shares may have multiple or fractional votes per share, the provisions relating to quorums are phrased in
                        terms of votes represented by shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 7.25(b), once a share is present at a meeting, it is deemed present for quorum purposes throughout the meeting. Thus, a voting group may continue to act despite the withdrawal of persons having the power to vote one or more shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shares owned by a shareholder who comes to the meeting to object on grounds of lack of notice are considered present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Similarly, shares owned by a shareholder who attends a meeting solely for purposes
                        of raising the objection that a quorum is not present are considered present for purposes of determining the presence of a quorum. Attendance at a meeting, however, does not constitute a waiver of other objections to the meeting
                        such as the lack of notice. Such waivers are governed by section 7.06(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a new record date is set, new notice must be given to holders of shares of a voting group and a quorum must be established from within the holders of shares of that voting group as of the new record date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.25(c) provides that an action (other than the election of directors, which is governed by section 7.28) is approved by a voting group at a meeting at which a quorum is present if the votes cast in favor of the action exceed the votes cast opposing
                        the action, unless the articles of incorporation require a greater number of votes. This default rule differs from a formulation appearing in some state statutes that an action is approved at a meeting at which a quorum is present
                        if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares represented at that meeting. That formulation in effect treats abstentions as negative votes; the Act treats them truly as abstentions. For example, if a corporation
                        (that has not, through the articles of incorporation, modified quorum and voting requirements) has 1,000 shares of a single class outstanding, each share entitled to cast one vote, a quorum consists of 501 shares; if 600 shares
                        are represented at the meeting and the vote on a proposed action is 280 in favor, 225 opposed, and 95 abstaining, the action would not be approved in a state following the formulation that treats abstentions as negative votes because
                        fewer than a majority of the 600 shares attending voted in favor of the action. Under section 7.25(c) the action would be approved and not be defeated by the 95 abstaining votes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The articles of incorporation may modify the quorum and voting requirements of section 7.25 for a single voting group or for all voting groups entitled to vote on any matter. The articles of incorporation may increase the quorum and voting requirements
                        to any extent desired up to and including unanimity, subject to section 7.27. They may also require that shares of different classes or series are entitled to vote separately or together on specific issues or provide that actions
                        are approved only if they receive the favorable vote of a majority of the shares of a voting group present at a meeting at which a quorum is present. The articles may also decrease the quorum requirement as desired, subject to
                        section 7.25(a) and section 7.27.

                        that special quorum and voting requirements can be established by a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, as well as by the articles of incorporation or the provisions of this Act.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.26(a) provides that when a matter is to be voted upon by a single voting group, action is taken when the voting group votes upon the action as provided in section 7.25. In most instances the single voting group will consist of all the shares
                        of the class or classes entitled to vote by the articles of incorporation; voting by two or more voting groups as contemplated by section 7.26(b) is the exceptional case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.26(b) basically requires that if more than one voting group is entitled to vote on a matter, favorable action on a matter is taken only when it is voted upon favorably by each voting group, counted separately. Implicit in this section are the
                        concepts that (1) different quorum and voting requirements may be applicable to different matters considered at a single meeting and (2) different quorum and voting requirements may be applicable to different voting groups voting
                        on the same matter. See the Official Comment to section 7.25. Thus, each group entitled to vote must independently meet the quorum and voting requirements established by section 7.25. But if a quorum is present for one or more
                        voting groups but not for all voting groups, section 7.26(b) provides that the voting groups for which a quorum is present may vote upon the matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A single meeting, furthermore, may consider matters on which action by several voting groups is required and also matters on which only a single voting group may act. Action may be taken on the matters on which the single voting group may act even though
                        no quorum is present to take action on other matters. For example, in a corporation with one class of nonvoting shares with preferential rights ("preferred shares") and one class of general voting shares without preferential rights
                        ("common shares"), a matter to be considered at the annual meeting may be a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation that reduces the cumulative dividend right of the preferred shares (a matter on which the preferred
                        shares have a statutory right to vote as a separate voting group). Other matters to be considered may include the election of directors and the appointment of an auditor, both matters on which the preferred shares have no vote.
                        If a quorum of the voting group consisting of the common shares but no quorum of the voting group consisting of the preferred shares is present, the common shares may proceed to elect directors and appoint the auditor. The common
                        shares voting group may also vote to approve the proposed amendment to the articles of the incorporation, but that amendment will not be approved until the preferred shares voting group also votes to approve the amendment.

                    <p>
                        In many multiple voting group situations under the Model Act, proposals are adopted only if a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by each voting group approve the proposal. This percentage of votes is higher than that required by section 7.25,
                        and is required, for example, under sections 10.03(e)(1) and 10.04(b) for all amendments to articles of incorporation that create dissenters' rights with respect to part or all of the shares of the voting group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As described in section 7.26(b), if voting by multiple voting groups is required, the votes of members of each voting group must be separately tabulated. Normally, each class or series of shares will participate in only a single voting group. But since
                        holders of shares entitled by the articles of incorporation to vote generally on a matter are always entitled to vote in the voting group consisting of the general voting shares, in some instances classes or series of shares may
                        be entitled to be counted simultaneously in two voting groups. This will occur whenever a class or series of shares entitled to vote generally on a matter under the articles of incorporation is affected by the matter in a way that
                        gives rise to the right to have its vote counted separately as an independent voting group under the Act. For example, assume that corporation Y has outstanding one class of general voting shares without preferential rights ("common
                        shares"), 500 shares issued, and one class of shares with preferential rights ("preferred shares"), 100 shares issued, that also have full voting rights under the articles of incorporation, i.e., the preferred may vote for election
                        of directors and on all other matters on which common may vote. The preferred and the common therefore are part of the general voting group. The directors propose to amend the articles of incorporation to change the preferential
                        dividend rights of the preferred from cumulative to noncumulative. All shares are present at the meeting and they divide as follows on the proposal to adopt the amendment:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes - Common 230 - Preferred 80 No - Common 270 - Preferred 20. Both the preferred and the common are entitled to vote on the amendment to the articles of incorporation since they are part of a general voting group pursuant to the articles. But the vote
                        of the preferred is also entitled to be counted separately on the proposal by section 10.04(a)(4) of the Model Act. The result is that the proposal passes by a vote of 310 to 290 in the voting group consisting of the shares entitled
                        to vote generally and 80 to 20 in the voting group consisting solely of the preferred shares: (a) First voting group Yes: Common 230 Preferred

                        In this situation, in the absence of a special quorum requirement, a meeting could approve the proposal to amend the articles of incorporation if - and only if - a quorum of each voting group is present, i.e., at least 51 shares of preferred and 301 shares
                        of common and preferred were represented at the meeting.

                        Section 7.27(a) permits the articles of incorporation to increase the quorum or voting requirements for approval of an action by shareholders up to any desired amount including unanimity. These provisions may relate to ordinary or routine actions by the
                        general voting group (which otherwise may be acted upon under section 7.25 if the number of affirmative votes exceeds the number of negative votes at a meeting at which a quorum of that voting group is present) or to one or more
                        other voting groups or to actions for which the Model Act provides a greater voting requirement - for example, changes of a fundamental nature in the corporation like certain amendments to articles of incorporation (section 10.03),
                        mergers (section 11.03), sales of all or substantially all the property of a corporation not in the ordinary course of business (section 12.02), and dissolution (section 14.02). Generally, the Model Act requires these fundamental
                        changes to receive the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the proposal by each voting group entitled to vote thereon rather than by a majority of the shares voting affirmatively or negatively at
                        a meeting at which a quorum is present.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A provision that increases the requirement for approval of an ordinary matter or a fundamental change is usually referred to as a "supermajority" provision.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.27(b) requires any amendment of the articles of incorporation that adds, modifies, or repeals any supermajority provision to be approved by the greater of the proposed quorum and vote requirement or by the quorum and vote required by the articles
                        before their amendment. Thus, a supermajority provision that requires an 80 percent affirmative vote of all eligible votes of a voting group present at the meeting may not be removed from the articles of incorporation or reduced
                        in any way except by an 80 percent affirmative vote. If the 80 percent requirement is coupled with a quorum requirement for a voting group that shares representing two-thirds of the total votes must be present in person or by proxy,
                        both the 80 percent voting requirement and the two-thirds quorum requirement are immune from reduction except at a meeting of the voting group at which the two-thirds quorum requirement is met and the reduction is approved by an
                        80 percent affirmative vote. If the proposal is to increase the 80 percent voting requirement to 90 percent, that proposal must be approved by a 90 percent affirmative vote at a meeting of the voting group at which the two-thirds
                        quorum requirement is met; if the proposal is to increase the two-thirds quorum requirement to three-fourths without changing the 80 percent voting requirement, that proposal must be approved by an 80 percent affirmative vote at
                        a meeting of the voting group at which a three-fourths quorum requirement is met.

                        This section differs from the Model Act by permitting a bylaw adopted by the shareholders to establish greater quorum or voting requirements for shareholders. If adopted after July 1, 1990, such a bylaw must be approved by a quorum and vote sufficient
                        to amend the articles of incorporation for that purpose. Any such provision, whether in the articles of incorporation or in the bylaws, may not itself be amended by a quorum or vote less than the quorum or vote therein prescribed.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.28(a) provides that directors are elected by a plurality of the votes cast in an election of directors at a meeting at which a quorum is present of the voting group entitled to participate in the election. A "plurality" means that the individuals
                        with the largest number of votes are elected as directors up to the maximum number of directors to be chosen at the election. In elections in which several factions are competing within a voting group, the individuals elected may
                        have fewer than a majority of all the votes cast in the election. The articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation may, however, provide a different manner of election of directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire board of directors may be elected by a single voting group or the articles of incorporation may provide that different voting groups are entitled to elect a designated number or fraction of the board of directors. See section 8.04. Elections
                        are contested only within specific voting groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 7.28(b) each corporation may determine whether or not to elect its directors by cumulative voting. If directors are elected by different voting groups, the articles of incorporation may provide that specified voting groups are entitled to
                        vote cumulatively while others are not. Cumulative voting affects the manner in which votes may be cast by shares participating in the election but does not affect the plurality principle set forth in section 7.28(a).

                    <p>
                        Section 7.28(b) provides basically for an "opt in" election. A corporation has cumulative voting with respect to a voting group only if an affirmative provision to that effect appears in its articles of incorporation. Under section 7.28(c) this election
                        may be made simply by inserting a statement that "all directors are elected by cumulative voting" or "holders of class A shares are entitled to cumulate their votes," or words of similar import. The effect of such a statement is
                        to make applicable automatically the detailed provisions of subsections (c) and (d) describing the cumulative right to vote at elections of directors by the voting group or groups specified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.28(c) describes the mechanics of cumulative voting: each shareholder may multiply the number of votes he is entitled to cast (based on the number of shares held by him) by the number of directors to be elected by the voting group at the meeting
                        and may cast the product for a single candidate or distribute the product among two or more candidates. By casting all his votes for a single candidate or a limited number of candidates, a minority shareholder increases his voting
                        power and may be able to elect one or more directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.28(d) applies only if cumulative voting is potentially available under section 7.28(b). It is designed to ensure that all shareholders participating in the election understand the rules and to avoid the distortions that may be created when some
                        shareholders vote cumulatively while others do not. Cumulative voting will be employed if the notice of meeting or accompanying proxy statement conspicuously announces that a shareholder is entitled to cumulate his votes or a shareholder
                        who is entitled to vote gives notice to the corporation of his intent to do so at least 48 hours before the meeting. This notice puts the corporation and all shareholders who are entitled to vote in the election with that shareholder
                        on notice that voting will be on a cumulative basis. If this notice is given by any shareholder, all other shareholders who are part of the same voting group are entitled to vote cumulatively without giving further notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The proxy regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission require proxy statements to include a statement that persons have the right to vote cumulatively, if that is the case, and briefly to describe that right.

                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (a) to clarify that an agreement valid under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a07s55-7-31" target="_self">G.S. 55-7-31</a></cite> may modify the vote by which directors are elected.

                    <p>
                        For corporations incorporated on or after July 1, 1990, subsection (b) changes prior law, which mandated cumulative voting except with respect to corporations having shares listed on national securities exchanges or held by more than 2,000 holders of
                        record. A corporation may elect to retain cumulative voting by a provision in its articles of incorporation or in a shareholders' agreement complying with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a07s55-7-31" target="_self">G.S. 55-7-31</a></cite>.

                        The provisions of subdivision (d)(2) were modified from the Model Act to conform with prior law with respect to the manner of electing to vote cumulatively.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (e) is a transitional provision that preserves cumulative voting for substantially all corporations that had cumulative voting by law prior to July 1, 1990.

                        Requirements for Exercise of Cumulative Voting. - Under former G.S. 55-68, before the right of cumulative voting may be exercised, four things must be done: (1) A shareholder must announce in the open meeting, before the voting starts, that he intends
                        to vote cumulatively; (2) upon such an announcement, the chair must declare that all shares have the right to vote cumulatively; (3) the chair must announce the number of shares present in person or by proxy; and (4) the chair
                        must declare a recess of not less than one hour nor more than four hours, unless a different time period is unanimously agreed upon. Stancil v. Bruce Stancil Refrigeration, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C.

                        Same - Purpose. - The four requirements imposed by former G.S. 55-68(c) for the exercise of cumulative voting were designed, among other things, (1) to prevent a shareholder, by a surprise announcement of his intention to vote cumulatively, from taking
                        unfair advantage of other shareholders, and (2) to permit the shareholders an opportunity to determine how their votes may be distributed to their best advantage. Stancil v. Bruce Stancil Refrigeration, Inc.,

                        Lack of Recess. - Where the only person who could possibly have been prejudiced by the fact that no recess was taken after the announcement by the holder of 50% of the stock that he intended to vote cumulatively had been made was the owner of the other
                        50% of the stock, whose duty it was, as chairman of the meeting, to declare a recess, he would not be permitted, by his own violation of the statute, to defeat his fellow shareholder's proper exercise of a right to vote cumulatively,
                        nor to void an otherwise valid election. Stancil v. Bruce Stancil Refrigeration, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 344 S.E.2d 789, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 418</cite>,

                    <p>
                        A voting trust is a device by which one or more shareholders divorce the voting rights of their shares from the ownership, retaining the latter but transferring the former to one or more trustees in whom the voting rights of all the shareholders who are
                        parties to the trust are pooled. Section 7.30(a) provides a straightforward procedure for the creation of an enforceable voting trust and does not impose narrow or technical requirements. Typically, the voting trust provides that
                        all attributes of beneficial ownership other than the power to vote are retained by the voting trust beneficial owners. In addition, the voting trustees may issue to the voting trust beneficial owners voting trust certificates
                        which may be transferable in the same way as shares. Section 7.30 does not limit the duration of a voting trust, consistent with section 7.32 governing shareholder agreements generally. Section 7.30 permits participants to specify
                        limits but does not establish an automatic sunset provision as a matter of law. Section 7.30(c) addresses voting trusts entered into when the Act limited their duration to 10 years.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT, =nl 2016 REVISION
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Shareholders of some corporations, especially those that are closely held, frequently enter into agreements that govern the operation of the enterprise.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32 provides, within the context of the traditional corporate structure, legal certainty to such agreements that embody various aspects of the business arrangement established by the shareholders to meet their business and personal needs. The
                        subject matter of these arrangements includes governance of the entity, allocation of the economic return from the business, and other aspects of the relationships among shareholders, directors, and the corporation which are part
                        of the business arrangement. Section 7.32 also recognizes that many of the corporate norms contained in the Act were designed with an eye towards corporations whose management and share ownership are distinct. These functions are
                        often conjoined in some corporations, such as the close corporation. Thus, section 7.32 validates agreements among shareholders even when the agreements are inconsistent with the statutory norms contained in the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Importantly, section 7.32 only addresses the parties to the shareholder agreement, their transferees, and the corporation, and does not have any binding legal effect on the state, creditors, or other third persons.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32 supplements the other provisions of the Act. If an agreement is not in conflict with another section of the Act, no resort need be made to section 7.32 with its requirement of unanimity. For example, special provisions may be included in
                        the articles of incorporation or bylaws with less than unanimous shareholder agreement so long as such provisions are not in conflict with other provisions of the Act. Similarly, section 7.32 would not have to be relied upon to
                        validate typical buy-sell agreements among two or more shareholders or the covenants and other terms of a stock purchase agreement entered into in connection with the issuance of shares by a corporation.

                            Section 7.32(h)
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        An agreement authorized by section 7.32 is "not inconsistent with law" within the meaning of sections 2.02(b)(2) and 2.06(b) of the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The range of agreements validated by section 7.32(a) is expansive though not unlimited. Section 7.32 defines the types of agreements that can be validated largely by illustration. The seven specific categories that are listed are designed to cover some
                        of the most frequently used arrangements. There are numerous other arrangements that may be made, and section 7.32(a)(8) provides an additional category for any provisions that, in a manner inconsistent with any other provision
                        of the Act, otherwise govern the exercise of the corporate powers or the management of the business and affairs of the corporation or the relationship between and among the shareholders, the directors, and the corporation or any
                        of them, and are not contrary to public policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32(a) validates virtually all types of shareholder agreements that, in practice, normally concern shareholders and their advisors. Given that breadth, any provision that may be contained in the articles of incorporation with a majority vote
                        under sections 2.02(b)(2)(ii) and (iii), as well as under section 2.02(b)(4), may also be effective if contained in a shareholder agreement that complies with section 7.32.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of a shareholder agreement authorized by section 7.32(a) will often, in operation, conflict with the language of more than one section of the Act, and courts should in such cases construe all related sections of the Act flexibly and in
                        a manner consistent with the underlying intent of the shareholder agreement. Thus, for example, in the case of an agreement that provides for weighted voting by directors, every reference in the Act to a majority or other proportion
                        of directors should be construed to refer to a majority or other proportion of the votes of the directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the limits of section 7.32(a)(8) are left uncertain, there are provisions of the Act that may not be overridden if they reflect core principles of public policy with respect to corporate affairs. For example, a provision of a shareholder agreement
                        that purports to eliminate all of the standards of conduct established under section 8.30 might be viewed as contrary to public policy and thus not validated under section 7.32(a)(8). Similarly, a provision that exculpates directors
                        from liability more broadly than permitted by section 2.02(b)(4), or indemnifies them more broadly than permitted by section 2.02(b)(5), might not be validated under section 7.32 because of strong public policy reasons for the
                        statutory limitations on the right to exculpate directors from liability and to indemnify them. The validity of some provisions may depend upon the circumstances. For example, a provision of a shareholder agreement that limited
                        inspection rights under section 16.02 or the right to financial statements under section 16.20 might, as a general matter, be valid, but that provision might not be given effect if it prevented shareholders from obtaining information
                        necessary to determine whether directors of the corporation have satisfied the standards of conduct under section 8.30. The foregoing are examples and are not intended to be exclusive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As noted above, shareholder agreements otherwise validated by section 7.32 are not legally binding on the state, on creditors, or on other third parties. For example, an agreement that dispenses with the need to make corporate filings required by the
                        Act would be ineffective. Similarly, an agreement among shareholders that provides that only the president has authority to enter into contracts for the corporation would not, without more, be binding against third parties, and
                        ordinary principles of agency, including the concept of apparent authority, would continue to apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32 minimizes the formal requirements for a shareholder agreement so as not to restrict unduly the shareholders' ability to take advantage of the flexibility the section provides. Thus, it is not necessary to "opt in" to a special class of close
                        corporations to obtain the benefits of section 7.32. An agreement can be validated under section 7.32 whether it is set forth in the articles of incorporation, the bylaws or in a separate agreement, and regardless of whether section
                        7.32 is specifically referenced in the agreement. Where the corporation has a single shareholder, the requirement of an "agreement among the shareholders" is satisfied by the unilateral action of the shareholder in establishing
                        the terms of the agreement, evidenced by provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, or in a writing signed by the sole shareholder. Although a writing signed by all the shareholders is not required where the agreement
                        is contained in articles of incorporation or bylaws unanimously approved, it may be desirable to have all the shareholders actually sign the instrument to establish unequivocally their agreement. Similarly, although transferees
                        are bound by a valid shareholder agreement, subject to section 7.32(c), it may be desirable to obtain the affirmative written assent of the transferee at the time of the transfer. Section 7.32(b) also establishes and permits amendments
                        by less than unanimous agreement if the shareholder agreement so provides.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32(b) requires unanimous shareholder approval of the shareholder agreement regardless of entitlement to vote. Unanimity is required because an agreement authorized by section 7.32 can effect material organic changes in the corporation's operation
                        and structure, and in the rights and obligations of shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement that the shareholder agreement be made known to the corporation is the predicate for the requirement in section 7.32(c) that share certificates or information statements be legended to note the existence of the agreement. No specific form
                        of notification is required and the agreement need not be filed with the corporation. In the case of shareholder agreements in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the corporation will necessarily have notice. In the case of
                        a shareholder agreement outside the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the requirement of signatures by all of the shareholders should in virtually all cases be sufficient to make the corporation aware of the agreement, as one
                        or more signatories will normally also be a director or an officer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32(c) addresses the effect of a shareholder agreement on subsequent purchasers or transferees of shares. Typically, corporations with shareholder agreements also have restrictions on the transferability of the shares as authorized by section
                        6.27, thus lessening the practical effects of the problem in the context of voluntary transferees. Transferees of shares without knowledge of the agreement or those acquiring shares upon the death of an original participant in
                        a close corporation may, however, be heavily affected. Weighing the burdens on transferees against the burdens on the remaining shareholders in the enterprise, section 7.32(c) affirms the continued validity of the shareholder agreement
                        on all transferees, whether by purchase, gift, operation of law, or otherwise. Unlike restrictions on transfer, it may be impossible to enforce a shareholder agreement against less than all of the shareholders. Thus, under section
                        7.32, one who inherits shares subject to a shareholder agreement must continue to abide by the agreement. If that is not the desired result, care must be exercised at the initiation of the shareholder agreement to ensure a different
                        outcome, such as providing for a buy-back upon death.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where shares are transferred to a purchaser without knowledge of a shareholder agreement, the validity of the agreement is similarly unaffected, but the purchaser is afforded a rescission remedy against the seller. Under section 7.32(c), the time at which
                        notice to a purchaser is relevant for purposes of determining entitlement to rescission is the time when a purchaser acquires the shares rather than when a commitment is made to acquire the shares. If the purchaser learns of the
                        agreement after committing to purchase but before acquiring the shares, the purchaser may not proceed with the purchase and still obtain the benefit of the remedies in section 7.32(c). Under contract principles and the securities
                        laws, a failure to disclose the existence of a shareholder agreement may constitute the omission of a material fact and may excuse performance of the commitment to purchase. The term "purchaser" includes a person acquiring shares
                        upon initial issue or by transfer, and also includes a pledgee, for whom the time of purchase is the time the shares are pledged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32 addresses the underlying rights of shares and shareholders and the validity of shareholder action which redefines those rights, as contrasted with questions regarding entitlement to ownership of the security, competing ownership claims, and
                        disclosure issues. Consistent with this dichotomy, the rights and remedies available to purchasers under section 7.32(c) are independent of those provided by contract law, Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code, the securities
                        laws, and other laws outside the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to the related subject of restrictions on transferability of shares, note that section 7.32 does not directly address or validate such restrictions, which are governed instead by section 6.27 of the Act. However, if such restrictions are
                        adopted as a part of a shareholder agreement that complies with the requirements of section 7.32, a court should apply the concept of reasonableness under section 6.27 in determining the validity of such restrictions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32(c) contains an affirmative requirement that the share certificate or information statement for the shares be legended to note the existence of a shareholder agreement. No specified form of legend is required, and a simple statement that "[t]he
                        shares represented by this certificate are subject to a shareholder agreement" is sufficient. At that point, a purchaser must obtain a copy of the shareholder agreement from the transferor or proceed at the purchaser's peril. In
                        the event a corporation fails to legend share certificates or information statements, a court may, in an appropriate case, imply a cause of action against the corporation in favor of an injured purchaser without knowledge of a
                        shareholder agreement. The circumstances under which such a remedy would be implied, the proper measure of damages, and other attributes of and limitations on such an implied remedy are left to development in the courts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A purchaser who has no actual knowledge of a shareholder agreement and is not charged with knowledge by virtue of a legend on the certificate or information statement has a rescission remedy against the transferor (which would be the corporation in the
                        case of a new issue of shares).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the shares are certificated and duly legended, a purchaser is charged with notice of the shareholder agreement even if the purchaser never saw the certificate. In the case of uncertificated shares, however, the purchaser is not charged with notice
                        of the shareholder agreement unless a duly-legended information statement is delivered to the purchaser at or before the time of purchase. This different rule for uncertificated shares is intended to provide an additional safeguard
                        to protect innocent purchasers, and is necessary because section 6.26(b) of the Act and Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code permit delivery of statements after a transfer of shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32(d) recognizes that the terms of a shareholder agreement may provide for its termination upon the happening of a specified event or condition. An example may be when the corporation undergoes an initial public offering. This approach is consistent
                        with the broad freedom of contract provided to participants in such enterprises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32(e) provides a shift of liability from the directors to any person or persons in whom the discretion or powers otherwise exercised by the board of directors are vested under the shareholder agreement. A shareholder agreement which provides
                        for such a shift of responsibility, with the concomitant shift of liability provided by subsection
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 7.32(e), could also provide for exculpation from that liability to the extent otherwise authorized by the Act. The transfer of liability provided by subsection
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 7.32(e) covers liabilities imposed on directors "by law," which is intended to include liabilities arising under the Act, the common law, and statutory law outside the Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32(f) provides that shareholders shall not have personal liability for the debts of a corporation arising out of acts or omissions taken pursuant to a shareholder agreement validated by section 7.32. Section 7.32(g) authorizes shareholder agreements
                        for corporations that are in the process of being organized and do not yet have shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.32 does not limit the duration of a shareholder agreement. This approach is consistent with the wide freedom of contract provided to participants in such enterprises. For agreements entered into during a time that section 7.32 provided for a
                        10-year term if no other time limit was specified, section 7.32(h) provides that its duration will be governed by the provisions of section 7.32 concerning duration in force at the time the agreement became effective. This would
                        include, for example, both the default termination rule and the authority under former section 7.32(b)(2) that such an agreement's automatic 10-year term could be amended by all shareholders (unless the agreement had prohibited
                        such amendment).

                            Intent of Statute. - Former G.S. 55-73 was not intended to, and it did not, define "shareholders' agreements" to mean only those arrangements which were an attempt to treat the corporation as if it were a partnership or which arranged relationships in
                            a manner that would be appropriate only between partners. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The authorization of shareholders' agreements was a recognition of the needs of stockholders in a close corporation to be able to protect themselves from each other and from hostile invaders. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>,
                            246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The reason for phrasing the provisions of the statute mainly in the negative was to provide latitude to both the shareholders who enter into agreements which relate to the affairs of the corporation and to the courts which must construe and assess their
                            contracts. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).
                        </p>

                            The provisions of former G.S. 55-73 were designed to permit the management of close corporations by shareholders thereof who act by other than normal corporate procedures, and such actions by the shareholders, if so intended, must perforce bind the corporation.

                            Principal Provision as to Close Corporations. - With respect to close corporations, the heart of the North Carolina Business Corporation Act was former G.S. 55-73. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>,

                            By means of a shareholders' agreement a small group of investors who seek gain from direct participation in their business and not from trading its stock or securities in the open market can adopt the decision-making procedures of partnership, avoid the
                            consequences of majority rule (the standard operating procedure for corporations), and still enjoy the tax advantages and limited liability of a corporation. Such businesses are often called "incorporated partnerships." Blount
                            v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Shareholders' Agreement Defined. - A shareholders' agreement is a contract between shareholders which may apply broadly to the rights of the shareholders in conducting the business of the corporation, so long as their purposes are legal and not contrary
                            to public policy. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 225 S.E.2d 583 (1976), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a broad sense the term "shareholders' agreement" refers to any agreement among two or more shareholders regarding their conduct in relation to the corporation whose shares they own. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>,
                            246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Terms "bylaw" and "shareholders' agreement" are not mutually exclusive. Bylaws which are unanimously enacted by all the shareholders of a corporation are also shareholders' agreements. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>,
                            246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Function of Shareholders' Agreement. - Ordinarily the function of a shareholders' agreement is to avoid the consequences of majority rule or other statutory norms imposed by the corporate form. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>,
                            246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Partnership-Like Management Enabled. - The statute enables the shareholders of a close corporation by agreement in writing assented to by all to provide for the management and operation of the corporation in a manner similar to a partnership. Blount v.
                            Taft, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 225 S.E.2d 583 (1976), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                            No particular title, phrasing or content is necessary for a consensual arrangement among all shareholders to constitute a "shareholders' agreement." Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763
                            (1978).

                        <p>
                            Form and Substance May Vary. - The form and substance of a shareholders' agreement will vary with the nature of the business and the objectives of the parties. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246
                            S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Who May Be Party to Agreement. - A shareholders' agreement may be between stockholders in a corporation the shares of which are publicly traded or one whose shares are closely held. However, agreements among shareholders are primarily a feature of close
                            corporations. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                            Agreement as to Voting Is Valid Absent Fraud or Prejudice. - North Carolina is aligned with the majority of jurisdictions which hold that a contract entered into between corporate stockholders to which they agree to vote their stock in a specified manner,
                            including agreements for the election of directors and corporate officers, is not invalid, unless it is inspired by fraud or will prejudice the other stockholders. Wilson v. McClenny, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 121</cite>,
                            136 S.E.2d 569 (1964); Stein v. Capital Outdoor Adv., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 77</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 351 (1968).

                            Agreements for Future Management Must Be "Otherwise Lawful". - Both former G.S. 55-24 and G.S. 55-73 required that contemplated agreements providing for the future management and control of a corporation be "otherwise lawful." Wilson v. McClenny,
                            <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 121</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 569 (1964).

                        <p>
                            When Such Agreements Held Invalid. - Agreements providing for the future management and control of a corporation which violate the express charter or statutory provision, contemplate an illegal object, involve any fraud, oppression or wrong against other
                            stockholders or are made in consideration of a private benefit to the promisor, will be declared invalid. Wilson v. McClenny, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 121</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 569 (1964).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Invalidation of Agreements. - A shareholders' agreement is not valid and enforceable merely because it fits the specifications of this section. It can be invalidated under the law of contracts upon any ground which would entitle a party to such relief.
                            Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Burden of Proof of Valid Agreement. - Those who have the burden of proving a valid shareholders' agreement could ease this burden by offering an agreement in writing signed by all shareholders, or if embodied in the charter or bylaws, explicit designation
                            therein of a shareholders' agreement and provision for alteration of the agreement if different from the alteration or amendment provisions applicable to the charter or bylaw provisions which are not within the agreement. Blount

                            Enforcement of Agreements. - Agreements by shareholders to vote their shares so as to cause their corporation to take certain action are generally enforceable against the shareholders. Snyder v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 204</cite>,
                            266 S.E.2d 593 (1980).

                            Agreements Construed and Enforced Like Contracts. - Since consensual arrangements among shareholders are agreements - the products of negotiation - they should be construed and enforced like any other contract so as to give effect to the intent of the
                            parties as expressed in their agreements, unless they violate the express charter or statutory provision, contemplate an illegal object, involve fraud, oppression or wrong against other shareholders, or are made in consideration
                            of a private benefit to the promisor. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978); Snyder v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 204</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 593

                            Intent. - Subsection (b) of former G.S. 55-73 was intended to supply a legal framework within which partner-like arrangements having a reasonable business purpose could be worked out with substantial assurance of legal validity. Blount v. Taft,
                            <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 225 S.E.2d 583 (1976), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Subsection (b) of former G.S. 55-73 simply abrogated, as to agreements within its purview, certain judicial doctrines which had formerly invalidated particular shareholders' agreements on those grounds which the statute disallowed. Blount v. Taft,
                            <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                            Language in subsection (b) of former G.S. 55-73 was widely borrowed for the close corporations statutes of several other jurisdictions. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                            Effect of Subsection (b) of Former G.S. 55-73 Generally. - Subsection (b) of former G.S. 55-73 created no distinctions between a shareholders' agreement in which the parties sought to deal with the corporation as a partnership and any other stockholders'
                            agreement which related to any phase of the affairs of the corporation. It added nothing, either expressly or impliedly, to the words of the agreement; nor did it suspend the rules of contract law relating to its construction,
                            modification or rescission. It merely provided that a shareholders' agreement in which the parties sought to deal with affairs of the corporation in a manner which would be appropriate only between partners was not invalid
                            for that reason. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                            To meet the requirements of subsection (b) of former G.S. 55-73 for establishing a valid shareholders' agreement in a close corporation, there had to be an agreement in writing of all shareholders; but the writing could consist of a written provision
                            in the charter or bylaws of the corporation which could be based on an oral agreement which had been embodied therein. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 225 S.E.2d 583

                            Amendment of Agreement in Charter or Bylaws. - When parties to a shareholders' agreement choose to embody it in the charter or bylaws, it must be concluded that they intended for statutory or common-law norms governing amendment to apply, absent an expressed
                            intention to deviate from them. Blount v. Taft, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 472</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 763 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Section 7.40 deals with the procedural requirements applicable to derivative suits. A great deal of controversy has surrounded the derivative suit, and widely different perceptions as to the value and efficacy of this litigation continue to exist. On
                        the one hand, the derivative action has historically been the principal method of challenging allegedly improper, illegal, or unreasonable action by management. On the other hand, it has long been recognized that the derivative
                        suit may be instituted more with a view to obtaining a settlement favorable to the plaintiff and his attorney than to righting a wrong to the corporation (the so-called "strike suit").
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier versions of section 7.40, and similar statutes in many states, imposed a series of procedural requirements designed in part to deter or prevent strike suits. The FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, rule 23.1, also imposes procedural requirements
                        on derivative litigation brought in federal court. There has thus been a great deal of experience with procedural devices to control abuses of the derivative suit. Section 7.40 reflects a reappraisal of these devices in light of
                        major developments in corporate governance, the public demand for corporate accountability, and the corporate response in the form of greater independence and sense of responsibility in boards of directors.

                    <p>
                        The procedural requirements imposed by section 7.40 are as follows:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many statutes, including earlier versions of the Model Act, required the plaintiff to be a shareholder "of record." This limiting requirement was dropped in revising section 7.40, in light of the widespread use of street name or nominee ownership of shares.
                        At the same time, it was determined that the beneficial owner of shares held in a voting trust should also be permitted to serve as a plaintiff in a derivative suit. These changes were accomplished by the addition of a special
                        definition of "shareholder" in subsection (e) to broaden the definition of that term in section 1.40.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act and the statutes of many states have long imposed a "contemporaneous ownership" rule, i.e., the plaintiff must have been an owner of shares at the time of the transaction in question. This rule has been criticized as being unduly narrow
                        and technical and unnecessary to prevent the transfer or purchase of lawsuits. A few states, particularly California, Cal. G.C.L.
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 800(B), have relaxed this rule to the extent of allowing some subsequent purchasers of shares to be plaintiffs in limited circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decision to retain the contemporaneous ownership rule in section 7.40 was based primarily on the view that it was simple, clear, and easy to apply while the California approach might encourage litigation on peripheral issues like the extent of the
                        plaintiff's knowledge of the transaction in question when he acquired his shares. Further, there has been no persuasive showing that the contemporaneous ownership rule has prevented the litigation of substantial suits since there
                        appear to be many persons who might qualify as plaintiffs to bring suit even if subsequent purchasers are disqualified.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.40(b) requires the complaint in a derivative suit to be verified, i.e., sworn to. Compare FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, rule 23.1;
                        <i>
        Surowitz v. Hilton Hotels Corp.,
       </i> 383 U.S. 363 (1966). This requirement provides some protection against groundless litigation without deterring suits brought in good faith.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Arguments may be made that long-term creditors and investors with the privilege of becoming shareholders by the exercise of options or conversion rights should be permitted to bring derivative suits. These arguments, however, appear to involve the substantive
                        rights of these various classes of investors more than the procedures required for the assertion of derivative rights on behalf of the corporation. See, e.g.,
                        <i>
        Harff v. Kerkorian,
       </i> 324 A.2d 215 (Del. Ch. 1974), rev'd in part, 347 A.2d 133 (Del. 1975). Therefore, section 7.40(a) does not permit option holders or convertible debenture holders to serve as derivative plaintiffs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of a demand on the board of directors is to stimulate the board of directors to enforce the rights of the corporation on its own. Modern trends in corporate governance - particularly the increasing number of outside directors and greater directors
                        sensitivity to their roles in the corporation and to the possibility of personal liability - improve the likelihood that the board of directors will weigh carefully the shareholder's demand. Therefore, section 7.40(b) requires
                        an allegation with particularity of the demand made, if any, on the board of directors. On the other hand, there may be circumstances showing that a demand on the board of directors would be useless, and in those circumstances
                        it should be sufficient to allege the reasons why the plaintiff did not make the demand.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Of itself, the rejection by the board of directors of the shareholder's demand neither permits nor precludes the shareholder's suit. See paragraph 2a. below.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rule 23.1 of the FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE requires that, in addition to a demand on the board of directors, a demand be made on shareholders "if necessary." The statutes of a number of states, including California and New York, require demands
                        only on boards of directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although a demand on shareholders seems generally consistent with the broad doctrine of requiring exhaustion of all internal avenues of relief before commencement of suit, the board of directors, not the shareholders, is charged with governance of the
                        corporation, including the commencement and management of litigation. Further, to require a demand on shareholders would virtually require the plaintiff to engage in a preliminary proxy contest and, in the case of publicly held
                        corporations, would greatly increase the costs of filing all derivative suits, discouraging even legitimate cases.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For these reasons, it was concluded that the requirement of a demand on shareholders would add uncertainty, expense, and delay without commensurately improving the prospects of resolving the substantive issues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last sentence of section 7.40(b) provides that if the corporation undertakes an investigation, the court may stay the proceeding until the investigation of the charges made in the demand or complaint is completed. The purpose of this stay is to preserve
                        the right of the board of directors to consider whether or not to seek to enforce on its own the corporation's claim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states required a plaintiff to give security for reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, if his holdings of shares did not reach a specified size or value - five percent of the outstanding
                        shares or a value of $25,000 in the earlier version of the Model Act. This requirement has been deleted. The security for expenses requirement, to the extent it was based on the size or value of the plaintiff's holdings rather
                        than on the apparent good faith of his claim, was subject to criticism that it unreasonably discriminated against small shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basic policy question with respect to the requirement of a bond for small shareholders is how far to go in protecting the corporation and its officers and directors from suits. The choice is between making the right to sue widely available, without
                        obstacles except in obviously baseless cases, or imposing obstacles in the way of the small shareholder without imposing a similar obstacle in the way of the large shareholder. Moreover, no bond requirement exists for class actions,
                        antitrust cases, or individual actions for personal injury, all of which involve the corporation in substantial expense of defending against suit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several states have concluded on the basis of these considerations that the bond requirement for small plaintiffs should be repealed or not adopted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In lieu of the bond requirement, section 7.40(d) provides that on termination of a proceeding the court may require the complainant to pay the defendants' reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, if it finds that the proceeding "was commenced without
                        reasonable cause." This test is similar to but not identical with the test utilized in section 13.31, relating to dissenters' rights, where the standard for award of expenses and attorneys' fees is that dissenters "acted arbitrarily,
                        vexatiously or not in good faith" in demanding a judicial appraisal of their shares. The derivative action situation is sufficiently different from the dissenters' rights situation to justify a different and less onerous test for
                        imposing costs on the plaintiff. The test of section 7.40 that the action was brought without reasonable cause is appropriate to deter strike suits, on the one hand, and on the other hand to protect plaintiffs whose suits have
                        a reasonable foundation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.40(d) does not refer to the award of expenses, including attorneys' fees, to successful plaintiffs. The right of successful plaintiffs in derivative suits to this recovery is so universally recognized, both by statute and on the theory of a
                        recovery of a fund or benefit for the corporation, that specific reference was thought to be unnecessary. The intention is to preserve fully these nonstatutory rights of reimbursement. Therefore, no negative inference should be
                        drawn from section 7.40(d) as to the rights of plaintiffs to reimbursement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Abuses in the conduct of derivative litigation may occur on the part of defendants and their counsel as well as by plaintiffs and their counsel. Abuses may occur with respect to motions, pleadings, requests for discovery and resistance to discovery when
                        conducted either in bad faith or without good cause. Sanctions to deal with such conduct are not included in this Act because courts possess adequate power to impose appropriate sanctions under rules of civil procedure or the general
                        equity power of courts. See
                        <i>
        Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper,
       </i> 447 U.S. 752 (1980).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.40(c) follows the FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE, and the statutes of a number of states, including New York and Michigan, and requires that all proposed settlements and discontinuances must receive judicial approval. This requirement seems
                        a natural consequence of the proposition that a derivative suit is brought on behalf of the class of all shareholders and avoids many of the evils of the strike suit by preventing the individual shareholder-plaintiff from settling
                        privately with the defendants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 7.40(c) also requires notice to all affected shareholders if the court determines that the proposed settlement may substantially affect the interest of one or more classes of shareholders. Unlike the statutes of some states, however, section 7.40(c)
                        does not address the issue of which party should bear the cost of giving this notice. That is a matter left to the discretion of the court reviewing the proposed settlement.

                        Several issues relating to section 7.40 were reserved for future consideration because it was felt that further experience or experimentation was desirable before their resolution was encapsulated in model statutory language. The issues so reserved include

                        The case law concerning the power of the board of directors or of an independent committee of the board to bar a derivative suit without judicial review is in a state of flux. See, e.g.,

                        Courts are today scrutinizing plaintiffs' fees more closely than they have in the past. This trend should be encouraged, and it was therefore concluded that the subject was not appropriate for statutory language at the present time. It is believed that
                        the problem is more acute with respect to plaintiffs' fees recoverable under general principles of derivative litigation than it is under section 7.40(d).

        c. Should there be a maximum limit on an individual's liability?
       </i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The sums involved in claims of alleged wrongdoing by a corporation and its officers and directors are often extremely large when viewed in the light of the personal resources of even an affluent person. Claims for millions of dollars may create a high
                        leverage to settle, and the potential exposure to these claims is an undesirable deterrent to service on the board of directors, particularly by outside directors. The proposed Federal Securities Code imposes a limit on individual
                        liability resulting from certain violations of the Code and similar suggestions have also been made by others. On the other hand, where a director's or officer's conduct has proved to be wrongful and detrimental to the corporation,
                        he should clearly be required to disgorge the entire benefit, and it also may be appropriate to require him rather than the victimized corporation and shareholders to bear any other loss suffered.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since no state has yet adopted a limitation of liability provision, and there is no experience with these provisions, it was thought inappropriate at the present time to discard the principle of unlimited liability.

        NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The provisions of the Model Act relating to the procedures in derivative proceedings were omitted in their entirety. The provisions of former G.S. 55-55, with minor modifications, have become subsections (a), (b), (d), (e), and (f). The second sentence
                        of subsection (b) was added to permit the stay of any proceeding in the discretion of the court during pendency of an investigation by the corporation of the charges made in the demand or complaint.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (c) permits a recently developed procedure whereby two or more disinterested directors or other disinterested persons determine whether a corporation should pursue a particular legal right or remedy and report their findings to the court, which
                        may then determine whether or not the derivative proceedings should be continued.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (g), which had no equivalent under prior law, imposes additional conditions upon plaintiffs who bring derivative proceedings on behalf of public corporations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (h), which also had no equivalent under prior law, assures availability of the normal corporate attorney-client privilege in derivative proceedings.

                        No Standing to Bring Suit Without Beneficial Interest. - Plaintiff had no standing to bring suit challenging action of corporation where he failed to maintain his status as a holder of a beneficial interest in the stock of that corporation throughout

        Effect of Futility Doctrine.
       </b> - The futility doctrine does not allow a shareholder to bring a claim directly. Rather, it simply allows a shareholder to bring a derivative claim without first making demand upon corporate management. Thus, this doctrine
                        offered no support to plaintiff's attempt to recover directly for the breach of his fellow directors' fiduciary duty to corporation. Silverman v. Miller, 155 Bankr. 362 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1993).

                    <p>
                        Pledgee of corporate stock has a significant beneficial interest to have standing to sue the corporation derivatively for mismanagement, provided he maintains an equitable interest in the collateral.

                        Demand for Action by Directors as Prerequisite. - Former G.S. 55-55(b) codified the prior case law of this and other jurisdictions that in order for an individual as a shareholder to bring suit against the directors of a corporation for breach of their
                        duties to the corporation, he must show that he has exhausted his intracorporate remedies by making demand upon the board to do that which he seeks to have done. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite>                        77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the absence of circumstances indicating that such a step would be futile, a demand that the directors act is a prerequisite of a shareholder suing upon behalf of the corporation. Roney v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite>                        81, 356 S.E.2d 401 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Exhaustion of intracorporate remedies (that is, "demand") is a procedural prerequisite to the filing of a derivative action in this State. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Minutes of board of directors meeting introduced into evidence by plaintiff confirmed that plaintiff made a motion that the corporation retain counsel to investigate the usurpation of a commercial leasing deal, and that this motion died for lack of a
                        second. This action satisfied the demand requirement of this section, and any further demand would have been futile. Silverman v. Miller, 155 Bankr. 362 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1993).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An equitable exception to the demand requirement may be invoked when the directors who are in control of the corporation are the same ones (or under the control of the same ones) as were initially responsible for the breaches of duty alleged; in such
                        a case, the demand of a shareholder upon the directors to sue themselves or their principals would be futile and therefore is not required for the maintenance of the action. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite>                        77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979); Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Mere negligence of the directors in evaluation of a purchase or in relying upon the advice of accounting and investment experts does not excuse a shareholder from demanding action by the board of directors before suing to enforce a corporate right. Roney
                        v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 356 S.E.2d 401 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Pleading of Damages and Defenses Thereto. - The pleading of the damages is an issue which is central to the merits of a derivative action and was not an area in which the corporation had standing to assert a defense. Swenson v. Thibaut,
                        <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Business Judgment Rule. - The business judgment rule, stated simply, provides that when a corporation's decision not to assert a claim represents a good faith business judgment by its directors, a shareholder will not be permitted to substitute his judgment
                        for that of the company's management by asserting the claim in a derivative action. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed,
                        <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Business Judgment Defense Involves Question of Good Faith. - Where the business judgment question is presented to the court as a ground for dismissal, the sole issue for determination is whether the decision was made in good faith. Swenson v. Thibaut,
                        <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).

                    <p>
                        When Defense of "Business Judgment" Available to Corporation. - The defense of business judgment is not available to the corporation in a derivative action where a majority of its directors are implicated in the allegations of the suit, as it is a defense
                        on the merits which may properly be interposed only by the directors and management of the corporation, unless the corporation is a real defendant as to some meritorious issue in the suit. Swenson v. Thibaut,
                        <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recommendation of Special Litigation Committee. - To rely blindly on the report of a corporation-appointed special litigation committee is to abdicate the judicial duty to consider the interests of shareholders imposed by statute; this abdication is particularly
                        inappropriate in a case where shareholders allege serious breaches of fiduciary duties owed to them by the directors controlling the corporation. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>,
                        358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fact that a special litigation committee appointed by directors charged with self-dealing recommends that derivative action should not proceed, while carrying weight, is not binding upon the trial court; rather, the court must make a fair assessment
                        of the report of the special committee, along with all the other facts and circumstances in the case, in order to determine whether the defendants will be able to show that the transaction complained of was just and reasonable
                        to the corporation. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The burden is on the movant, usually the corporation on whose behalf the suit was initiated, to prove the independence, disinterestedness, and appropriate qualifications of the committee and that it conducted a reasonable investigation in good faith of
                        the matters alleged in the complaint. The committee is not entitled to a presumption of independence, disinterestedness, good faith, or reasonableness. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>,
                        398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Corporation as Defendant Where Interest Adverse to Plaintiff's. - In some situations, the corporation in whose interest the derivative action is purportedly brought will have interests adverse to those of the nominal plaintiffs bringing the action derivatively,
                        and will of necessity be more than a nominal defendant. Such situations would include an action to enjoin the performance of a contract by the corporation, to appoint a receiver, to interfere with a corporate reorganization, or
                        to interfere with internal management, where there is no allegation of fraud or bad faith. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal
                        dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Corporation's Right to Defend Generally. - A corporation is not powerless in all cases and in all circumstances to resist a derivative action. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978),

                        Individual and Derivative Action Available to Minority Shareholders in Closely Held Corporation. - Minority shareholders in a closely held corporation who allege wrongful conduct and corruption against the majority shareholders in the corporation may
                        bring an individual action against those shareholders, in addition to maintaining a derivative action on behalf of the corporation. Norman v. Nash Johnson &amp; Sons' Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite>                        390, 537 S.E.2d 248 (2000).

                        Burden of Proving Reasonableness of Transactions. - When a stockholder in a derivative action seeks to establish self-dealing on the part of a majority of the board, the burden should be upon those directors to establish that the transactions complained
                        of were just and reasonable to the corporation when entered into or approved. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Defenses Not on Merits Available to Corporation. - Certain defenses, such as matters of personal jurisdiction, venue and subject matter jurisdiction (which question may arise in the context of alleged existence of prior pending actions involving matters
                        identical to those complained of in the derivative suit) could be asserted by both the corporation and individual defendants where appropriate, as they are not defenses on the merits of the derivative claim. Swenson v. Thibaut,
                        <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 181, 254 S.E.2d 182, 254 S.E.2d 183 (1979).

                        Additionally, certain defenses which are properly asserted before trial on the merits of the derivative action are peculiar to the corporation alone, and may be properly raised only by the corporate nominal defendant who, for purposes of those matters,
                        ceases to be a nominal defendant and becomes an actual party defendant. These defenses would include the lack of standing of the plaintiffs to sue derivatively for reasons of insufficient representation of shareholders and a failure
                        on plaintiffs' part to make a demand upon the board of directors. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>,

                        Limits on Corporation's Right to Defend. - In an action brought by a minority shareholder derivatively in the name and right of a corporation, to enforce rights or to seek redress accruing to the corporation, that corporation will be deemed for purposes
                        of the litigation to be aligned as a party plaintiff (except to the extent that the corporation is an actual defendant as to an issue in the action) although for purposes of form it is designated as a nominal defendant. Accordingly,
                        the corporation may not defend itself against the derivative action on the merits and must limit its defenses, if any, to the pre-trial matters proper to it. Where a corporation seeks to extend its defenses beyond those areas in
                        which it may properly conduct them, dismissal will lie against it. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d 279 (1978), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 740</cite>,

                        When Order Not Void for Lack of Notice to Shareholders. - In an action challenging the appointment of operating receivers for a corporation, there was no merit to defendants' contention that the initial order of the trial court appointing the receivers
                        was void because certain shareholders were not given notice of the proceedings and were thereby denied their due process rights to notice prior to a court proceeding, the outcome of which would affect their property interests,
                        since there was no requirement in the statutes, either in the provisions governing the appointment of receivers or in the provisions governing derivative shareholder suits, that notice be given to persons who are not parties to
                        the action. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 247 (1981).

                        The statute sets forth two distinct standards for awarding attorneys' fees to successful litigants and taxing unsuccessful litigants with their opponents' attorney's fees. The court may award attorney's fees to a successful litigant who obtains a compromise
                        and settlement or judgment, and may also assess attorney's fees against an unsuccessful litigant in certain cases. Lowder ex rel. Doby v. Doby, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 340 S.E.2d 487,

                    <p>
                        When Fees May Be Awarded. - The statute does not impose a requirement to quantify the financial success of the derivative claim before fees may be awarded. The plaintiff need only succeed, in whole or in part, on behalf of the corporation. Lowder v. All
                        Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 346 S.E.2d 695 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Amount of Award. - The statute does not provide, directly or indirectly, that the award of fees and expenses cannot exceed the specific monetary recovery. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite>                        470, 346 S.E.2d 695 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Award Upheld. - The removal of a self-dealing, controlling director from office and the appointment of a permanent receiver to protect the corporation in question conferred a substantial benefit on the corporation, so as to justify an award of attorneys'
                        fees against the corporation. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 346 S.E.2d 695 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Merit Bonus Improperly Added to Award. - An award of a merit bonus added by the court to the attorneys' fees awarded, based on factors that were properly considered in the initial determination of the hourly rates and the number of hours reasonably expended,
                        was an abuse of discretion. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 346 S.E.2d 695 (1986).

                        The trial court, in its discretion, may charge plaintiffs with defendants' reasonable expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred in defense of the action. Lowder ex rel. Doby v. Doby, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite>                        501, 340 S.E.2d 487, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 732</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 388 (1986).

                        Plaintiffs' actions were brought without reasonable cause where both the federal bankruptcy court and state receivership court had previously, either in Chapter X reorganization proceeding or receivership proceeding, dealt with the merits of the allegations
                        made by plaintiffs in their five complaints, and the record was devoid of evidence to support any reasonable belief that there was a sound chance that plaintiffs' claims in the litigation might be sustained. Lowder ex rel. Doby
                        v. Doby, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 340 S.E.2d 487, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 732</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 388 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Calculation of Fees and Expenses. - Where plaintiff filed five lawsuits involving substantially overlapping contentions of law and fact, four of which were virtually identical and were linked together for purposes of appeal, plaintiffs, who created the
                        situation, could not complain that the fees and expenses apportioned by the trial court to each of these nominally separate proceedings were not calculated with precision. Lowder ex rel. Doby v. Doby,
                        <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 340 S.E.2d 487, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 732</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 388 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Judicial Review. - The plain language of the statute requires thorough judicial review of suits initiated by shareholders on behalf of a corporation. The court is directed to determine whether the interest of any shareholder will be substantially affected
                        by the discontinuance, dismissal, compromise, or settlement of a derivative suit. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although the statute does not specify what test the court must apply in making its determination, it would be difficult for the court to determine whether the interests of shareholders or creditors would be substantially affected by such discontinuance,
                        dismissal, compromise, or settlement without looking at the proposed action substantively; the court must of necessity evaluate the adequacy of materials prepared by the corporation which support the corporation's decision to settle
                        or dismiss a derivative suit, along with the plaintiff's forecast of evidence. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Court approval is required for disposition of all derivative suits, even where the directors are not charged with fraud or self-dealing, or where the plaintiff and the board agree to discontinue, dismiss, compromise, or settle the lawsuit. Alford v. Shaw,
                        <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Disposition Where Amount of Recovery Would Not Outweigh Detriment to Corporation. - If it appears likely that plaintiff could prevail on the merits, but that the amount of the recovery would not be sufficient to outweigh the detriment to the corporation,
                        the court may allow discontinuance, dismissal, compromise, or settlement. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 465</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 323 (1987).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        In exercising its own independent business judgment, the court must consider "such ethical, commercial, promotional, public relations and fiscal factors as may be involved in a given situation." Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>,
                        398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                        The corporation as the party seeking final disposition of the case under former G.S. 55-55(c) (see now this section) has the burden of going forward with evidence, on such items, and to show that continuing the action is more likely than not to be against
                        the interests of the corporation. Of course, the shareholders initiating the suit are also entitled to present evidence and arguments as to their contentions. Ultimately, however, while "the review contemplated does not lend itself
                        to any formula-like approach," it is for the court to decide whether the case begun in the superior court will continue. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                        Trial judge may allow discovery to enable him to assess the committee of decision-makers, the investigation made by the committee, the findings of the committee, and the recommendation of the committee. After hearing evidence on these matters, the trial
                        court is to determine the independence, disinterestedness, and good faith of the committee in making its investigation, in addition to the reasonableness of the bases relied upon by the committee in concluding and recommending
                        that the cause of action on behalf of the corporation be disposed of as recommended. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                        Plaintiffs were not required to pursue statutory dissenters' rights under former G.S. 55-113 (see now Art. 13 of ch. 55) to oppose merger during litigation in order to maintain standing. Subdivision (c) of former G.S. 55-113 would have deprived them of
                        all interest in defendant corporation. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Responsibility of Court When Party Challenges Recommendation of Corporation. - Since proceedings under former G.S. 55-55(c) (see now this section) are held before a trial judge sitting without a jury, when a party challenges the recommendation of the
                        corporation in whose name a lawsuit was initiated derivatively, it is the court's responsibility first, to require the party taking issue with the recommendation to outline his contentions so he may receive an appropriate response
                        from the other parties to the suit, and then secondly, to hear evidence on these contentions, in order to be able to determine whether the lawsuit is to be discontinued, dismissed, settled, or turned over to the plaintiff-shareholders
                        or the corporation for litigation. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                        There was no requirement of continuing share ownership in former G.S. 55-55 in order for an individual, who was a shareholder at the time of the transaction about which he was complaining and at the time the action was filed, to proceed with a derivative
                        action. Had the legislature intended to include such a requirement in the corporate statutes, it would have done so. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                        Section Does Not Contain Continuing Share Ownership Requirement. - This section, the new statute, while elaborating some of the procedures set forth in former G.S. 55-55, does not contain a continuing share ownership requirement. Alford v. Shaw,
                        <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                    <p>
                        No State Constitutional Right Exists to Trial by Jury of Factual Issues. - Although a litigant's right to have a jury try issues of fact concerning the merits of the action initiated by the filing of a derivative suit complaint is guaranteed by the Constitution
                        of North Carolina, the procedure required by former G.S. 55-55(c) (see now this section) did not exist before the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, and therefore no State constitutional right exists to a trial by jury of factual
                        issues that might arise during the course of the proceedings required under this statute. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                    <p>
                        A litigant has no right to the determination of factual issues by a jury during proceedings occurring pursuant to former G.S. 55-55(c) (see now this section). In this section of the statute, it is clear that the word "court" referred to the trial judge
                        and not to a jury. The remaining sentences of former G.S. 55-55(c) referred to discretionary decisions exercisable properly only by the trial judge; clearly the legislature did not intend that a jury be involved in the procedures
                        required under former G.S. 55-55(c). Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                        Judge May Need to Resolve Fact Issues to Determine Future of Case. - As the judicial official charged under former G.S. 55-55(c) (see now this section) with this authority, the trial judge may well have to resolve issues of fact to decide whether to permit
                        the suit to go forward, be settled, or be dismissed. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).

                        Trial Court's Review of Motions to Settle, Dismiss, Compromise or Discontinue. - The trial court is to undertake a two-step review of motions brought under former G.S. 55-55(c) (see now this section). First, it is to decide whether the proposal for disposition
                        of the case which is submitted to the court was reached by qualified independent disinterested decision-makers who in good faith proceeded to thoroughly investigate and evaluate the claims set forth in the complaint. The second
                        step requires the trial court to exercise its own independent business judgment as to whether the case is to be discontinued, dismissed, compromised or settled. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>,

                        Internal Affairs Doctrine. - In a suit between a lender and a broker, a prior New York decision was not overturned when the North Carolina court found that the lender breached fiduciary duties because: (1) collateral estoppel, res judicata, and full faith
                        and credit did not apply since the New York court did not dispose of or address the broker's counterclaims; and (2) the internal affairs doctrine was a conflict of laws principle, not a jurisdictional principal. Bluebird Corp.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.01 requires that every corporation have a board of directors except that a corporation with 50 or fewer shareholders may dispense with or limit the authority of the board of directors by describing in the articles "who will perform some or all
                        of the duties of a board of directors." Section 8.01(c). This election is independent of the various close corporation elections permitted by the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement, though the basic standard of 50 shareholders
                        is the same in both section 8.01 and that Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obviously, some form of governance is necessary for every corporation. The board of directors is the traditional form of corporate governance but it need not be the exclusive form. Patterns of management may be tailored to specific needs in connection
                        with family controlled enterprises, wholly or partially owned subsidiaries, or corporate joint ventures without the requirement of electing close corporation status under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement. The persons
                        who perform some or all of the duties of the board of directors may be designated "trustees," "agents," or "managers," and they may be selected in ways other than the traditional election by the shareholders. It is necessary, however,
                        that some person or group perform these duties, and the designated persons, while performing them, are subject to the same duties as directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An example of the restructuring of the traditional board of directors permitted by section 8.01 is presented by the facts of
                        <i>
        Lehrman v. Cohen,
       </i> 43 Del. Ch. 222, 222 A.2d 800 (Del. 1966), where two shareholders (or allied family interests) had equal voting power and wished to permit the corporation's attorney to cast a tie-breaking vote on the board of directors
                        without giving him a participating equity interest in the corporation. While the desired result was successfully achieved in that case by creating a class of voting shares without a significant economic interest in the corporation,
                        the same result may be reached under section 8.01 directly by provision in the articles of incorporation without creating a special class of shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Any arrangement under section 8.01(c) may also be established by a close corporation election under the Model Statutory Close Corporation Supplement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a corporation has more than 50 shareholders, it must adopt the traditional board of directors as its sole form of governance. Because questions may at least theoretically arise how joint share ownership and other arrangements should be counted in
                        applying a numerical limitation, section 1.42 prescribes rules for calculating the number of shareholders for the purpose of this and other numerical limitations in the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.01(b) states that if a corporation has a board of directors "all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the authority of, and the business and affairs of the corporation managed under the direction of," the board of directors. The quoted
                        language is chosen to reflect the role and functions of boards of directors in all varieties of corporations. In a small corporation and in some larger corporations where the board of directors is composed entirely of persons actively
                        involved in the management of the corporate business, it may be reasonable to describe management as being "by" the board of directors. But a different model is appropriate for the boards of directors of publicly held corporations,
                        which usually include individuals not actively involved in management. In these corporations it is not feasible to impose a requirement that the business and affairs of the corporation be managed "by" the board of directors. In
                        these corporations the appropriate model is that the business and affairs be managed "under the direction of" the board of directors, since the role of the board of directors consist principally of the formulation of major management
                        policy with little or no direct involvement in day-to-day management.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a correlative in large and complex publicly held corporations it is generally recognized that the board of directors may delegate to appropriate officers those powers not required by law to be exercised by the board of directors itself. Although delegation
                        does not relieve the board of directors from its responsibilities of oversight, directors should not be held personally responsible for actions or omissions of officers, employees, or agents of the corporation so long as the directors
                        have relied reasonably upon these officers, employees, or agents. See section 8.30 and its Official Comment. The board of directors has the power to probe to any depth its chooses in day-to-day management, but it has the responsibility
                        to do so only to the extent that section 8.30 requires.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.01(b) also recognizes that the powers of the board of directors may be limited by express provisions in the articles of incorporation.

                    <p>
                        This section contains several variations from former G.S. 55-24 and former G.S. 55-73. First, it requires that the board
                        <i>
    direct
   </i> the management of the business and affairs of the corporation whereas former G.S. 55-24 required that the board
                        <i>
    manage
   </i> the corporation's business and affairs. As pointed out in the Official Comment, the new language clarifies the role of directors as policy makers rather than managers. Also, this section clarifies that all shareholders
                        must assent to an agreement (not contained in the articles of incorporation) which limits or dispenses with the board; and it explicitly provides that those in whom the board's authority is vested under such an arrangement are
                        deemed to be acting as the board for all purposes of this Act (including the duties defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-30" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-30</a></cite> et seq.). Such substitutes for the board would be
                        subject to liability to the same extent as directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act in permitting limitation of the board's authority in a shareholders' agreement as well as in the articles of incorporation, and it permits dispensing with or limiting the board of a corporation regardless of the
                        number of shareholders. Any such arrangement accomplished through a shareholders' agreement must comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a07s55-7-31ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 55-7-31(b)</a></cite>. The
                        second clause of subsection (c) relating to rights of third parties without knowledge does not appear in the Model Act; it brings forward former G.S. 55-24(b). Finally, paragraph (d) does not appear in the Model Act, although it
                        is likely that the same result would be reached under the Model Act.

                        Former G.S. 55-33, which provided for jurisdiction over nonresident directors, was not brought forward because <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIIAa6As1-75.4" target="_blank">G.S. 1-75.4</a></cite>, the

                        Director occupies a fiduciary relation to the company which, by virtue of his office, he represents in the management of its principal functions. Hill v. Pioneer Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 173</cite>, 18 S.E. 107

                        Liability for Gross Mismanagement and Neglect. - Good faith alone will not relieve the directors of a corporation from liability to its creditors for damages caused them by their gross mismanagement and neglect of its affairs. Anthony v. Jeffress,

                        Duty of Care. - Directors are not, as a rule, responsible for mere errors of judgment, nor for slight omissions from which the loss complained of could not have been reasonably expected; but where they accept these positions of trust they are expected
                        and required to give them the care and attention that a prudent man should exercise in like circumstances, and are charged with a like duty, usually the care that a prudent man shows in the conduct of his own affairs of a similar
                        kind. Besseliew v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 65</cite>, 97 S.E. 743 (1919).

                        Same Good Faith Required of Promoters as Directors. - The promoters of a corporation occupy a relation of trust and confidence towards the corporation which they are calling into existence as well as to each other, and the law requires of them the same
                        good faith it exacts from directors and other fiduciaries. Wilson v. McClenny, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 121</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 569 (1964).

                        Right of Corporation to Sue Negligent Directors. - Where the directors or managing officers of a corporation are liable in damages for their willful or negligent failure to exercise the care and attention to corporate affairs entrusted to them and which
                        they have assumed, an action will lie against them in favor of the corporation, and in case of its insolvency and receivership, in favor of its receiver. Besseliew v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 65</cite>,

                        Powers to Borrow Money and Encumber Property. - The directors of a corporation, unless they are specially restrained by the charter or bylaws, have the power to borrow money with which to conduct its business and to secure payment by mortgage on corporate
                        property. Wall v. Rothrock, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 388</cite>, 88 S.E. 633 (1916).

                        Director of a company may lend it money when needed for its benefit, and take a lien upon the corporate property as security for its repayment, provided the transaction is open and entirely fair and capable of strict proof as to its bona fides. Hill v.

                        Right of Directors to Security. - By taking a mortgage on corporate property when the corporation is in failing circumstances, directors, occupying a fiduciary relation, are not permitted to secure themselves against preexisting liabilities of the corporation
                        upon which they are already bound. Wall v. Rothrock, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 388</cite>, 88 S.E. 633 (1916); Caldwell v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 518</cite>, 103 S.E. 75 (1920).

                    <p>
                        Judgment Liens of Directors. - Where the directors of a corporation made a bona fide sale of property to it, for value and free from fraud, judgments against the corporation for the purchase price, duly docketed, constitute liens in favor of the directors
                        against the corporate property. Caldwell v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 518</cite>, 103 S.E. 75 (1920).

                    <p>
                        Use of Inside Information by Director to Gain Advantage Against Other Creditors. - Where a corporation is insolvent, a director who is a creditor cannot, upon a debt theretofore existing, take advantage of his superior means of information to secure his
                        debt as against other creditors. Hill v. Pioneer Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 173</cite>, 18 S.E. 107 (1893).

                    <p>
                        Stockholder's Agreements on Election of Directors Are Valid Absent Fraud or Prejudice. - North Carolina is aligned with the majority of jurisdictions which hold that a contract entered into between corporate stockholders by which they agree to vote their
                        stock in a specified manner - including agreements for the election of directors and corporate officers - is not invalid unless it is inspired by fraud or will prejudice the other stockholders. Wilson v. McClenny,
                        <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 121</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 569 (1964).

                        other stockholders, or are made in consideration of a private benefit to the promisor will be declared invalid. Wilson v. McClenny, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 121</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 569 (1964).

                    <p>
                        The elimination of mandatory special qualifications for directors is now nearly universal. The articles of incorporation or bylaws, however, may prescribe special qualifications, an option that is most likely to be utilized in closely held corporations
                        where qualifications for directors may be used as a device for ensuring representation and voting power on the board of directors.

                        Section 8.03 prescribes rules for the determination of the size of the board of directors of corporations that have not dispensed with a board of directors under section 8.01(c), and for changes in the size of the board of directors once it is established.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.03(a) provides that the size of the initial board of directors may be "specified in or fixed in accordance with" the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The size of the board of directors may thus be fixed initially in the fundamental corporate
                        documents, or the decision as to the size of the initial board of directors may be made thereafter by those authorized in those documents. After shares have been issued, however, the power to increase or decrease the size of the
                        board of directors by more than 30 percent, whether by amendment of the bylaws or otherwise, is reserved to the shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before 1969 the Model Act required a board of directors to consist of at least three directors. Since then, however, the Model Act, and the corporation statutes of an increasing number of states, have provided that the board of directors may consist of
                        one or more members. A board of directors consisting of one or more individuals may be appropriate for corporations with one or two shareholders, or for corporations with more than two shareholders where in fact the full power
                        of management is vested in only one or two persons. The requirement that every corporation have a board of directors of at least three directors may require the introduction into these closely held corporations of persons with
                        no financial interest in the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.03(b) and (c) prescribe rules for corporations in which the board of directors has authority to establish or change the size of the board of directors. It has no application to corporations in which the size of the board of directors is fixed
                        by the bylaws and the shareholders reserve to themselves the power to amend bylaws. See section 10.20. The basic premise is that the determination of the size of the board of directors should rest with the shareholders. These subsections
                        also prevent the board of directors from manipulating its own size without the approval of the shareholders. But experience has shown, particularly in larger corporations, that it is desirable to grant the board of directors some
                        authority to change its size without incurring the expense of obtaining shareholder approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (b) therefore permits the board of directors to increase or decrease its own size by up to 30 percent without shareholder approval. The 30 percent is calculated from the size last approved by the shareholders, thereby preventing directors from
                        tacking a series of 30 percent increases or decreases to alter the basic composition of a board of directors without shareholder approval. For example, in a board of directors fixed or approved by the shareholders at 15 members,
                        the board may, without shareholder approval, change the size of the board to as few as 11 or as many as 19; a board of 5 may be changed by the board to as few as 4 or as many as 6. The 30-percent limit was established to give the
                        board of directors reasonable leeway in adjusting its own size. Thus, when a director resigns, the board of directors should normally be able to reduce its own size and elect not to fill the vacancy without shareholder action;
                        similarly, if an exceptionally qualified person becomes available (or is invited to serve on the board of directors because of a felt need), he may normally be added to the board of directors without shareholder approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, subsection (c) authorizes the articles of incorporation or bylaws to establish a variable-range size for the board of directors. If a variable range size is established, either the shareholders or the board of directors may prescribe or
                        change the size of the board of directors within that range. However, only the shareholders may amend the bylaws to change the limits established for the size of the board of directors, or to change from a variable-range size board
                        to a fixed board or vice versa. A variable-range size board is intended to provide essentially the same benefits as the authority granted a board of directors by subsection (b) to change its own size by 30 percent. Many publicly
                        held corporations have established variable-range size boards of directors pursuant to general authority in state statutes. Specific recognition and regulation of this widespread practice seems desirable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.03(c) also applies to a variable-range size board of directors whose initial size is established by the articles of incorporation if the articles authorize changing the limits of the size of the board without having to amend the articles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The limitations on the authority of the board of directors set forth in this section are substantive restrictions that may not be changed by provisions in articles of incorporation or bylaws. For example, a general provision in bylaws granting the board
                        of directors authority to amend bylaws does not authorize a board of directors, after shares are issued, to change the limits of a variable-range board established by the bylaws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 8.03(b) and (c) are primarily designed for publicly held corporations. In closely held corporations, typically, a change in the size of the board of directors may be accomplished readily by the shareholders if that is desired. In many closely
                        held corporations, on the other hand, a board of directors of a fixed size may be an essential part of a control arrangement. In these situations, an increase or decrease in the size of the board of directors by even a single member
                        may significantly affect control. In order to effectuate control arrangements dependent on a board of directors of a fixed size, the power of the board of directors to change its own size must be negated. This may be accomplished
                        by fixing the size of the board of directors in the articles of incorporation or by expressly negating all powers of the board of directors to change the size of the board, whether by amendment of the bylaws or otherwise. See section
                        10.22.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.03(d) makes it clear that all directors are elected annually unless the board is staggered. See section 8.05 and its Official Comment.

                        This section permits any corporation to have fewer than three directors, whereas former G.S. 55-25(a) permitted it only where there were fewer than three shareholders. In addition, unless there is cumulative voting, this section permits the board to change
                        the number of directors by up to 30% in a 12-month period, whereas former G.S. 55-25(b) required shareholder action or a provision in the articles of incorporation to change the number of directors except within a variable range.
                        Finally, this section eliminates the provision in former G.S. 55-25(e) which allowed a shareholder to demand election by ballot unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provided otherwise.

                        Section 8.04 makes explicit that the articles of incorporation may provide that a specified number (or all) of the directors may be elected by the holders of one or more classes of shares. This approach is widely used in closely held corporations to effect
                        an agreed upon allocation of control, for example, to ensure minority representation on the board of directors by issuing to that minority a class of shares entitled to elect one or more directors. A class (or classes) of shares
                        entitled to elect separately one or more directors constitutes a separate voting group for purposes of the election of directors; within each voting group directors are elected by a plurality of votes and quorum and voting requirements
                        must be separately met by each voting group. See sections 7.25, 7.26, and 7.28.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.05(d) provides that the terms of all directors elected to fill vacancies expire at the next meeting of shareholders at which directors are elected. Thus, if terms are staggered under section 8.06, the term of a director elected to fill a vacant
                        term with more than a year to run is shorter than the term of his predecessor. The board of directors may take appropriate steps, by designation of short terms or otherwise, to return the rotation of election of directors to the
                        original terms established or fixed by the articles or bylaws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.05(e) provides for "holdover" directors so that directorships do not automatically become vacant at the expiration of their terms but the same persons continue in office until successors qualify for office. Thus the power of the board of directors
                        to act continues uninterrupted even though an annual shareholders' meeting is not held or the shareholders are deadlocked and unable to elect directors at the meeting.

                    The articles of incorporation or bylaws adopted by the shareholders may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two, three, or four groups, with each group containing one-half, one-third, or one-fourth
                    of the total, as near as may be. In that event, the terms of directors in the first group expire at the first annual shareholders' meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second annual shareholders'
                    meeting after their election, the terms of the third group, if any, expire at the third annual shareholders' meeting after their election, and the terms of the fourth group, if any, expire at the fourth annual shareholders' meeting
                    after their election. At each annual shareholders' meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a term of two, three, or four years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.06 recognizes the practice of "classifying" the board or "staggering" the terms of directors so that only one-half or one-third of them are elected at each annual shareholders' meeting and directors are elected for two- or three-year terms rather
                        than one-year terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 8.06 at least three directors must be elected at each annual meeting. These directors may be elected by one or more voting groups, as provided in the articles of incorporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The principal justification for staggering the board today is that it protects against sudden change in the management of the corporation despite a change in shareholdings. It also reduces the impact of cumulative voting since a greater number of votes
                        is required to elect a director if the board is staggered than is required if the entire board were elected at each annual meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The staggered board of directors is sometimes used by incumbent management to make unwanted takeover attempts more difficult to effectuate. It is unlikely to be effective alone, however, since the shareholders may in any event remove directors under section
                        8.08 whether or not their terms are staggered. As a result, a staggered board is likely to be used for this purpose only in conjunction with a provision that directors may be removed only for cause.

                        The resignation of a director is effective when the written notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective date, in which case the director continues to serve until that later date. Since the person giving the notice is still a member

                        Section 8.08(a) accepts the view that since the shareholders are the owners of the corporation, they should normally have the power to change the directors at will. This section reverses the common law position that directors have a statutory entitlement
                        to their office and can be removed only for cause - fraud, criminal conduct, gross abuse of office amounting to a breach of trust, or similar conduct. The power to remove directors is subject to several restrictions set forth in
                        section 8.08:

                            The power to remove a director without cause may be eliminated by a provision in the articles of incorporation. Such a provision in effect guarantees the directors the same entitlement to office that directors enjoyed at common law. It is likely to be
                            used in closely held corporations as an element of an agreed-upon allocation of power and control which ensures directors immunity from removal except for cause. It may also be used in publicly held corporations that fear changes
                            in ownership of the majority of the shares and desire to provide security to the directors.

                            If the articles of incorporation provide that one or more classes of shares constitute a separate voting group entitled to elect a director (see section 8.04), only the shareholders of that voting group may participate in the vote whether or not to remove
                            that director. But that director may be removed by court proceeding under section 8.09 despite this section.

                            his election is present.

                            If cumulative voting is authorized, a different standard for removal is involved. Under cumulative voting, a director may be removed (with or without cause) only if the votes cast in favor of retaining him would not have been sufficient to elect him pursuant
                            to cumulative voting at that meeting. This provision guarantees that a minority faction with sufficient votes to guarantee the election of a director under cumulative voting will be able to protect that director from removal
                            by the remaining shareholders. The director, however, may be removed by court proceeding under section 8.09 despite this section. In computing whether or not a director elected by cumulative voting is protected from removal
                            from office by section 8.08(c), the votes should be counted as though (1) the vote to remove the director occurred in an election to elect the number of directors normally elected by the voting group along with the director
                            whose removal is sought, (2) the number of votes cast cumulatively against removal of the director had been cast for his election, and (3) all votes cast for removal of the director had been cast cumulatively in an efficient
                            pattern for the election of a sufficient number of candidates so as to deprive the director whose removal is being sought of his office.

                        Section 8.09 authorizes the removal of a director who is found in a judicial proceeding to have engaged in fraudulent or dishonest conduct or gross abuse of office. For example, a judicial proceeding (as contrasted with removal under section 8.08) may
                        be necessary or appropriate in the following situations:

                            In a closely held corporation, the director charged with misconduct is elected by voting group or cumulative voting, and the shareholders with power to prevent his removal exercise that power despite the existence of fraudulent or dishonest conduct. The
                            classic example is where the director charged with misconduct himself possesses sufficient votes to prevent his own removal and exercises his voting power to that end.

                            In a publicly held corporation, the director charged with misconduct declines to resign, though urged to do so, and because of the large number of widely scattered shareholders, a special shareholders' meeting can be held only after a period of delay
                            and at considerable expense.

                        10 percent of the outstanding shares of the corporation may maintain suit in his own name and in his own right without compliance with section 7.40. The corporation, however, must be made a party to the proceeding. See section

                        The purpose of section 8.09 is to permit the prompt and efficient elimination of dishonest directors. It is not intended to permit judicial resolution of internal corporate struggles for control except in those cases in which a court finds that the director
                        has been guilty of wrongful conduct of the type described.

                        Vacancies on the board of directors may be filled either by the shareholders or by the board of directors. In large corporations the cost of calling a special meeting of shareholders may be prohibitive so that in those corporations filling vacancies by
                        the board of directors is the norm. On the other hand, in a closely held corporation the shareholders may fill vacancies as readily as the board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.10(a)(3) allows the directors remaining in office to fill vacancies even though they are fewer than a quorum. The test for the exercise of this power is whether the directors remaining in office are fewer than a quorum, not whether the directors
                        seeking to act are fewer than a quorum. For example, on a board of six directors where a quorum is four, if there are two vacancies, they may not be filled under section 8.10(a)(3) at a "meeting" attended by only three directors.
                        Even though the three directors are fewer than a quorum, section 8.10(a)(3) is not applicable because the number of directors remaining in office - four - is not fewer than a quorum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.10(b) provides that if a voting group of shares is entitled to elect a director, only that voting group is entitled to fill a vacant office which was held by a director elected by that voting group. This section is part of the consistent treatment
                        of directors elected by a voting group of shareholders. See sections 1.40, 7.25, 7.26, 7.28, 8.04 and 8.08(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.10(c) permits vacancies that will arise on a specific later date to be filled in advance of that date so long as the designee does not actually take office until the vacancy occurs. The director in the office that will become vacant may participate
                        in the selection of his successor. A vacancy arising at a later date is most likely to arise because of a resignation effective at a later date; it may also arise in connection with retirements or with prospective amendments to
                        bylaws. In a closely held corporation with a balance of power on the board of directors that was reached by agreement, a prospective resignation followed by the appointment of a successor under this section permits the board to
                        act on the replacement before the change in balance caused by the resignation.

                        This section is generally consistent with prior law. However, unlike the present section, former G.S. 55-27(c) permitted the bylaws as well as the articles of incorporation to withhold from directors the power to fill board vacancies and did not permit
                        the directors to fill vacancies created by an increase in the authorized number of directors, except within a minimum-maximum range fixed by the shareholders.

                    <p>
                        This section expands the comparable Model Act section in subsection (a) by explicitly recognizing a vacancy occurring from failure by the shareholders to elect a full board and in subsection (b) by permitting the remaining directors elected by a voting
                        group to fill a vacancy in that class of directors, both of which are consistent with former G.S. 55-27(c). The Model Act was modified in subsection (c) to conform to the changes made in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-07ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-07(b)</a></cite>                        regarding the effective date of a resignation.

                    <p>
                        This section puts at rest the question whether the board of directors can fix the compensation of its members for serving as directors. The practice of compensating directors is now of long standing, and the establishment of a policy with respect to director
                        compensation is an appropriate function of the board of directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In publicly held corporations, compensation is customarily provided to nonmanagement directors. As stated in
                        <i>
        The Corporate Director's Guidebook,
       </i> ". . . it is expected that a nonmanagement director will devote substantial attention to the affairs of the corporation and will be compensated accordingly." 33 BUS. LAW. 1591, 1622 (1978).

                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act by confirming that, in the case of a public corporation or of a private corporation that so provides in its articles of incorporation, if the board of directors fixes the compensation of directors, then regardless
                        of their personal interest in that decision, the amount of compensation is presumed fair to the corporation and the challenger would be required to allege facts, that if proven true, would be sufficient to overcome the presumption
                        in order to avoid dismissal at the summary judgment stage of any proceeding. In effect, the section confirms that the decision of a board regarding its compensation is subject to review under the business judgment rule, but the
                        amendment does not preclude meritorious challenges where a board of directors has awarded itself compensation that is proven not to be fair to the corporation.

                        This section authorizes meetings of directors anywhere. No distinction is made between meetings in-state and out-of-state. It also authorizes the board of directors to permit any or all directors to participate in a meeting by the use of any means of
                        communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other. This decision is discretionary with the board of directors, and a person participating in this fashion is deemed to be present in person at
                        the meeting for purposes of quorum and voting requirements.

                        With the development of modern electronic technology, it is possible that the advantages of the traditional meeting, at which all members are present at a single place, may be obtained even though the members are physically dispersed and no two directors
                        are present at the same place. The advantage of the traditional meeting is the opportunity for interchange that is permitted by a meeting in a single room at which members are physically present. If this opportunity for interchange
                        is thought to be available by the board of directors, a meeting may be conducted by electronic means although no two directors are physically present at the same place and no specific place for the meeting is designated.

                        By providing that, in the absence of contrary provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, "the board of directors may permit" telephonic participation in its meetings, this section resolves the ambiguity of former G.S. 55-29(c), which provided
                        that a director "may participate" telephonically in such meetings. It is now clear that an individual director may not assert telephonic participation as a right.

                        The power of the board of directors to act unanimously without a meeting is based on the pragmatic consideration that in many situations a formal meeting is a waste of time. For example, in a closely held corporation there will often be informal discussion
                        by the manager-owners of the venture before a decision is made. And, of course, if there is only a single director (as is permitted by section 8.03), a written consent is the natural method of signifying director action. Consent
                        may be signified on one or more documents if desirable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In publicly held corporations, formal meetings of the board of directors may be appropriate for many actions. But there will always be situations where prompt action is necessary and the decision noncontroversial, so that approval without a formal meeting
                        may be appropriate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 8.21 the requirement of unanimous consent precludes the possibility of stifling or ignoring opposing argument. A director opposed to an action that is proposed to be taken by unanimous consent, or uncertain about the desirability of that
                        action, may compel the holding of a directors' meeting to discuss the matter simply by withholding his consent.

                        Regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice and special meetings require only two days' notice unless other requirements are imposed by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. The notice may be written or oral. Also, no statement
                        of the purpose of either a regular or special meeting is necessary unless required by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. These requirements differ from the requirements applicable to meetings of shareholders because of fundamental
                        differences in their roles: directors are expected to be more closely involved in corporate affairs than shareholders, and meetings of directors are held more systematically and regularly than meetings of shareholders.

                        Section 8.23(a) reverses the common law rule that invalidates waivers of notice by directors after the date and time of the meeting. In modern practice notice is often a technical requirement and waivers should be freely permitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.23(b) recognizes that the function of notice is to inform directors of a meeting. If a director actually appears at the meeting he has probably had notice of it and generally should not be able to raise a technical objection that he was not
                        given notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In cases where actual prejudice occurs because of the lack of notice, as may be indicated by the absence of one or more other directors, the director must call attention to the defect at the outset of the meeting or promptly upon his arrival. That director,
                        or a director who did not receive notice and was not present at the meeting, may then attack the validity of the action taken for want of notice. If a director properly objects to the meeting being held, he is not presumed to have
                        assented to actions taken thereafter, but he waives his objection if he there after votes for or assents to action taken at the meeting. See section 8.24(d).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT, =nl 2016 REVISION
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        In the absence of a provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a quorum is a majority of the total number of directors specified (
                        <i>
        e.g.,
       </i> "the number of directors shall be X") in or fixed (
                        <i>
        e.g.,
       </i> "the number of directors shall be not less than Y or more than Z as determined by the board of directors") in accordance with the articles of incorporation or the bylaws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.24(a) recognizes that the Act itself may provide for a different quorum in certain specified situations. See sections 8.53(c)(1) and 8.55(b)(1).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.24 allows the articles of incorporation or bylaws to decrease the required quorum (but not below one-third) or to increase the quorum or the vote necessary to take action up to and including unanimity. The articles of incorporation or bylaws
                        may also establish quorum or voting requirements with respect to directors elected by voting groups of shareholders pursuant to section 8.04. The options to increase the quorum and vote requirements might be used, for example,
                        in closely held corporations where a greater degree of participation is thought appropriate or where a minority participant in the venture seeks to obtain a veto power over corporate action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The phrase "when the vote is taken" in section 8.24(c) is designed to make clear that the board of directors may act only when a quorum is present. If directors leave during the course of a meeting, the board of directors may not act after the number
                        of directors present is reduced to less than a quorum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a director who is present at a meeting wishes to object or abstain with respect to action taken by the board of directors or a committee, that director must make his or her position clear in one of the ways described in section 8.24(d). If objection
                        is made in the form of a written dissent under clause (iii) of section 8.24(d), it may be transmitted by any form of delivery authorized by the definition of that term in section 1.40, including electronic transmission, if authorized
                        by section 1.41. Section 8.24(d) serves the important purpose of bringing the position of the dissenting director clearly to the attention of the other directors. The provision that a director who is present is deemed to have assented
                        unless an objection is noted also prevents a director from later seeking to avoid responsibility because of unexpressed doubts about the wisdom of the action taken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.24(d) applies only to directors who are present at the meeting. Directors who are not present are not deemed to have assented to any action taken at the meeting in their absence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This section is generally consistent with prior law but clarifies an ambiguity in former G.S. 55-28(d) by expressly requiring in subsection (c) that a quorum be present when the vote is taken, thus explicitly permitting directors to prevent further action
                        by withdrawing from the meeting to eliminate a quorum.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section varies from the Model Act in requiring in subsection (b) that a bylaw fixing a low quorum be "adopted by the shareholders." For clarification, the word "files" was substituted in subdivision (d) (3) for the Model Act's ambiguous "delivers."

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    <p>
                        Section 8.25 makes explicit the common law power of a board of directors to act through committees of directors and specifies the powers of the board of directors that are nondelegable, that is, powers that only the full board of directors may exercise.
                        Section 8.25 deals only with committees of the board of directors exercising the functions of the board of directors; the board of directors or management, independently of section 8.25, may establish nonboard committees composed
                        of directors, employees, or others to deal with corporate powers not required to be exercised by the board of directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.25(b) provides that a committee of the board of directors may be created only by the affirmative vote of a majority of the board of directors then in office, or, if greater, by the number of directors required to take action by the articles
                        of incorporation or the bylaws. This supermajority requirement reflects the importance of the decision to invest board committees with power to act under section 8.25.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Committees of the board of directors are assuming increasingly important roles in the governance of publicly held corporations. See "The Corporate Director's Guidebook," 33 BUS. LAW. 1591 (1978); "The Overview Committees of the Board of Directors," 35
                        BUS. LAW. 1335 (1980). Executive committees have long provided guidance to management between meetings of the full board of directors. Audit committees also have a long history of performing essential review and control functions
                        on behalf of the board of directors. In recent years nominating and compensation committees, composed primarily or entirely of nonmanagement directors, have also become more widely used by publicly held corporations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.25 establishes the desirable and appropriate role of director committees in light of competing considerations: on the one hand, it seems clear that appropriate board committee action is not only desirable but also is likely to improve the functioning
                        of larger and more diffuse boards of directors; on the other hand, wholesale delegation of authority to a board committee, to the point of abdication of director responsibility as a board of directors, is manifestly inappropriate
                        and undesirable. Overbroad delegation also increase the potential, where the board of directors is divided, for usurpation of basic board functions by means of delegation to a committee dominated by one faction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statement of nondelegable functions set out in section 8.25(e) is based on the principle that prohibitions against delegation should be limited generally to actions substantially affecting the rights of shareholders among themselves as shareholders
                        and specifically to (1) those matters that have immediate and irrevocable effect (such as the declaration of a dividend), (2) those matters that may well become irrevocable without swift action, and (3) those matters that will
                        cause changes of position by others that cannot be rectified. As a result, delegation of authority to committees under section 8.25(e) may be broader than mere authority to act with respect to matters arising within the ordinary
                        course of business. The ordinary course of business standard for delegation was rejected as being too narrow and inappropriate for many modern corporations. For example, although section 8.25(e)(8) makes nondelegable the decision
                        whether to issue and sell shares or create a class or series of shares with designated rights and preferences, it permits the board of directors to delegate to a committee (within limits specifically prescribed by the board of
                        directors) the important but more limited functions of fixing the specific terms - including without limitation, the price, the dividend rate, provisions for redemption, sinking fund, conversion, voting or preferential rights,
                        and provisions for other features of a class or series of shares. The committee may also be empowered to adopt any final resolution setting forth the terms and to authorize the appropriate filing with the Secretary of State required
                        by this Act. Thus, terms of the sale of shares may be set quickly and upon the most accurate information without necessarily involving a meeting of the board of directors. The phrase "(or senior executive officer of the corporation)"
                        also permits these functions to be delegated to the chief financial officer or other appropriate officer of the corporation. The subsection also permits delegation to a committee of authority to determine the terms of a contract
                        or option for the sale of shares if the board prescribes specific limits in a stock option plan or otherwise. This delegation avoids requiring involvement of the full board in the details of the administration of stock option or
                        other compensation plans.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.25(e) prohibits delegation of authority with respect to most mergers, sales of substantially all the assets, amendments to articles of incorporation and voluntary dissolution under section 8.25(e)(2) since these require shareholder action. In
                        addition, section 8.25(e) prohibits delegation to a board committee of authority to declare dividends or distributions, designate director candidates for purposes of proxy solicitation, fill board vacancies, approve a so-called
                        "short-form merger" (where the interests of the minority shareholders warrant special attention), authorize the disposition or reacquisition of shares, or amend the bylaws or the articles of incorporation (without shareholder approval
                        under section 10.02). On the other hand, under section 8.25(e) many actions of a material nature, such as the authorization of long-term debt and capital investment or the pricing of shares, may properly be made the subject of
                        committee delegation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutes of several states make nondelegable certain powers not listed in section 8.25(e) - for example, the power to change the principal corporate office, to appoint or remove officers, to fix director compensation, or to remove agents. These are
                        not prohibited by section 8.25(e) since the whole board of directors may reverse or rescind the committee action taken, if it should wish to do so, without undue risk that implementation of the committee action might be irrevocable
                        or irreversible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.25(f) makes clear that although the board of directors may delegate to a committee the authority to take action, the designation of the committee, the delegation of authority to it, and action by the committee will not alone constitute compliance
                        by a noncommittee board member with his responsibility under section 8.30. On the other hand, a noncommittee director also will not automatically incur liability should the action of the particular committee fail to meet the standard
                        of care set out in section 8.30. The noncommittee member's liability in these cases will depend upon whether he failed to comply with section 8.30(b)(3). Factors to be considered in this regard will include the care used in the
                        delegation to and supervision over the committee, and the amount of knowledge regarding the particular matter which the noncommittee director has available to him. Care in delegation and supervision include appraisal of the capabilities
                        and diligence of the committee directors in light of the subject and its relative importance and may be facilitated, in the usual case, by review of minutes and receipt of other reports concerning committee activities. The enumeration
                        of these factors is intended to emphasize that directors may not abdicate their responsibilities and secure exoneration from liability simply by delegating authority to board committees. Rather, a director against whom liability
                        is asserted based upon acts of a committee of which he is not a member avoids liability if the standards contained in section 8.30 are met.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.25(f) has no application to a member of the committee itself. The standard applicable to a committee member is set forth in section 8.30(a).

                        The amendment to subsection (e)(1) affected by Session Law 2007-385 permits a board of directors to delegate to a committee the authority to authorize or approve distributions, but only according to a formula or method, or within limits, prescribed by
                        the board of directors. This applies to distributions as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a01s55-1-40" target="_self">G.S. 55-1-40</a></cite>, including but not limited to share reacquisitions
                        and dividends.

                        Subsection (a) provides that a board of directors may create committees and appoint one or more members of the board of directors to serve on the committees, but does not address the use of substitute committee members. The change in subsection (h), which
                        is based on Model Act (2016 Revision) Section 8.25(e), empowers board committees to continue operating despite a member's absence or disqualification by allowing the full board to designate another board member who would be available
                        to act without delay in committee meetings if a regular committee member was disqualified or unable to be present at a committee meeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless otherwise required by committee governing documents, replacement of an absent or disqualified member is not necessary to permit the other committee members to continue to perform their duties (provided that a quorum is present). Rather, appointing
                        alternate committee members in advance is intended as an expedient temporary solution, allowing a committee to continue effectively accomplishing its duties despite an absent or disqualified committee member and without necessity
                        of convening a special meeting of the full board to make a short-fuse replacement. The alternate director owes the same fiduciary duties and is subject to the same liabilities as any other director.

                        Section 8.26 is intended to clarify that a corporation can enter into an agreement, such as a merger agreement, containing a force the vote provision. Section 8.26 is broader than some analogous state corporation law provisions and applies to several
                        different provisions of the Model Act that require the directors to approve a matter before recommending that the shareholders vote to approve it. Under section 8.26, directors can agree to submit a matter to the shareholders for
                        approval even if they later determine that they no longer recommend it. The provision is not intended to relieve the board of directors of its duty to consider carefully the proposed transaction and the interests of the shareholders.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.30 defines the general standard of conduct for directors. It sets forth the standard by focusing on the manner in which the director performs his duties, not the correctness of his decisions. Section 8.30(a) thus requires a director to perform
                        his duties in good faith, with the care of an ordinarily prudent person in a like position and in a manner he believes to be in the best interests of the corporation. This standard is based on former section 35 of the 1969 Model
                        Act, a number of state statutes and on judicial formulations of the duty of care applicable to directors. Section 8.30 also parallels, to the extent possible, the indemnification provisions of sections 8.50 through 8.58.

                    <p>
                        In determining whether to impose liability, the courts recognize that boards of directors and corporate managers continuously make decisions that involve the balancing of risks and benefits for the enterprise. Although some decisions turn out to be unwise
                        or the result of a mistake of judgment, it is unreasonable to reexamine these decisions with the benefit of hindsight. Therefore, a director is not liable for injury or damage caused by his decision, no matter how unwise or mistaken
                        it may turn out to be, if in performing his duties he met the requirements of section 8.30.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even before statutory formulations of directors' duty of care, courts sometimes invoked the business judgment rule in determining whether to impose liability in a particular case. In doing so, courts have sometimes used language similar to the standards
                        set forth in section 8.30(a). The elements of the business judgment rule and the circumstances for its application are continuing to be developed by the courts. In view of that continuing judicial development, section 8.30 does
                        not try to codify the business judgment rule or to delineate the differences, if any, between that rule and the standards of director conduct set forth in this section. That is a task left to the courts and possibly to later revisions
                        of this Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.30 should be read in light of the basic duty of directors set forth in section 8.01(b) that the "business and affairs of a corporation [shall be] managed under the direction of" the board. Since the board may delegate or assign to appropriate
                        officers of the corporation the authority or duty to exercise powers that section 8.01 does not require the board to retain, directors are not personally responsible under section 8.30 for actions or omissions of officers, employees,
                        or agents of the corporation so long as the directors, complying with the standard of care set forth in section 8.30, have acted reasonably in delegating responsibility.

                        Section 8.30(a) establishes a general standard of care for all directors. It requires a director to exercise "the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would exercise." Some state statutes use the words "diligence," "care," and "skill"
                        to define this duty. E.G., N.C. GEN. STAT. ANN.
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 55-35 (1975). There is very little authority as to what "skill" and "diligence," as distinguished from "care," can be required or properly expected of corporate directors in the performance of their duties. "Skill,"
                        in the sense of technical competence in a particular field, should not be a qualification for the office of director. The concept of "diligence" is sufficiently subsumed within the concept of "care." Accordingly, the words "diligence"
                        and "skill" were omitted from the standard adopted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Likewise, section 8.30 does not use the term "fiduciary" in the standard for directors' conduct, because that term could be confused with the unique attributes and obligations of a fiduciary imposed by the law of trusts, some of which are not appropriate
                        for directors of a corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Several of the phrases chosen to define the general standard of care in section 8.30(a) deserve specific mention.

                            The reference to "ordinarily prudent person" embodies long traditions of the common law, in contrast to suggested standards that might call for some undefined degree of expertise, like "ordinarily prudent businessman." The phrase recognizes the need for
                            innovation, essential to profit orientation, and focuses on the basic director attributes of common sense, practical wisdom, and informed judgment.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t55a08s55-8-30-officialcommentol22">
                            The phrase "in a like position" recognizes that the "care" under consideration is that which would be used by the "ordinarily prudent person" if he were a director of the particular corporation.
                        </li>
                        <li id="t55a08s55-8-30-officialcommentol23">
                            The combined phrase "in a like position . . . under similar circumstances" is intended to recognize that (a) the nature and extent of responsibilities will vary, depending upon such factors as the size, complexity, urgency, and location of activities
                            carried on by the particular corporation, (b) decisions must be made on the basis of the information known to the directors without the benefit of hindsight, and (c) the special background, qualifications, and management responsibilities
                            of a particular director may be relevant in evaluating his compliance with the standard of care. Even though the quoted phrase takes into account the special background, qualifications and management responsibilities of a particular
                            director, it does not excuse a director lacking business experience or particular expertise from exercising the common sense, practical wisdom, and informed judgment of an "ordinarily prudent person."

                    <p>
                        The process by which a director informs himself will vary but the duty of care requires every director to take steps to become informed about the background facts and circumstances before taking action on the matter at hand. In relying upon the performance
                        by management of delegated or assigned duties pursuant to section 8.01 (including, for example, matters of law and legal compliance), the director may depend upon the presumption of regularity, absent knowledge or notice to the
                        contrary. A director may also rely on information, opinions, reports, and statements prepared or presented by others as set forth in section 8.30(b). Furthermore, a director should not be expected to anticipate the problems which
                        the corporation may face except in those circumstances where something has occurred to make it obvious to the director that the corporation should be addressing a particular problem.

                    <p>
                        A director complying with the standards expressed in section 8.30(a) is entitled to rely upon information, opinions, reports or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, prepared or presented by the persons or committees described
                        in section 8.30(b). The right to rely under this section applies to the entire range of matters for which the board of directors is responsible. Under section 8.30(c), however, a director so relying must be without knowledge concerning
                        the matter in question that would cause his reliance to be unwarranted. Also inherent in the concept of good faith is the requirement that, in order to be entitled to rely on a report, statement, opinion, or other matter, the director
                        must have read the report or statement in question, or have been present at a meeting at which it was orally presented, or have taken other steps to become generally familiar with its contents. In short, the director must comply
                        with the general standard of care of section 8.30(a) in making a judgment as to the reliability and competence of the source of information upon which he proposes to rely.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.30(b) permits reliance upon outside advisers, including not only those in the professional disciplines customarily supervised by state authorities, such as lawyers, accountants, and engineers, but also those in other fields involving special
                        experience and skills, such as investment bankers, geologists, management consultants, actuaries, and real estate appraisers. The concept of "expert competence" in section 8.30(b)(2) embraces a wide variety of qualifications and
                        is not limited to the more precise and narrower recognition of experts under the Securities Act of 1933. In this respect section 8.30(b) goes beyond any existing state business corporation act, although several state statutes permit
                        reliance on reports of appraisers selected with reasonable care by the board of directors and deal with the scope and nature of corporate reports and records generally.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.30(b) permits reliance upon a committee of the board of directors when performing a supervisory or other functions in instances where neither the full board of directors nor the committee takes dispositive action. For example, there may be reliance
                        upon an investigation undertaken by a board committee and reported to the full board of directors, which forms the basis for action by the board of directors itself. Another example is reliance upon a committee of the board of
                        directors, such as a corporate audit committee, with respect to the ongoing role of oversight of the accounting and auditing functions of the corporation. In addition, where reliance upon information or materials prepared or presented
                        by a board committee is not involved, a director may properly rely on dispositive action by a board committee (of which he is not a member) empowered to act pursuant to authority delegated under section 8.25 or acting with the
                        acquiescence of the board of directors. In this connection, see the Official Comment to section 8.25. A director may similarly rely on committees not created under section 8.25 which have nondirector members.

                        In conditioning reliance upon reasonable belief that the board committee merits the director's "confidence," section 8.30(b)(3) recognizes a difference between a board committee and an expert. In sections 8.30(b)(1) and (2) the reference is to "competence
                        of an expert," which recognizes the expectation of experience and in most instances technical skills on the part of those upon whom the director may rely. In section 8.30(b)(3), the concept of "confidence" is substituted for "competence"
                        in order to avoid any inference that technical skills are a prerequisite.

                        By identifying those upon whom a director may rely in discharging his duties, section 8.30(b) does not limit the ability of directors to delegate their powers under section 8.01(a) to committees of the board of directors or officers of the corporation,
                        except where this delegation is expressly prohibited by the Act. Delegation should be carried out in accordance with the standards set forth in section 8.30(a). See also section 8.25 and its Official Comment with respect to delegation
                        to committees.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.30(c) expressly prevents a director from "hiding his head in the sand" and relying on information, opinions, reports, or statements when he has actual knowledge which makes reliance unwarranted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.30(d) follows former section 35 of the Model Act, which provided that "An individual who performs the duties of his office in accordance with this section is not liable for serving or having served as a director." Thus, both former section 35
                        and current section 8.30(d) are self-executing, and the individual director's exoneration from liability is automatic. If compliance with the standard of conduct set forth in former section 35 or section 8.30 is established, there
                        is no need to consider possible application of the business judgment rule. The possible application of the business judgment rule need only be considered if compliance with the standard of conduct set forth in former section 35
                        or section 8.30 is not established.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.30(d) makes clear that the section will apply whether or not affirmative action was in fact taken. If the board of directors or a committee considers an issue (such as a recommendation of independent auditors concerning the corporation's internal
                        accounting controls) and determines not to take action, the determination not to act is protected by section 8.30. Similarly, if the board of directors or committee delegates responsibility for handling a matter to subordinates,
                        the delegation constitutes "action" under section 8.30. Section 8.30(d) applies (assuming its requirements are satisfied) to any conscious consideration of matters involving the affairs of the corporation. It also applies to the
                        determination by the board of directors of which matters to address and which not to address. Section 8.30(d) does not apply only when the director has failed to consider taking action which under the circumstances he is obliged
                        to consider taking.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.30 generally deals only with directors. Section 8.42 and its Official Comment explain the extent to which the provisions of section 8.30 apply to officers.

        NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY

                    <p>
                        Although the word "fiduciary" is no longer used in describing the duty owed by a director to a corporation, there is no intent to change North Carolina law in this area. The decision not to bring forward the language stating that a director shall "be
                        deemed to stand in a fiduciary relation to the corporation" in former G.S. 55-35 is not intended to modify in any way the duty of directors recognized under the former law. Removal of the word "fiduciary" was solely because of
                        confusion in other jurisdictions between the corporate and the trust standards of fiduciary duty. This Act does not attempt to define the full range of a director's duty, since the language chosen might be used to limit the standards
                        under which directors should act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 55-35 provided that officers and directors stand in a fiduciary relation "to the corporation and to its shareholders." The drafters decided not to bring forward the words "and to its shareholders" in order to avoid an interpretation that there
                        is a duty running directly from directors to the shareholders that would give shareholders a direct right of action on claims that should be asserted derivatively.

   </i> , <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 204</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 593 (1980), suggesting that directors owe a fiduciary duty to creditors. The drafters considered adding a new section 55-8-34 expressly stating that the directors
                        do not have any such duty to creditors; but, because of the complexities and novelty of such a provision, they finally decided not to add the new section but instead to express in this Comment their opinion that in general no such
                        duty exists.

                        Subsection (c) of this section is different from the Model Act in two respects. First, it requires "actual" knowledge for a director to be denied the right of reliance under subsection (b); and, second, it says more specifically that a director who has
                        such knowledge is not "entitled to the benefit of subsection (b)" instead of saying that such director is not "acting in good faith."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (e) of the section was added to the Model Act's provisions to clarify the two points covered. It should be noted that a provision in the articles of incorporation that limits a director's monetary liability for a breach of the duty of due care
                        does not affect the duty of due care itself.

                        interests and not in the best interests of the HOA or within the applicable limitations period. Conleys Creek Limited Partnership v. Smoky Mt. Country Club Prop. Owners Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 695</cite>,

                        Fiduciary Duty as Question Where Revolving Fund Certificate Was Issued. - Revolving fund certificate held by plaintiff issued in exchange for stock sold to defendant had some characteristics of a corporation/shareholder relationship; therefore, issue

                        Shareholder's claims that corporate officers misrepresented the corporation's financial health, causing the value of its stock to decline, had to be brought in a derivative suit rather than an individual action. The special duty exception did not apply,
                        as the fiduciary duty of disclosure was owed to the corporation itself under North Carolina law and did not give the shareholder a direct right of action. Rivers v. Wachovia Corp., 665 F.3d 610 (4th Cir. 2011).

                        favor, the parties' submissions created a genuine issue of material fact as to whether defendants breached their duty of loyalty by diverting a deal from the corporation for which they were directors to another corporation so as

                        Failure to Rely on the Advice of Professionals. - The director of an insolvent insurer did not rely on the advice of accounting and legal professionals, and thus, his statutory right to rely on their advice did not protect him from liability for breach
                        of fiduciary duty in connection with loans made by the insurer, where actual advice received made the director aware that the loans were undercollateralized. State ex rel.

                        A majority of the shares that would if present be entitled to be counted in a vote on the transaction under this subsection constitutes a quorum for the purpose of taking action under this section.

                    <p>
                        Historically, the scope of a director's duty of loyalty to a corporation has been defined by judicial decision rather than by statute. The courts have developed and refined this duty based on increasing sophistication and experience with the corporate
                        form, and the need to encourage honest decisions by directors and to discourage direct or indirect devices by which directors may benefit personally at the expense of creditors or shareholders. Over the years, courts have been
                        vigilant to subject novel transactions and devices to scrutiny.

                    <p>
                        Sections 8.31 and 8.32 deal with various facets of the duty of loyalty. The Model Act, however, does not attempt to define the full range of this duty. Indeed, any such attempt would probably be self-defeating since the language chosen might be used to
                        limit prematurely the standards under which directors should act.

                        Section 8.31 deals only with "conflict of interest" transactions by a director with the corporation, that its, transactions in which the director has an interest either (1) directly or (2) indirectly through an entity in which the director has a financial
                        or managerial interest covered by section 8.31(b). A conflict of interest transaction does not include transactions in which the director participates in the transaction only as a shareholder and receives only a proportionate share
                        of the advantage or benefit of the transaction. Section 8.31 deals only with conflict of interest transactions involving directors; it does not address analogous transactions entered into by officers, employees, or substantial
                        or dominating shareholders unless they are also directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.31 rejects the common law view that all conflict of interest transactions entered into by directors are automatically voidable at the option of the corporation without regard to the fairness of the transaction or the manner in which the transaction
                        was approved by the corporation. Section 8.31(a) makes any automatic rule of voidability inapplicable to transactions that are fair or that have been approved by directors or shareholders in the manner provided by the balance of
                        section 8.31. The approval mechanisms set forth in section 8.31(c) and (d) relate only to the elimination of this automatic rule of voidability and do not address the manner in which the transactions must be approved under other
                        sections of this Act. This is made clear by the express limitations in sections 8.31(c) and (d) that they are applicable only "for the purposes of this section" as well as the language of the second and third sentences of section
                        8.31(d).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The elimination of the automatic rule of voidability does not mean that all transactions that meet one or more of the tests set forth in section 8.31(a) are automatically valid. These transactions may be subject to attack on a variety of grounds independent
                        of section 8.31 - for example, that the transaction constituted waste, that it was not authorized by the appropriate corporate body, that it violated other sections of the Model Business Corporation Act, or that it was unenforceable
                        under other common law principles. The sole purpose of section 8.31 is to sharply limit the common law principle of automatic voidability and in this respect section 8.31 follows earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes
                        of many states dealing with conflict of interest transactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 8.31(c) and (d) provide special rules for determining whether the board of directors (or a committee thereof) or the shareholders have authorized, approved, or ratified a conflict of interest transaction so as to bring subsections (a)(1) or (a)(2)
                        into play. Basically, these subsections require the transaction in question to be approved by an absolute majority of the directors (on the board of directors, or on the committee, as the case may be) or shares whose votes may
                        be counted in determining whether the transaction should be authorized, approved, or ratified. If these votes are not obtained the transaction is tested under the fairness test of subsection (a)(3). The vote required for authorization,
                        approval, or ratification of a conflict of interest transaction is more onerous than the standard applicable to normal voting requirements for approval of corporate actions - i.e., that a quorum be present and only the votes of
                        directors or shares present or represented at that meeting be considered - because of the importance of assuring that conflict of interest transactions receive as broad consideration within the corporation as possible if independent
                        review on the basis of fairness is to be avoided.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.31(c) provides that if a conflict of interest transaction is to be considered by the board of directors or a committee of the board, only the votes of directors "who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction" may be counted in determining
                        whether to authorize, approve, or ratify the transaction. A vote mistakenly cast by an interested director, however, does not affect the validity of the authorization, approval, or ratification by a committee or by the board of
                        directors under section 8.31 if it otherwise meets the requirement of this subsection. The presence of the interested director at the meeting similarly does not affect the validity of the action by the disinterested directors.
                        Because of the voting disqualification of interested directors, section 8.31(c) provides that a majority of the disinterested directors on the committee or on the board of directors, as the case may be, constitute a quorum for
                        purposes of authorizing, approving, or ratifying the conflict of interest transaction under section 8.31, subject always, however, to the requirement that more than one director must approve the transaction. This two director minimum
                        is applicable to a committee of the board of directors as well as the board of directors itself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When a director's conflict of interest transaction is considered by the shareholders, section 8.31(d) applies a similar but somewhat more complex prohibition: votes by shares "owned by or voted under the control of a director who has a direct or indirect
                        interest in the transaction" and votes by shares "owned by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (b)(1)" - that is, an entity in which the director has a material financial interest or is a general partner
                        - may not be counted. This prohibition is based on the belief that the same considerations that prevent votes cast be interested directors from being counted in favor of a conflict of interest transaction also compel the conclusion
                        that votes cast by shares owned or controlled by them, or by entities involved in the transaction in which they have a material financial interest, should also not be counted when the issue is the authorization, approval, or ratification
                        of a conflict of interest transaction under section 8.31. A similar prohibition does not appear in section 41 of the 1969 Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some situations, the prohibition of section 8.31(d) will result in the conflict of interest issue being resolved by a majority of a minority of the shares. This will occur, for example, whenever a director who is the majority shareholder of the corporation
                        is interested in a transaction. The vote on the conflict of interest issue under section 8.31, however, must be distinguished from the vote on the approval of the transaction itself under other sections of the Model Act, in which
                        there is no prohibition against the voting of shares owned or controlled by an interested director. For example, if a parent corporation wishes to merge its 60-percent-owned subsidiary into itself, and the majority shareholder
                        of the parent is a director of the subsidiary, the votes of the shares owned by the parent corporation may not be counted under section 8.31(d) (since the shares are owned by an entity which is a party to the transaction and which
                        the director controls). The shares nevertheless may be voted on the merger proposal itself under chapter 11 of the Model Act, and the merger will, of course, normally be approved solely by the vote of the shares owned by the parent
                        corporation. On the other hand, the test of section 8.31(a)(2) is not met unless the transaction is approved by at least a majority of the votes cast by the holders of the 40 percent of the shares not owned by the parent corporation.
                        If this requirement is not met, the transaction may be evaluated under the fairness test of section 8.31(a)(3).

                    <p>
                        Section 8.31 is applicable to "indirect" as well as direct conflicts; "indirect" is defined in section 8.31(b) to cover transactions between the corporation and an entity in which the director has a material financial interest or is a general partner.
                        Further, section 8.31(b) covers indirect conflicts where the director is an officer or director of another entity (but does not have a material financial interest in the transaction) if the transaction is of sufficient importance
                        that it is or should be considered by the board of directors of the corporation. The purpose of this last clause is to permit normal business transactions between large business entities that may have a common director to go forward
                        without concern about the technical rules relating to conflict of interest unless the transaction is of such importance that it is or should be considered by the board of directors or the director may be deemed to have a material
                        financial interest in the transaction. Thus, section 8.31 covers transactions between corporations with interlocking or common directors as well as the direct "interested director" transaction.

                    <p>
                        The fairness of a transaction for purposes of section 8.31 should be evaluated on the basis of the facts and circumstances as they were known or should have been known at the time the transaction was entered into. For example, the terms of a transaction
                        subject to section 8.31 should normally be deemed "fair" if they are within the range that might have been entered into at arm's-length by disinterested persons.

                    <p>
                        The Model Act does not attempt to define precisely when a director should be viewed as "interested" for purposes of participating in the decision to adopt, approve, or ratify a conflict of interest transaction. Secton 8.31(b) does, however, define one
                        aspect of this concept - the "indirect" interest. For purposes of section 8.31 a director should normally be viewed as interested in a transaction if he or the immediate members of his family have a financial interest in the transaction
                        or a relationship with the other parties to the transaction such that the relationship might reasonably be expected to affect his judgment in the particular matter in a manner adverse to the corporation.

                        This section replaces former G.S. 55-30(b); subsection (a) of the prior law is covered by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-11" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-11</a></cite>. The section is more precise than former G.S. 55-30(b)
                        in several respects. First, it says that a conflict of interest transaction "is not voidable by the corporation solely because of the director's interest" if it passes one of the three prescribed tests, thus recognizing that it
                        might be voidable for some other reason. Second, subsection (b) of this section defines "indirect interest." Finally, subsections (c) and (d) define the manner in which the transaction may be approved by the disinterested directors
                        or shareholders, respectively. The specific requirement of "good faith" by the directors in former G.S. 55-30(b)(1) is unnecessary because it is generally imposed by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-30" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-30</a></cite>.

                        Derivative Action Against Director Does Not Necessarily Make Him "Adversely Interested." - In a derivative action brought by shareholders against directors of a corporation alleging malfeasance in office, former G.S. 55-30 did not operate to prevent former
                        G.S. 55-19(d) from being effective in allowing the corporation to advance any legal fees to the directors, since the advancement of legal fees under former G.S. 55-19(d) was not necessarily a transaction in which a director was
                        adversely interested, and since, even if it were, the disinterested directors of the corporation had approved the advancement. Swenson v. Thibaut, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 77, 250 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Section 8.32 treats specially a second type of conflict of interest transaction: loans by the corporation to directors (including loans obtained by directors from third persons on the basis of the corporation's credit). Early statutes in many states made
                        all these loans unlawful because they were believed to be inherently subject to abuse; the modern view epitomized by section 8.32 recognizes that these loans may be proper and desirable in some situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basic test for validity under section 8.32(a) is that either (1) the particular loan is approved by a majority of the shares or by the board of directors after a specific finding that the loan benefits the corporation, or (2) the loan is pursuant
                        to a general plan approved by the board of directors as being of benefit to the corporation. This type of plan will normally cover at least directors, officers, and high-level employees, and possibly lower level employees as well.
                        Examples of these plans are employee benefit plans, plans authorizing loans of petty cash, and advances for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of the director, officer, or employee.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.32(b) makes clear that an irregular or improper loan is nevertheless legally enforceable by the corporation by the corporation against the borrower.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.32(c) provides for an exception for loans by banks, savings and loans, and other lending institutions that are authorized by law to make loans to directors in the ordinary course of business. The protections provided by the statutes applicable
                        to these entities render unnecessary the protections provided by section 8.32.

                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 55-22 required shareholder approval of loans to directors, officers, and dominant shareholders. This section permits the board of directors to authorize loans to directors without shareholder approval if the board determines that the loan
                        benefits the corporation. There are no special limits on loans to officers who are not directors or to dominant shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act by the addition of the words "directly or indirectly" to the loan prohibition in subsection (a) of this section. These words are then defined in a new subsection (d).

                    directors to contribution and reimbursement under subsection (b) cannot be cut off before their own liability or lack thereof is determined.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.40 permits every corporation to designate the officers it wants. The designation may be made in the bylaws or by the board of directors consistently with the bylaws. This is a departure from earlier versions of the Model Act and most state corporation
                        acts, which require certain officers, usually the president, the secretary, and the treasurer, and generally authorize the corporation to designate additional or assistant officers. Experience has shown, however, that little purpose
                        is served by a statutory requirement that there be certain officers, and statutory requirements may sometimes create problems of implied or apparent authority or confusion with nonstatutory offices the corporation desires to create.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The board of directors may appoint assistant officers pursuant to its general powers under section 8.40(a); duly appointed officers may also appoint assistant officers if authorized by the board under section 8.40(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Throughout the Model Act, the act of a board designating an officer is referred to as an "appointment" rather than an "election." The Act also consistently uses the word "elect" when referring to the selection of directors, thus emphasizing the difference
                        in the selection process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The board of directors, as well as duly appointed corporate officers or other agents, may also appoint agents for the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The bylaws or the board of directors must also delegate to an officer the responsibility to prepare minutes and authenticate records of the corporation; the person performing this function is referred to as the "secretary" of the corporation throughout
                        the Model Act. See section 1.40. Under this Act a corporation may have this and all other corporate functions performed by a single individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The person who is designated by the bylaws or the board as responsible for maintaining minutes of meetings and authenticating records of the corporation thereby has authority to bind the corporation by his authentication under this section. This delegation
                        of authority, traditionally vested in the corporate "secretary," allows third persons to rely on authenticated records without inquiring into their truth or accuracy.

                        This section was adapted from the corresponding section of the Model Act with several changes. The word "required" was deleted from the catchline of the section because it covers officers that are optional as well as those that are required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No changes were made in subsections (a) and (b). Subsection (b) permits the board of directors to authorize officers to appoint other officers or assistant officers, whereas former G.S. 55-34 was silent on this point. The drafters were in favor of this
                        provision but noted that the appointment should be documented as a practical matter, e.g., in the minute books.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (c) was changed to designate the secretary or any assistant secretary as the officers who have responsibility and authority to maintain and authenticate corporate records, subject to any other provision in the bylaws, in accordance with existing
                        practice, and subsection (d) was changed by adding the final clause relating to acting in a dual capacity when the action of more than one officer is required, thus conforming to former G.S. 55-34(a). Subsection (e) brings forward
                        the last sentence of former G.S. 55-34(a) with updated terminology.

                        Whether Level of Control and Authority Rose to De Facto Director Status. - In a business dispute involving asserted allegations of breach of a covenant-not-to-compete and other claims, a trial court erred by granting defendants summary judgment on the
                        issue of whether one of defendants' level of control and authority rose to the level of a de facto officer as, although none of plaintiff's corporate records indicated that the defendant was the president of plaintiff, testimony
                        from plaintiff stated that the defendant was promoted to that position when the defendant signed the covenant-not-to-compete and other agreements and that the defendant's own business cards named him as president of plaintiff.

                        Section 8.41 recognizes that persons designated as officers have the formal authority set forth for that position (1) by its description in the bylaws, (2) by specific resolution of the board of directors, or (3) by direction of another officer authorized
                        by the board of directors to prescribe the duties of other officers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These methods of investing officers with formal authority do not exhaust the sources of an officer's actual or apparent authority. Many cases state that specific corporate officers, particularly the chief executive officer, may have implied authority
                        merely by virtue of their positions. This authority, which may overlap the express authority granted by the bylaws, generally has been viewed as extending only to ordinary business transactions, though some cases have recognized
                        unusually broad implied authority of the chief executive officer or have created a presumption that corporate officers have broad authority, thereby placing on the corporation the burden of showing lack of authority. Corporate
                        officers may also be vested with apparent (or ostensible) authority by reason of corporate conduct on which third persons reasonably rely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to express, implied, or apparent authority, a corporation is normally bound by unauthorized acts of officers if they are ratified by the board of directors. Generally, ratification extends only to acts that could have been authorized as an
                        original matter. Ratification may itself be express or implied and may in some cases serve as the basis of apparent (or ostensible) authority.

                        This section was modified by deleting the Model Act's words "shall perform the" before the word "duties" in the first use of that word and by adding the words "authority and" before the word "duties" in the other two uses of that word.

                        Former G.S. 55-34(c) expressly gave the president of a corporation authority to institute or defend legal proceedings when the directors are deadlocked.

                        by case basis rather than having a definitive statutory statement that the president can act in such situations.

                        Conduct of Day-to-Day Business. - The day-to-day business of a corporation is actually conducted by its officers, employees and other agents under the authority and control of its board of directors. The officers of a corporation have such authority and
                        may perform such duties in the management of the corporation as provided either specifically or generally in the bylaws, or as may be determined by action of the board of directors not inconsistent with the bylaws. Burlington Indus.,

                        President as Head and General Agent of Corporation. - The president of a corporation by the very nature of his position is the head and general agent of the corporation, and accordingly he may act for the corporation, in the business in which the corporation
                        is engaged. Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Foil, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 740</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 591 (1974).

                    <p>
                        But the authority of the president to act for the corporation is limited to those matters that are incidental to the business in which the corporation is engaged, that is, to matters that are within the corporation's ordinary course of business. Burlington

                        Necessity for Contract for Compensation. - An officer of a corporation, for services in the course and scope of his official duties, can only recover when compensation therefor has been authoritatively agreed upon in advance. It is not always required
                        that a definite sum be fixed upon, but there must be a previous agreement for compensation existent or in some way expressed so as to bind the company. There can be no recovery on a quantum meruit. Chiles v. United States Furn.

                        Defense Based on Unwritten Limitation on Powers. - The president of a corporation is not bound by any secret limitation upon the authority usually vested in the chief officer of a corporation; hence a defense to a note, issued by the president of a corporation,
                        that it was unauthorized because of an unwritten bylaw, is untenable. Phillips v. Interstate Land Co., <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 514</cite>, 97 S.E. 417 (1918).

                        The president of a corporation under former G.S. 55-49 had implied power to sign a note, and secret limitations on his authority were not binding on the payee. White v. Johnson &amp; Sons, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 773</cite>,

                        The secretary of an incorporated garage and automobile repair company had the implied authority to settle claims made for damages upon the corporation, and one so dealing with him therein would not be bound by a secret limitation of his authority; and
                        upon his own testimony that he was the proper one to be dealt with in this respect, the question of the corporation's liability for his promise to pay the claim was properly presented. Beck v. Wilkins-Ricks Co.,

                        Suit for Breach of Duty is Derivative. - Dismissal of all claims against a minority shareholder of a closely held corporation, who was also a former corporate officer of a subsidiary corporation, was appropriate because the majority shareholder lacked
                        standing to maintain a direct action seeking individual recovery against the minority shareholder as the majority shareholder's individual claims based upon the minority shareholder's conduct as an officer, which were derivative
                        in nature, did not fall under an exception to the general rule prohibiting individual shareholder suits. Raymond James Capital Partners, L.P. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 574, 789

                    <p>
                        This section provides that a nondirector officer with discretionary authority must meet the same standards of conduct required of directors under section 8.30. But his ability to rely on information, reports, or statements, may, depending upon the circumstances
                        of the particular case, be more limited than in the case of a director in view of the greater obligation he may have to be familiar with the affairs of the corporation. See section 8.42(b). Nondirector officers with more limited
                        discretionary authority may be judged by a narrower standard, though every corporate officer or agent owes duties of fidelity, honesty, good faith, and fair dealing to the corporation. The Official Comment to section 8.30 is generally
                        applicable to nondirector officers as well as to directors.

                        Subsection (c) of this section is different from the Model Act, first, in requiring "actual" knowledge and, second, in providing that an officer with such knowledge is not "entitled to the benefit of subsection (b)" instead of not "acting in good faith."
                        This change conforms to the change made in subsection 55-8-30(c). Subsection (e) was added for clarification.

                        not own a fiduciary duty to plaintiff or the corporation's other creditors. United States Trouser, S.A. de C.V. v. Int'l Legwear Group, Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. Dec. 13, 2012).

                        Trial court erred in concluding that a corporate officer's failure to remit payroll taxes and make 401(k) contributions did not constitute a breach of fiduciary duties where the failure to make the required payments violated both federal and state law,
                        and the officer knew that the payments remained unpaid during his tenure. Seraph Garrison, LLC v. Garrison, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 115, - S.E.2d - (Apr. 19, 2016).

                        from the contractor for his personal benefit. Seraph Garrison, LLC v. Garrison, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 115, - S.E.2d - (Apr. 19, 2016).

                        Trial court erred in dismissing a homeowners association's (HOA) counterclaim for breach of fiduciary duty as to a director and officer of the HOA because the HOA made a number of allegations which, if true, tended to show that they acted in their own
                        interests and not in the best interests of the HOA or within the applicable limitations period. Conleys Creek Limited Partnership v. Smoky Mt. Country Club Prop. Owners Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 695</cite>,

                        from plaintiff stated that the defendant was promoted to that position when the defendant signed the covenant-not-to-compete and other agreements and that the defendant's own business cards named him as president of plaintiff.

                        Shareholder's claims that corporate officers misrepresented the corporation's financial health, causing the value of its stock to decline, had to be brought in a derivative suit rather than an individual action. The special duty exception did not apply,
                        as the fiduciary duty of disclosure was owed to the corporation itself under North Carolina law and did not give the shareholder a direct right of action. Rivers v. Wachovia Corp., 665 F.3d 610 (4th Cir. 2011).

                        Dismissal of all claims against a minority shareholder of a closely held corporation, who was also a former corporate officer of a subsidiary corporation, was appropriate because the majority shareholder lacked standing to maintain a direct action seeking
                        individual recovery against the minority shareholder as the majority shareholder's individual claims based upon the minority shareholder's conduct as an officer, which were derivative in nature, did not fall under an exception

                        financial statements, the shareholder plaintiffs would be entitled to receive any recovery under these allegations and the action was thus individual. Gilbert v. Bagley, 492 F. Supp. 714 (M.D.N.C. 1980).

                    <p>
                        Section 8.43(a) is declaratory of current law. It recognizes that corporate officers may resign, that, with the consent of the board of directors, they may resign effective at a later date, and that the board of directors may fill a future vacancy to
                        become effective as of the effective date of the resignation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In part because of the unlimited power of removal, confirmed by section 8.43(b), a board of directors may grant an officer an employment contract that extends beyond the term of the board of directors. This type of contract is binding on the corporation
                        even if the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that officers are appointed for a term shorter than the period of the employment contract. If a later board of directors refuses to reappoint that person as an officer, he
                        has the right to sue for damages but not for specific performance of his employment contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.43(b) is also declaratory of current law. The tenure of all corporate officers is subject to the will of the board of directors. If the board of directors loses confidence in a corporate officer, that officer may be removed irrespective of contract
                        rights or the presence or absence of "cause" in a legal sense. Section 8.44 provides that removal of an officer who has contract rights is without prejudice to whatever rights the former officer may assert in a suit for damages
                        for breach of contract.

                        The reference to an officer "communicating his resignation" is broader language than the reference in the Model Act to "delivering notice" of the resignation. This change parallels the change made in section 55-8-07.

                        Removal. - The officers of a corporation created for private purposes have no franchise in their offices, and are removable during the term for which they are appointed, when found to be incompetent or faithless. Eliason v. Coleman,
                        <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 235</cite> (1882).

                        Where plaintiff had no written contract, and his employment was indefinite, he was not wrongfully discharged even though his employment was not terminated by the board of directors. While the board of directors may remove an officer, there is no indication
                        that it is mandatory that it do so. Buffaloe v. United Carolina Bank, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 366 S.E.2d 918 (1988).

                        Section 8.43 makes clear that the appointment of an officer does not itself create contract rights in the officer. The removal of an officer with contract rights is without prejudice to his later enforcement of contract rights in a suit for damages for
                        breach of contract. See the Official Comment to section 8.43. Similarly, an officer with an employment contract who prematurely resigns may be in breach of his employment contract. The mere appointment of an officer for a term
                        does not create a contractual obligation on his part to complete the term.

                        A special definition of "corporation" is included in subchapter E to make it clear that predecessor entities that have been absorbed in mergers or other transactions are included within the definition. It is probable that the same result would be reached
                        for many transactions under section 11.06 (effect of merger or share exchange), which provides for the assumption of liabilities by operation of law upon a merger. The express responsibility of successor entities for the liabilities
                        of their predecessors under this subchapter is broader than under section 11.06 and may impose liability on a successor although section 11.06 does not. Section 8.50(1) is thus an essential aspect of the protection provided by
                        this subchapter for persons eligible for indemnification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A special definition of "director" is included in subchapter E to make it clear that a person who is or was a director is covered by this subchapter while serving at the corporation's request in another enterprise. The purpose of this definition is to
                        give directors the benefits of the protection of this subchapter while serving at the corporation's request in a responsible position in employee benefit plans, trade associations, nonprofit or charitable entities, foreign or domestic
                        entities, and other kinds of profit or nonprofit ventures. A director serving at the corporation's request in such a venture is viewed as acting as a director of the corporation for purposes of this subchapter even though he is
                        also acting in some other capacity in the other venture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second sentence of section 8.50(2) addresses the question of liabilities arising under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). It makes clear that a director who is serving as a fiduciary of an employee benefit plan is nevertheless viewed
                        as acting as a director for purposes of this subchapter. Special treatment is felt to be necessary because of the broad definition of "fiduciary" in section 3(21) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 1002(21) (1974), and the requirement of section 404 (
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 1104(a)) that a "fiduciary" must discharge his duties "solely in the interest" of the participants and beneficiaries of the employee benefit plan. Decisions by a director serving as a fiduciary under the plan on
                        questions regarding eligibility for benefits, investment decisions, and interpretation of plan provisions regarding qualifying service, years of service, and retroactivity are all subject to the protections of this subchapter.
                        See also sections 8.50(4) and 8.51(b) of this subchapter. Similar provisions appear in the business corporation acts of New York, N.Y. BUS. CORP. LAW ANN.
                        <span class="s1">

                        The estate or personal representative of a director is entitled to the rights of indemnification possessed by the director himself. See the last sentence of section 8.50(2). The phrase, "unless the context requires otherwise," was added to make clear
                        that the estate or personal representative did not have the right to participate in directoral decisions whether to grant indemnification authorized in this subchapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Expenses" is defined to include counsel fees to avoid repeated references to such fees every time "expenses" appears throughout the subchapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Liability" is defined for convenience, to avoid repeated references to recoverable items throughout the subchapter. Even though the definition of "liability" includes both expenses and amounts paid to satisfy or to settle substantive claims, indemnification
                        against substantive claims is not allowed in several provisions in subchapter E. For example, indemnification in suits brought by or in the name of the corporation is limited to expenses. See section 8.51(e).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "liability" permits the indemnification only of "reasonable expenses incurred." The intention is that any portion of expenses falling outside the perimeter of reasonableness should not be indemnified, and that, if necessary, an allocation
                        of expenses should be made. By contrast, unlike earlier versions of the Model Act and statutes of many states, section 8.50(4) provides that amounts paid to settle or satisfy substantive claims are not subject to a reasonableness
                        test. Since payment of these amounts is permissive - mandatory indemnification is available under section 8.52 only where the defendant is "wholly successful" - a special limitation of "reasonableness" for settlements is inappropriate.
                        Further, it is undesirable to base the statutory test of power to indemnify on an affirmative finding that a settlement is reasonable. Indeed, the grant of authority to indemnify only those settlements that are "reasonable" would
                        suggest an "all or nothing" approach inconsistent with the basic philosophy of indemnification of "reasonable" expenses.

                        "Penalties" and "fines" are expressly included within the definition of "liability" so that in appropriate cases these items may also be indemnified. See section 8.51. The purpose of this definition is to cover every type of monetary obligation that may
                        be imposed upon a director, including civil penalties (which have been authorized in a number of recent statutes), restitution, and obligations to give notice (which are proposed as part of the revision of the federal criminal
                        code). This definition also expressly includes the levy of excise taxes under the Internal Revenue Code pursuant to ERISA within the definition of "fines."

                    <p>
                        The definition of "official capacity" is necessary because the term determines which of the two alternative standards of conduct set forth in section 8.51 applies: if action is taken in an "official capacity," the person to be indemnified must have reasonably
                        believed he was acting in the best interests of the corporation, while if the action in question was not taken in his "official capacity," he need only have reasonably believed that the conduct was not opposed to the best interests
                        of the corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The definition of "party" establishes the basic coverage of the subchapter. The definition includes every individual "who was, is, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a proceeding." A person who is only called as a witness is
                        not a "party" within this definition, and as specifically provided in section 8.58(b), indemnification of this person is not limited by this subchapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The broad definition of "proceeding" ensures that the benefits of this subchapter will be available to directors in new and unexpected, as well as traditional, types of proceedings whether civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative. It also includes
                        appeals in lawsuits and petitions to review administrative actions.

                    <p>
                        The definitions in subsection (b) are essentially the same as in the Model Act, and in the opinion of the drafters they all broaden the scope of prior law. For example, "corporation" includes predecessor entities (e.g., in a merger), whether or not incorporated;
                        "director" broadens the coverage of persons who have responsibilities with respect to employee benefit plans and includes the successors of deceased directors; "party" includes persons who are threatened to be named as a party;
                        and "proceeding" includes any kind of formal or informal proceeding, whether threatened or actual. The drafters do not believe there are any uncertainties or ambiguities in any of these definitions that permit a court to limit
                        their scope, and any contrary restrictive decision by a court of another jurisdiction should be overridden by the broad public policy intent expressed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-50ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-50(a)</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        The standards for indemnification of directors contained in this subsection define the outer limits for which voluntary indemnification is permitted under the Model Act. Conduct which does not meet these standards is not eligible for voluntary indemnification
                        under the Model Act, although court-ordered indemnification may be available under section 8.54(2). Conduct that falls within these outer limits does not automatically entitle directors to indemnification, although many corporations
                        have adopted bylaw provisions that obligate the corporation to indemnify directors to the maximum extent permitted by statute. Absent such a bylaw provision, section 8.52 defines a much narrower area in which the directors are
                        entitled as a matter of right to indemnification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some state statutes provide separate, but usually similarly worded, standards for indemnification in third-party suits and indemnification in suits brought by or in the name of the corporation. The Model Act establishes a single uniform test to make clear
                        that the outer limits of conduct for which indemnification is permitted should not be dependent on the type of proceeding in which the claim arises. To prevent circularity in recovery, however, section 8.51(e) limits indemnification
                        in connection with suits brought by or in the name of the corporation to expenses incurred and excludes amounts paid to settle or satisfy substantive claims.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The standards of conduct described in sections 8.5(a)(1) and 8.5(a)(2)(i) - that a director's conduct in his official capacity was in "good faith" and in the corporation's "best interests" - is closely related to the basic standards of conduct imposed
                        by section 8.30, but the two standards are not identical. No attempt is made to define "good faith," a term used in both section 8.30 and section 8.51. The concept of good faith involves a subjective test, which would include "a
                        mistake of judgment," in the words of the Official Comment to section 8.30, even though made unwisely by objective standards. But the affirmative requirement of section 8.30 - that the "care of an ordinarily prudent person in a
                        like position" be exercised - is not included in the standard of conduct for indemnification. On the other hand, section 8.51 requires that there be a "reasonable" belief on the part of the director in most instances, and in the
                        case of criminal proceedings that there be no "reasonable" cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. Accordingly, it is possible that a director who has not acted "with the care an ordinarily prudent person in a like position
                        would exercise under similar circumstances," as required by section 8.30, could nevertheless be indemnified if the standard of section 8.51 were met. As a corollary, it is clear that a director who has met the section 8.30 standards
                        of conduct would be eligible in virtually every case to be indemnified under section 8.51.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.5(a)(2)(ii) requires, if a director is not acting in his official capacity, that his action be "at least not opposed to" the corporation's best interests. This standard is applicable to the director when serving another entity at the request
                        of the corporation or when sued simply because he is or was a director. The words "at least" were added to qualify "not opposed to" in order to make it clear that this test is an outer limit for conduct other than in an official
                        capacity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section makes clear that a director who is serving as a trustee or fiduciary for an employee benefit plan under ERISA meets the standard for indemnification under section 8.51(a) if he reasonably believes his conduct was in the best interests of
                        the participants in and beneficiaries of the plan. This standard is a specific application of the more general test that conduct not in official corporate capacity is indemnifiable if it is "at least not opposed to" the best interests
                        of the corporation and provides a standard for indemnification that is consistent with the statutory policies embodied in ERISA. See the Official Comment to section 8.50.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of section 8.51(c) is to reject the argument that indemnification is automatically improper whenever a proceeding has been terminated on a basis that does not exonerate the director claiming indemnification. Even though a final judgment or
                        conviction is not automatically determinative of the issue whether the minimum standard of conduct was met, any judicial determination of substantive liability would in most instances be entitled to considerable weight. By the
                        same token, it is clear that the termination of a proceeding by settlement or plea of nolo contendere should not of itself create a presumption either that conduct met or did not meet the standard of section 8.51. On the other
                        hand, a final determination of nonliability or acquittal automatically entitles the director to indemnification of expenses under section 8.52.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.51(c) applies expressly to indemnification expenses in derivative actions as well as to indemnification in third party suits. The most likely application of this subsection to derivative actions will be to settlements since a judgment or order
                        would normally result in liability to the corporation and thereby preclude all indemnification under section 8.51(d). In the rare event that a judgment or order entered against the director did not include a determination of liability
                        to the corporation, the entry of the judgment or order would not be determinative that the director failed to meet the requisite standard of conduct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This subsection makes clear that indemnification is not permissible under section 8.51 in the face of a finding of improper conduct either because liability is imposed in favor of the corporation in a suit brought by or in its name or because there is
                        a finding that the director improperly received a personal benefit as a result of his conduct. Indemnification under this subsection is prohibited if a director is adjudged liable in a derivative suit because it is believed that
                        there should be no indemnification in this situation unless a court first finds it proper. Section 8.54 permits a director found liable to the corporation to petition a court for a judicial determination of entitlement to indemnification.
                        Voluntary indemnification is also prohibited if there has been an adjudication that a director improperly received a personal benefit, even if, for example, he acted in a manner not opposed to the best interests of the corporation.
                        Improper use of inside information for personal benefit should not be an action for which the corporation may provide indemnification, even if the corporation was not thereby harmed. Although it is unlikely that a person found
                        liable for receiving an improper personal benefit would be found to have met the statutory standard of conduct set forth in section 8.51(a)(2)(ii), this limitation is made explicit in section 8.51(d)(2). Recourse to a court under
                        section 8.54 may also be appropriate in some improper benefit cases - for example, where it would be unfair for a small personal benefit to foreclose indemnification in an expensive and complicated matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This subsection limits indemnification in suits brought by or in the right of the corporation to expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding. Its purpose is to avoid circularity that would be involved if a corporation seeks to indemnify a director
                        for payments made in settlement by the director to the corporation. This subsection applies only to settlements since all indemnification is prohibited by section 8.5(d)(1) - subject to the right to seek judicially approved indemnification
                        under section 8.54 - in cases where a director is "adjudged" liable to the corporation.

                        This section differs in two respects from Section 8.51 of the Model Act. First, the qualifying clause "that is concluded without a final adjudication on the issue of liability" was added to subsection (e) to make it clear that the subsection applies only
                        to settlements, as noted in the Official Comment on that subsection, and thus to remove any possible conflict with the prohibition in subdivision (d)(1) against indemnification under this section in a proceeding in which the director
                        was adjudged liable to the corporation. Second, the entire subsection (f) was added.

                        Section 8.51 determines whether indemnification may be made voluntarily by a corporation if it elects to do so. Section 8.52 determines whether a corporation must indemnify a director for his expenses; in other words, section 8.52 creates a statutory
                        right of indemnification in favor of the director who meets the requirements of that section. Enforcement of this right by judicial proceeding is specifically contemplated by section 8.54(1), which also gives the director a statutory
                        right to recover expenses incurred by him in enforcing his statutory right to indemnification under section 8.52.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The basic standard for mandatory indemnification is that the director has been "wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise," in the defense of the proceeding. The word "wholly" is added to avoid the argument accepted in
                        <i>
        Merritt-Chapman &amp; Scott Corp. v. Wolfson,
       </i> 321 A.2d 138 (Del. 1974), that a defendant may be entitled to partial mandatory indemnification if he succeeded by plea bargaining or otherwise to obtain the dismissal of some but not all counts of an indictment. A
                        defendant is "wholly successful" only if the entire proceeding is disposed of on a basis which involves a finding of nonliability. However, the language in earlier versions of the Model Act and in many other state statutes that
                        the basis of success may be "on the merits or otherwise" is retained. While this standard may result in an occasional defendant becoming entitled to indemnification because of procedural defenses not related to the merits - e.g.,
                        the statute of limitations or disqualification of the plaintiff, it is unreasonable to require a defendant with a valid procedural defense to undergo a possibly prolonged and expensive trial on the merits in order to establish
                        eligibility for mandatory indemnification.

                    <p>
                        It is often critically important to a director who is made a party to a complex proceeding that the corporation he served have power to make advances for expenses at the beginning of and during the proceeding. Adequate legal representation and adequate
                        preparation of a defense may require substantial payments of expenses before a final determination, and unless the corporation may make advances for expenses, a defendant may be unable to finance his own defense. This problem is
                        complicated by reason of the fact that during the early stages of a proceeding (when advances are often needed) the facts underlying the claim cannot be fully evaluated and the board of directors therefore cannot accurately ascertain
                        the ultimate propriety of indemnification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.53 establishes a workable standard: indemnification is permitted if the facts then known to those making the determination do not establish that indemnification would be precluded under section 8.51. The directors (or special legal counsel)
                        making the determination under section 8.53(c) would normally communicate with counsel and the person or persons monitoring the matter for the corporation in order to gain familiarity with the status of the proceeding and the relevant
                        facts that have emerged, but it is not required (or expected) that any form of independent investigation be undertaken for purposes of the determination. Thus, an advance may be made under section 8.53 unless it becomes clear,
                        from the facts at hand, that indemnification under section 8.51 cannot be provided. As additional facts become known, a different determination may be required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section is a compromise between the view of some that advances should be made automatically at the claimant's request and at any time before the litigation is terminated and the view of others that a special investigation should be made before each
                        advance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to the requirement that the facts then known to those acting on the request for an advance do not preclude indemnification, section 8.53(a) requires a written affirmation by the director of his good faith belief that he has met the standard
                        of conduct necessary for indemnification by the corporation and a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director to repay the advance if it is ultimately determined that he has not met the standard of conduct. Under section
                        8.53(b), the undertaking need not be secured and financial ability to repay is not a prerequisite. The theory underlying this subsection is that, in advancing expenses, wealthy directors should not be favored over directors whose
                        financial resources are modest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The limitations of section 8.53 apply only to persons who are directors at the time the advance is made. Thus the corporation may advance the expenses of former directors without obtaining the undertaking otherwise required by section 8.53(a)(1) or (2).

                    Unless a corporation's articles of incorporation provide otherwise, a director of the corporation who is a party to a proceeding may apply for indemnification to the court conducting the proceeding or to another court of competent jurisdiction. On receipt

                    <p>
                        Section 8.54 permits court-ordered indemnification in two situations: (1) a director entitled to mandatory indemnification may enforce that entitlement by judicial proceeding (in which case the court may also order the corporation to pay the reasonable
                        expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding); and (2) indemnification at the court's discretion is permitted in all cases whether or not the director met the requisite standard of conduct in section 8.51 or is otherwise
                        ineligible for indemnification. But indemnification with respect to derivative suits or improper benefit is always limited to expenses by the last clause of section 8.54(2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Application for indemnification under section 8.54 may be made either to the court in which the proceeding was heard or to another court of appropriate jurisdiction. For example, a defendant in a criminal action who has been convicted but believes that
                        indemnification would be proper could apply either to the court which heard the criminal action or bring an action against the corporation in another court. A decision by the board of directors not to oppose the request for indemnification
                        is governed by the general standards of conduct found in section 8.30. Even if the corporation decided not to oppose the request, the court must satisfy itself that the person seeking indemnification is properly entitled to it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A corporation may limit the right of a director under section 8.54 by a provision in its articles of incorporation. In the absence of such a provision, however, the court has general power to grant indemnification under this section.

                        Section 8.55 provides the method for determining whether a corporation should voluntarily indemnify directors under section 8.51. In this section a distinction is made between a "determination" and an "authorization." A "determination" involves a decision
                        whether under the circumstances the person seeking indemnification has met the requisite standard of conduct under section 8.51 and is therefore eligible for indemnification. This decision may be made by the persons or groups described
                        in section 8.55(b). In addition, after a favorable "determination" is made, the corporation must "authorize" indemnification; this includes a review of the reasonableness of the expenses, the financial ability of the corporation
                        to make the payment, and the judgment whether limited financial resources should be devoted to this or some other use by the corporation. Section 8.55(c) provides that "authorization" of indemnification may be made only by the
                        board of directors, by a committee of the board, or by the shareholders. While special legal counsel may make the "determination" of eligibility for indemnification, he may not "authorize" the indemnification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.55(b) establishes a procedure for selecting the person or persons who will make the determination of eligibility for indemnification. Even though directors who are parties to the proceeding may not participate in the decision determining eligibility
                        for indemnification, they may, if necessary to permit valid action by the board of directors, participate in the decision establishing a committee of independent directors or selecting special legal counsel. Directors who are parties
                        may also participate in the decision to "authorize" indemnification on the basis of a favorable "determination" if necessary to permit action by the board of directors. This limited participation of interested directors in the
                        decision is justified by a principle of necessity.

                    <p>
                        Legal counsel authorized to make the required determination is referred to as "special legal counsel." In earlier versions of the Model Act, and in the statutes of many states, he is referred to as "independent" legal counsel. The word "special" is felt
                        to be more descriptive of the role to be performed and is not intended to indicate that the counsel selected should not be independent in accordance with governing legal precepts. "Special legal counsel" should normally be counsel
                        having no prior professional relationship with those seeking indemnification, should be retained for the specific occasion, and should not be either inside counsel or regular outside counsel. It is important that the selection
                        process be sufficiently flexible to permit selection of counsel in light of the particular circumstances and so that unnecessary expense may be avoided. Hence the phrase "special legal counsel" is not defined in the statute.

                    <p>
                        Determinations by shareholders rather than by directors or special counsel are permitted by section 8.55(b)(4), but shares owned by or voted under the control of directors seeking indemnification may not be voted on the determination of eligibility for
                        indemnification. This does not affect rules governing the determination of a quorum at the meeting.

                        Section 8.56 correlates the general legal principles relating to the indemnification of officers, employees, and agents of the corporation with the limitations on indemnification in subchapter E. This correlation may be summarized in general terms as
                        follows:

                            Subchapter E (except for section 8.56) applies only to, and limits the indemnification of, directors.

                        <li id="t55a08s55-8-56-officialcommentol12">
                            An officer, agent or employee of a corporation who is not a director may be indemnified by the corporation on a discretionary basis to the same extent as though he were a director, and, in addition, may have additional indemnification rights apart from
                            subchapter E. (Section 8.56(2) and (3).)

                            is limited to his rights under subchapter E even though he is sued solely in his capacity as an officer.

                    <p>
                        Section 8.56(3) authorizes indemnification for officers, employees, and agents who are not directors, but neither requires nor prescribes standards for their indemnification and expressly states that their indemnification may be broader than the right
                        of indemnification granted to directors by this subchapter. The rights of employees or agents may derive from principles of agency, the doctrine of respondeat superior, or collective bargaining or other contractual agreement, rather
                        than from the statute. Indemnification of employees or agents may appropriately protect the person indemnified from liabilities incurred while serving at the corporation's request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, or agent
                        of another commercial, charitable, or nonprofit enterprise. See the definition of "director" in section 8.50(2). But indemnification under section 8.56(3) must ultimately be "consistent with law." In effect, this leaves public
                        policy determinations as to what are permissible limits, in a particular case, to the courts. For example, in
                        <i>
        Koster v. Warren,
       </i> 297 F.2d 418, 423 (9th Cir. 1961), the court allowed indemnification of an officer and an employee, both of whom pleaded nolo contendere to an antitrust indictment at the corporation's request, the court reasoning that
                        they had foregone their personal right to defend for the corporation's benefit. On the other hand, the court indicated in dictum that an agreement in advance by the corporation to indemnify anyone convicted of antitrust violations
                        would be against public policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The broad grant of indemnification in section 8.56(3) may be limited by appropriate provisions in the articles of incorporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.56 provides that officers, employees, or agents who are also directors are subject to the same standards of indemnification as other directors. Consideration was given to whether these officer-directors, if acting in their capacity as an officer
                        but not as a director, should have the benefit of the additional flexibility afforded by section 8.56(3) for officers who are not directors. It was concluded, however, that all directors should be treated alike; complications may
                        be created if directors who are not officers have potentially less protection under the statute than directors who are officers. It would also be difficult in many instances to distinguish in what capacity an officer-director is
                        acting. Finally, this subchapter offers sufficient flexibility in indemnifying directors so that, as a practical matter, foreseeable problems for officer-directors can be handled within the statutory framework.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.56(1) grants nondirector officers the same mandatory rights to indemnification under section 8.52 (or to petition a court for indemnification under section 8.54) as are granted directors. Thus, the net effect of section 8.56 is to provide officers
                        with no less protection than is provided directors (including protection for service to third parties at the request of the corporation) and, additionally, to permit the corporation to provide broader indemnification for officers
                        who are not directors.

                        The words "who is not a director" appear after the words "of the corporation" in subdivisions 8.56(1) and (2) of the Model Act. The drafters omitted that language from the North Carolina version, without intending to change the meaning of the section,
                        because they believe the words were unnecessary and confusing. If an officer, employee or agent is also a director, his rights of indemnification in his capacity as director will be defined by the other sections and his indemnification
                        rights in his capacity as officer, employee or agent will be defined by this section. The addition of the unnecessary language in the Model Act might possibly be read as limiting a director's indemnification rights if he is also
                        an officer, which was not intended.

                        Section 8.57 authorizes a corporation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of directors, officers, employees, or agents against liabilities imposed on them by reason of actions in their official capacity or arising from their service to the corporation
                        or another entity at the corporation's request. Insurance is not limited to claims against which corporations are entitled to indemnify under this subchapter. This insurance, usually referred to as "D&O Liability Insurance," provides
                        a useful supplement to the rights of indemnification created by this subchapter, providing a source of reimbursement for corporations who indemnify directors and others for conduct covered by the insurance, and protecting the insureds
                        against the corporation's failure to pay indemnification required or permitted by this subchapter. On the other hand, policies do not cover uninsurable events like self-dealing, bad faith, knowing violations of the securities acts,
                        or other willful misconduct. See generally Johnston, "Corporate Indemnification and Liability Insurance," 33 BUS. LAW. 1993 (1978); Hinsey, "The New Lloyd's Policy Form for Directors and Officers' Liability Insurance - An Analysis,"

        AMENDED NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY
       </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.57 of the Model Act is entitled "Insurance" and deals only with that subject. In the North Carolina version the catchline has been expanded and the section is intended to permit broad nonstatutory indemnification completely in addition to and
                        notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-50ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-50(a)</a></cite> expressly states that purpose and declares it to be the public
                        policy of North Carolina.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section permits indemnification, insurance and reimbursement of expenses in addition to, and notwithstanding, any other provisions of this Chapter. The section embodies the public policy of this State set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-50ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-50(a)</a></cite>                        to permit a corporation organized under this Chapter to spread the risk of corporate management, notwithstanding any other general or special law of this State or of any other jurisdiction including the federal government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) permits and defines the scope of contractual indemnification under which the corporation, essentially as a self-insurer, may commit in advance to indemnify its directors, officers, employees or agents. This provision brings forward and
                        clarifies all of former G.S. 55-19(a), which was added by the 1986 amendments. It adds an express statement, for example, that a corporation may agree in advance to indemnify its personnel even in a corporate or derivative action,
                        subject only to the limitation brought forth from former G.S. 55-19(a).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Similarly, subsection (b) brings forward former G.S. 55-19(b) relating to the conflict of interest rules in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-31" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-31</a></cite> (which replaced former G.S. 55-30),
                        but the application of the subsection to indemnification plans adopted on or after July 1, 1990 has been limited to public corporations (i.e., those required to file reports under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).
                        This limitation to public corporations was considered appropriate because (1) former G.S. 55-19(b) was intended to deal with the need to attract qualified outside directors - a need experienced mainly by public corporations, (2)
                        shareholders of public corporations receive current disclosure of material changes in the indemnification scheme, and (3) shareholders have an active market in which they can dispose of their shares if they disapprove of a particular
                        scheme of indemnification. Subsection (b) does not prevent a shareholder from challenging indemnification in a particular case. Instead, its effect is to shift to the shareholder of a public corporation the burden of proving that
                        indemnification constitutes a breach of duty to the corporation under all of the facts and circumstances, including the facts and circumstances existing at the time indemnification was authorized or approved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (c) replaces former G.S. 55-19(c) with section 8.57 of the Model Act because the drafters concluded that these insurance provisions of the Model Act are broader and clearer than former G.S. 55-19(c). Subsection (c) applies whether or not a
                        corporation provides additional indemnification pursuant to subsections (a) and (b). As previously noted, former G.S. 55-19(d) was brought forward as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a08s55-8-53" target="_self">G.S. 55-8-53</a></cite>.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.58(a) provides that a provision treating the indemnification of directors by the corporation in articles of incorporation, bylaws, shareholders' or directors' resolution, or contract "is valid only if and to the extent it is consistent with"
                        this subchapter. Earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states provided that the statutory provisions were not "exclusive" and made no attempt to limit the nonstatutory creation of rights of indemnification.
                        This kind of language is subject to misconstruction, however, since nonstatutory conceptions of public policy limit the power of a corporation to indemnify or to contract to indemnify directors, officers, employees, or agents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The language of the first sentence of section 8.58(a), "to the extent it is consistent with this subchapter," is believed to be a more accurate description of the limited validity of nonstatutory indemnification provisions than the "nonexclusive" provisions
                        of earlier versions of the Model Act. It is important to recognize that "to the extent it is consistent with" is not synonymous with "exclusive." Situations may well develop from time to time in which indemnification is permissible
                        under section 8.58 but would be precluded if all portions of subchapter E were viewed as exclusive. But indemnification provisions protecting against the consequences of bad faith or willful misconduct are not consistent with this
                        subchapter and would not be valid. Furthermore, they would violate well-understood principles of public policy and doubtless would be invalidated on that ground even under statutes purporting to make "nonexclusive" the statutory
                        provisions for indemnification. To the extent the consistency language may preclude indemnification in circumstances where it is reasonable and violates no statutory policy, an escape valve is provided in section 8.55(2), which
                        authorizes a court to grant indemnification if a director "is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification in view of all the relevant circumstances," even though he may not have fully met the standards of conduct set forth
                        in section 8.51.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.58 does not preclude provisions in articles of incorporation, bylaws, resolutions, or contracts designed to provide procedural machinery different from that provided by section 8.55 or to make mandatory the permissive provisions of subchapter
                        E. For example, a corporation may properly obligate the board of directors to consider and act expeditiously on an application for indemnification or advances, or obligate the board of directors to cooperate in the procedural steps
                        required to obtain a judicial determination under section 8.54.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some corporations currently commit themselves, in one form or another, to indemnify directors to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. These commitments are consistent with subchapter E, subject to appropriate interpretation in light of the
                        facts and circumstances of the particular case. Furthermore, a commitment to maintain liability insurance for a director, pursuant to section 8.57, is consistent with this subchapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first sentence of section 8.58(a) applies only to directors; it does not apply to officers, employees, or agents who are not directors. See section 8.56 and its Official Comment. The inherent problems of conflict of interest and the need to encourage
                        persons to serve as directors are not present to the same degree in the case of nondirector officers, employees, or agents. The standard for permissible indemnification of these persons in section 8.56(3) is "consistent with law"
                        without regard to this subchapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 8.58(b) is designed to make clear that subchapter E deals only with directors who are actual or prospective defendants or respondents in a proceeding, and that expenses incurred in connection with appearance as a witness may be indemnified without
                        regard to the limitations of subchapter E. Indeed, most of the standards described in sections 8.51 and 8.54 by their own terms can have no meaningful application to a director whose only connection with a proceeding is that he
                        has been called as a witness.

                    Editor's Note. - Article 9, as set out in Session Laws 1989, ch. 265, is essentially former Article 7 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, as enacted by Session Laws 1987,
                    c. 88, s. 1. Amendments by Session Laws 1987, c. 124, ss. 1, 1.1 and 2 expired by the terms of that act on June 30, 1989. This article is not in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act, and there are no Official Comments or North

                    The present Article 9, as set out in Session Laws 1989, c. 265, differs from former Article 7 as it was on June 30, 1989, in the following particulars: (1) In <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a09s55-9-01" target="_self">G.S. 55-9-01</a></cite>,
                    the definition of "corporation" found in former G.S. 55-75 has expired and was not reenacted (see Session Laws 1987, c. 124, s. 1) and the definition of "other entity" has been amended by changing the first reference to "corporation"
                    to read "domestic or foreign corporation." (2) In <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a09s55-9-05" target="_self">G.S. 55-9-05</a></cite>, there are new opt-out provisions different from those of former G.S. 55-79. (3) Former G.S. 55-79.1
                    and 55-80, relating to conflict of laws and severability, expired and were not reenacted. (See Session Laws 1987, c. 124, ss. 1.1, 2.)

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2001-387, s. 154(b) provides that nothing in this act shall supersede the provisions of Article 10 or 65 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html" target="_blank">Chapter 58</a></cite> of the General Statutes,
                    and this act does not create an alternate means for an entity governed by Article 65 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html" target="_blank">Chapter 58</a></cite> of the General Statutes to convert to a different
                    business form.

                    Editor's Note. - Article 9A, as set out in Session Laws 1989, c. 265, is essentially former Article 7A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55</a></cite>, as enacted by Session Laws 1987,
                    c. 182, s. 1, and c. 773, s. 12, and amended by Session Laws 1989, c. 200. This article is not in the Revised Model Business Corporation Act, and there are no Official Comments or North Carolina Comments thereto.

                    The present Article 9A, as set out in Session Laws 1989, c. 265, differs from former Article 7A in three main respects. First, the term "issuing public corporation" was changed to "covered corporation." Second, former G.S. 55-98, dealing with the effect
                    of former Article 7A on former Article 7, was deleted. Third,
                    <span class="s1">
    §

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.01(a) authorizes a corporation to amend its articles of incorporation by adding a new provision to its articles of incorporation, modifying an existing provision, or deleting a provision in its entirety. The sole test for the validity of an
                        amendment is whether the provision could lawfully have been included in (or in the case of a deletion, omitted from) the original articles of incorporation as of the effective date of the amendment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The power of amendment must be exercised pursuant to the procedures set forth in the rest of this chapter, which require significant amendments to be approved either by a majority of the votes cast on the proposed amendment or by a majority of all of
                        the votes eligible to be cast on the proposed amendment (section 10.03). This majority vote requirement is supplemented by section 10.04, which establishes a right of voting by voting group on amendments that directly affect a
                        single class or series of shares, and by section 7.27, which treats amendments that change the voting requirements for future amendments.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.01(b) restates explicitly the policy embodied in earlier versions of the Model Act and in all modern state corporation statutes, that a shareholder "does not have a vested property right" in any provision of the articles of incorporation. Corporations
                        and their shareholders are also subject to amendments of the governing statute by the state under section 1.02.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.01(b) should be construed liberally and without qualification or restriction to achieve the fundamental purpose of this chapter of permitting corporate adjustment and change by majority vote. Section 10.01(b) rejects decisions by a few courts
                        that have applied a "vested rights" or "property right" doctrine to restrict or invalidate amendments to articles of incorporation because they modified particular rights conferred on shareholders by the original articles of incorporation.
                        These holdings are rejected because their effect often is to create a tyranny of the minority: the individual consent of each shareholder becomes necessary to adopt any important change, and each shareholder, no matter how small
                        his holding, can prevent the change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.01(b) does not change in any way the purpose of similar provisions in earlier versions of the Model Act, which included, along with general language similar to section 10.01(b), a long list of specific permissible amendments. This list was
                        designed to eliminate the last possible vestige of the "vested rights" theory by expressly referring to and validating all types of amendments to which a vested rights challenge could be made. Section 10.01(b) omits this "laundry
                        list" of permissible amendments as prolix and unnecessary to carry out the policies of the section. Examples of amendments that may be made under section 10.01 include:

                        A provision in the articles of incorporation is subject to amendment under section 10.01 even though the provision is described, referred to, or stated in a share certificate, information statement, or other document issued by the corporation that reflects
                        provisions of the articles of incorporation. The only exception to this unlimited power of amendment is section 6.27, which provides that share transfer restrictions may not be imposed by amendment on shares that were previously
                        issued without the consent of the holder.

                        Section 10.01 relates only to amendments to articles of incorporation. It does not relate to the impairment of obligations of a corporation to its shareholders based upon contracts independent of the articles of incorporation. An amendment permitted by
                        this section may constitute a breach of such a contract or of a contract between the shareholders themselves. A shareholder with contractual rights (or who otherwise is concerned about possible onerous amendments) may obtain complete
                        protection against these amendments only by establishing procedures in the articles of incorporation or bylaws that limit the power of amendment without his consent. In appropriate cases, a shareholder may be able to enjoin an
                        amendment that constitutes a breach of a contract.

                        Minority shareholders are protected from the power of the majority to impose onerous or objectionable amendments by two basic devices: the right to vote on amendments by separate voting groups (section 10.04) and the right to dissent under chapter 13.
                        In addition, courts have held that a decision by majority shareholders to exercise the powers granted by this section in a way that is arguably detrimental or unfair to minority interests may be examined by a court under its inherent
                        equity power to review transactions for good faith and fair dealing.

                    <p>
                        The amendments described in clauses (1) through (6) are so routine and "housekeeping" in nature as not to require action by shareholders. None affects substantive rights in any meaningful way. For example, section 10.02(1) authorizes amendments by the
                        board of directors to extend the duration of a corporation that was formed at a time when limited duration was required by law. The extension normally will be in the form of an amendment to delete all reference to the duration
                        of the corporation, which automatically makes the duration perpetual. See section 3.02. Similarly, sections 10.02(2) and (3) authorize the board of directors to delete the names of initial directors, or the name and address of
                        the initial registered agent and registered office, set forth in the original articles if that information is obsolete. Section 10.02(4) authorizes the board of directors to change each issued and unissued share of an outstanding
                        class of shares into a greater number of whole shares if the corporation has only that class of shares outstanding. All shares of the class being changed must be treated identically under this clause. Section 10.02(5) authorizes
                        minor name changes without shareholder approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.02(6) recognizes that other sections of the Model Act expressly permit other amendments to be made by the board of directors without prior shareholder approval. Examples of these include section 6.02 (creation of series of shares pursuant to
                        authority already granted in the articles) and section 6.31 (cancellation of reacquired shares if the articles provide they are not to be reissued).

                        Amendments provided for in this section may be included in restated articles of incorporation under section 10.07 or in articles of merger under chapter 11.

                        This section authorizes the board of directors to adopt certain "housekeeping" amendments to the articles of incorporation without shareholder action. Under former G.S. 55-100(b), shareholder action was required for all amendments after the initial issuance
                        of shares. Subdivision 10.02(1) of the Model Act, relating to an amendment to extend the duration of a corporation if it was incorporated at a time when limited duration was required by law, was omitted, because limited duration
                        has not been required by North Carolina law.

                    <p>
                        Significant amendments to articles of incorporation must be approved by the shareholders after being proposed by the board of directors. When proposing an amendment, the board of directors must make a recommendation to the shareholders that the amendment
                        be approved, unless it determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation. If the board of directors so determines, it must describe the conflict or circumstance, and
                        communicate the basis for its determination, when presenting the proposed amendment to the shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.03(c) codifies existing practice by expressly permitting the board of directors to submit an amendment to the shareholders on a conditional basis. This power of the board of directors does not alter the balance of power between the board of
                        directors and shareholders since the board of directors may always withhold its approval entirely and not submit an amendment. Examples of conditions commonly imposed are that the amendment not be approved unless (1) a favorable
                        vote by a specified proportion (larger than ordinarily required) of the shareholders is obtained, (2) no more than a specified fraction of the shareholders file written dissents, or (3) a class or series of shares must approve
                        the amendment as a separate voting group. These conditions may be used, for example, to discourage unwise depletion of corporate assets by the adoption of the amendment. The board of directors is not limited to conditions of these
                        types, however, and may condition the submission on any basis.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The vote of shareholders needed to approve an amendment depends in part on the voting groups entitled to vote separately on the amendment and in part on whether any of those voting groups would be entitled to dissenters' rights if the amendment were adopted.
                        See section 10.04. However, section 10.03(e) itself establishes a dual requirement for approval by shareholders of each voting group depending on the nature of the amendment: under section 7.25 and 7.26 a majority of the votes
                        cast affirmatively and negatively on the amendment at a meeting at which a quorum is present is necessary to approve most amendments; but if the amendment would give rise to dissenters' rights under chapter 13, section 10.03(e)
                        requires that it be approved by a majority of the votes of the outstanding shares of each voting group that will have dissenters' rights if the amendment were adopted, and by the vote required by sections 7.25 and 7.26 by other
                        voting groups that are entitled to vote on the amendment. This increased voting requirement reflects the importance of these proposals. Of course, the articles of incorporation may specify a greater quorum or voting requirement
                        for a voting group to approve an amendment of any type. See section 7.27.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The articles of incorporation or the board of directors may require that a proposed amendment be approved by a class or series of shares voting as a separate voting group; such a requirement may only be in addition to that otherwise required by section
                        10.04 of this Act.

                    <p>
                        This section continues the usual procedure under former G.S. 55-100(b) for adoption of amendments to the articles of incorporation by action of the board of directors and then by the shareholders. It adds two new features. First, the board of directors
                        must recommend the amendment to the shareholders, unless it determines that, because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances, it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its lack of a recommendation
                        to the shareholders. Second, the section specifically authorizes the board of directors to condition its submission of a proposed amendment "on any basis."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section omits the Model Act's requirement that notice of the meeting at which the proposed amendment will be considered and of the proposed amendment itself be given to all shareholders of the corporation whether or not entitled to vote on the proposed
                        amendment. Accordingly, the section continues the procedure under former G.S. 55-100(b)(2) of giving notice only to those shareholders entitled to vote on the proposed amendment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under former G.S. 55-100(b)(1), an amendment to the articles of incorporation could be initiated by shareholders entitled to call a shareholders' meeting. There is no similar procedure in this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A clarifying stylistic change was made to the Model Act's language in subsection (b) of this section.

                        Prior to this change, a board of directors was only required to propose amendments that required shareholder approval.

                    <p>
                        A class or series of shares is generally entitled to vote separately as a voting group on any amendment that affects the class or series in the manner described in subdivisions (1) through (9) of section 10.04(a). Shares are entitled to vote as separate
                        voting groups under this section even though they are designated as nonvoting shares in the articles of incorporation, or the articles of incorporation purport to deny them entirely the right to vote on the proposal in question,
                        or purport to allow other classes or series of shares to vote as part of the same voting group. See section 10.04(d). If an amendment would create dissenters' rights with respect to any class or series of shares, the amendment
                        must be approved by each voting group that would have dissenters' rights by a majority of all votes entitled to be cast on the amendment, and by other voting groups by the vote required by sections 7.25 and 7.26. See section 10.04(b).
                        All other amendments are subject to the voting requirements generally applicable to voting groups under sections 7.25 and 7.26.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right to vote by voting groups under section 10.04 is applicable only if "shareholder voting is otherwise required by this Act." An amendment that does not require shareholder approval, such as the creation of a new series of shares pursuant to authority
                        reserved in the original articles of incorporation (see section 6.02), does not trigger the right to vote by voting groups under this section.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right to vote as a separate voting group provides a major protection for classes or series of shares with preferential rights or classes or series of limited or nonvoting shares against amendments that are especially burdensome to that class. This
                        section, however, does not make the right to vote by separate voting group dependent on an evaluation of whether the amendment is detrimental to the class or series: if the amendment is one of those described in section 10.04(a),
                        the class or series is automatically entitled to vote as a separate voting group on the amendment. The question whether an amendment is detrimental is often a question of judgment, and approval by the affected class or series is
                        required, irrespective of whether the board or other shareholders believe it is beneficial or detrimental to the affected class or series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The nine types of changes that give rise to voting by voting groups are essentially the same as in earlier versions of the Model Act, though their number has been reduced based on the conclusion that some of the changes listed in earlier versions were
                        subsumed within other listed changes. Subsections (b) and (c) extend the privilege of voting by separate voting group to one or more series of a class of shares if the series has unique financial or voting provisions and is affected
                        in one or more of the ways described in subsection (a). These subsections must necessarily be phrased in general terms; any significant distinguishing feature of a series, which an amendment affects or alters, should trigger the
                        right of voting by separate voting group for that series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application of subsections (b) and (c) may best be illustrated by an example. Assume there is a class of shares with preferential rights comprised of three series, each with different preferential dividend rights. A proposed amendment would reduce
                        the rate of dividend applicable to the "Series A" shares and would change the dividend right of the "Series B" shares from a cumulative to a noncumulative right. The amendment would not affect the preferential dividend right of
                        the "Series C" shares. Both Series A and B would be entitled to vote as separate voting groups on the proposed amendment; the holders of the Series C shares, not directly affected by the amendment, would not be entitled to vote
                        at all unless the shares are otherwise voting shares under the articles of incorporation, in which case they would not vote as a separate voting group but in the voting group consisting of all shares with general voting rights
                        under the articles of incorporation. If the proposed amendment would reduce the dividend right of Series A and change the dividend right of both Series B and C from a cumulative to a noncumulative right, the holders of Series A
                        would be entitled to vote as a single voting group, and the holders of Series B and C would be required to vote together as a single, separate voting group.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 7.25 and 7.26 set forth the mechanics of voting by multiple voting groups.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.04(d) makes clear that the limited right to vote by separate voting groups provided by section 10.04 may not be narrowed or eliminated by the articles of incorporation. Even if a class or series of shares is described as "nonvoting" and the
                        articles purport to make that class or series nonvoting "for all purposes," that class or series nevertheless has the limited voting right provided by this section. Section 10.04(d) was included because of the ambiguity that would
                        normally arise whenever a class or series of nonvoting shares is created; no inference of any kind should be drawn from section 10.04(d) as to whether other, unrelated sections of the Model Act may be modified by the provisions
                        in the articles of incorporation.

                        This section differs from the Model Act in providing for class voting in the case of a proposed amendment to the articles of incorporation that would change the corporation into a nonprofit corporation or a cooperative organization. With this addition,
                        the instances in which class voting is required under the Act are the same as under former G.S. 55-101.

                        Section 10.05 provides that, before any shares are issued, amendments may be made by the persons empowered to complete the organization of the corporation. Under section 2.04 the organizers may, at the option of the corporation, be either the incorporators
                        or the initial directors named in the articles of incorporation. An amendment to the articles made at this stage of the formation process should involve a minimum of formality.

                        The articles of amendment must set forth both the amendment itself and the manner in which it was adopted. In the case of an amendment approved by shareholder vote (sections 10.03 and 10.04), the articles must state either the total vote in favor and
                        against the proposal or the undisputed vote for and a statement that this vote was sufficient to adopt the amendment. The latter tally method is permitted because in many situations the precise vote may depend on the resolution
                        of protracted disputes with respect to proxy votes. The filing of the articles of amendment should not be dependent on the resolution of every dispute if it is certain that a sufficient vote has been obtained without considering
                        the disputed votes. In most situations, of course, the precise vote can be readily determined, and when it can the articles should record it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.06(a)(3) requires the articles of amendment to contain a statement of the manner in which an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of issued shares is to be put into effect if not set forth in the amendment itself. This requirement avoids
                        any possible confusion that may arise as to how the amendment is to be put into effect and also permits the amendment itself to be limited to provisions of permanent applicability, with transitional provisions having no long-range
                        effect appearing only in the articles of amendment.

                        Restated articles of incorporation serve the useful purpose of permitting articles of incorporation that have been amended from time to time to be consolidated into a single document. Such a restatement may also eliminate "historical" or obsolete provisions
                        that have no present relevance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A restatement of articles of incorporation that does not involve any substantive change in the articles (or that makes only amendments that may be made by the board of directors without shareholder approval) may be approved by the board of directors alone.
                        In order to increase the reliability of restated articles as the definitive governing document of the corporation, section 10.07 authorizes the restated articles of incorporation to be submitted to the shareholders for approval
                        in the same manner as amendments to the articles. If duly submitted to the shareholders, substantive variation between the original articles of incorporation, as amended, and the restated articles becomes academic if the shareholders'
                        vote is the appropriate one required to amend the articles to the extent of the inconsistency.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Substantive amendments may also be adopted as part of a restatement. If substantive amendments are proposed, the same procedure must be followed as for the adoption of amendments under sections 10.02, 10.03, or 10.05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If restated articles are submitted to the shareholders, the notice of meeting should identify changes in the articles that may reasonably be viewed as more than mere changes of form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.07(e) makes it clear that the restated articles of incorporation supersede the original articles of incorporation and all amendments to them, and section 10.07(f) permits the secretary of state to certify the restatement uncluttered by the
                        information set forth in subsection (e).

                        This section is in substance the same as former G.S. 55-105. The procedure for simultaneously amending and restating the articles of incorporation was clarified. The Model Act uses two terms in its comparable section, "restated articles of incorporation"
                        and "restatement," to refer to the same document. Because the drafters concluded that the use of both could be confusing, they decided to use a single term, "restated articles of incorporation," and made other conforming and stylistic
                        changes in subsections (c), (d), and (f).

                        Effect of Amendments. - Session Laws 2005-268, s. 15, effective October 1, 2005, substituted "approval, to consolidate all amendments into a single document" for "action" in subsection (a); deleted former subsection (c) which read: "If the board of directors
                        submits restated articles of incorporation for shareholder action, the corporation shall notify each shareholder entitled to vote, of the proposed shareholders' meeting in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a07s55-7-05" target="_self">G.S. 55-7-05</a></cite>.
                        The notice must also (i) state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the proposed restated articles of incorporation, (ii) contain or be accompanied by a copy of the proposed restated articles
                        of incorporation, and (iii) identify any amendment or other change they would make in the articles"; rewrote subdivision (d)(3) and (d)(4); substituted "to the original articles of incorporation" for "to them" in subsection (e);
                        inserted "of this section" in subsection (f); and made minor stylistic changes throughout.

                        In the absence of a provision in the articles of incorporation, the power to amend or repeal bylaws is shared by the board of directors and shareholders. Amendment of bylaws by the board of directors is often simpler and more convenient than amendment
                        by the shareholders and avoids the expense of calling a shareholders' meeting, a cost that may be significant in publicly held corporations. As used in this subchapter, "amendment" includes the adoption of a bylaw on a new subject
                        as well as the alteration of existing bylaws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.20(a) provides, however, that the power to amend or repeal bylaws may be reserved exclusively to the shareholders by an appropriate provision in the articles of incorporation. This option may appropriately be elected by a closely held corporation
                        - for example, where control arrangements appear in the bylaws but one shareholder or group of shareholders has the power to name a majority of the board of directors. In such a corporation, the control arrangements may alternatively
                        be placed in the articles of incorporation rather than the bylaws if there is no objection to making them a matter of public record.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.20(a)(1) provides that the power to amend or repeal the bylaws may be reserved to the shareholders "in whole or part." This language permits the reservation of power to be limited to specific articles or sections of the bylaws or to specific
                        subjects or topics addressed in the bylaws. It is important that the areas reserved exclusively to the shareholders be delineated clearly and unambiguously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.20(a)(2) permits the shareholders to adopt or amend a bylaw and reserve exclusively to themselves the power to amend or repeal it later. This reservation must be expressed in the action by the shareholders adopting or amending the bylaw. This
                        option is also included for the benefit of closely held corporations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 10.20(b) states that the power of shareholders to amend or repeal bylaws exists even though that power is shared with the board of directors. This section makes inapplicable the holdings of a few cases under differently phrased statutes that shareholders
                        do not have a general or residual power to amend bylaws or that the power to amend bylaws may be vested exclusively in the board of directors. Under the Model Act the shareholders always have the power to amend or repeal the bylaws.

                    <p>
                        Sections 10.21 and 10.22 limit the power of directors to adopt or amend supermajority provisions in bylaws.

                        As modified, this section is consistent with former G.S. 55-16(a)(1).

                        Supermajority provisions relating to the board of directors may appear in the bylaws of the corporation without specific authorization in the articles of incorporation. See section 8.24(a) and (c). Like other bylaw provisions, they may be adopted either
                        by the board of directors or by the shareholders. See section 10.20. Such provisions, further, may be amended or repealed by the board of directors or shareholders as provided in this section. This treatment of supermajority provisions
                        for the board of directors should be contrasted with the treatment of analagous provisions for shareholders which must either be set forth in the articles of incorporation, section 7.27, or included in the bylaws when expressly
                        authorized by the articles, section 10.21, and their adoption, amendment, or repeal must be approved by the shareholders by the vote specified in sections 7.27 and 10.21.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Supermajority provisions relating to the board of directors are usually part of control arrangements in closely held corporations, and section 10.22 is designed with this end in view. Its basic purpose is to ensure that control arrangements negotiated
                        by shareholders for their own protection will not be prematurely terminated by a majority vote of the shareholders or the board of directors. Thus, section 10.22(a)(1) provides that if a supermajority requirement is originally
                        imposed by a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, only the shareholders may amend or repeal it. Further, under section 10.22(b), that bylaw may impose restrictions on the manner in which it may be thereafter amended or repealed by
                        the shareholders. On the other hand, if a supermajority requirement is originally imposed in a bylaw adopted by the board of directors, that bylaw may be amended either by the board of directors or shareholders (see section 10.22(a)(2)),
                        but if it is to be amended by the board of directors, section 10.22(c) requires approval by the supermajority requirement then being imposed or amended, whichever is greater. This requirement is analogous to that imposed on supermajority
                        amendments appearing in the articles of incorporation. See section 7.27. For an example of the application of this language, see the Official Comment to section 7.27.

                        Section 11.01(a) authorizes a statutory merger, to be accomplished by the adoption of a plan of merger under section 11.01(b), approval of the transaction by the shareholders (if required by section 11.03), and filing articles of merger under section
                        11.05. Upon the effective date of the merger, the surviving corporation becomes vested with all the assets of the disappearing corporations and becomes subject to their liabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the Model Act there are virtually no restrictions or limitations on the terms of a statutory merger. Shareholders of the disappearing corporations may receive securities of the surviving corporation, securities of a third corporation, e.g., shares
                        issued by the parent of the surviving or disappearing corporation (which may be publicly traded and marketable while the shares of the surviving or disappearing corporation are not), or cash or other property (a "cash" or "cash-out"
                        merger). Some of the holders of a single class of shares may be required to accept securities or properties while the remaining holders may be compelled to accept different securities, property, or cash. The capitalization of the
                        surviving corporation may be restructured in the merger, or its articles of incorporation may be amended by the articles of merger in any way deemed appropriate. Any other provisions considered necessary or desirable with respect
                        to the merger may be included in the plan of merger.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Merger transactions may give rise to voting by separate voting groups of shareholders under section 11.03(f), and dissenting shareholders may have dissenters' rights under chapter 13.

                    <p>
                        Courts have held that merger transactions that are formally authorized by the procedures set forth in this chapter may in some circumstances constitute a breach of duty to minority shareholders where the effect of the transaction is to eliminate them
                        from further equity participation in the enterprise. See McBride, "Delaware Corporate Law: Judicial Scrutiny of Mergers - The Aftermath of
                        <i>

        Magnavox Co.
       </i> ," 33 BUS. LAW. 2231 (1978). In Delaware, case law establishes that these transactions must be fully disclosed and entirely fair to the minority shareholders. See

                        A transaction may have the same economic effect as a statutory merger even though it is cast in the form of a nonstatutory transaction. For example, assets of the disappearing corporations may be sold for consideration in the form of shares of the surviving
                        corporation, followed by the distribution of those shares by the disappearing corporations to their shareholders and their subsequent dissolution. Transactions have sometimes been structured in nonstatutory form for tax reasons
                        or in an effort to avoid some of the consequences of a statutory merger, particularly appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders. Faced with these transactions, a few courts have developed or accepted the "de facto merger" concept
                        which, to some uncertain extent, grants to dissenting shareholders the rights they would have had if the transaction had been structured as a statutory merger. See Folk, "De Facto Mergers in Delaware:

        REVISED NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY 2018
       </b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Article 11 eliminates all references to statutory consolidation because of the infrequent use of the consolidation form of combination, in which all corporate parties to the combination disappear and an entirely new corporation is created, and because,
                        if a new entity is desirable, it may be created before the merger and the disappearing entities may merge into it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The third sentence of the second paragraph of the "Official Comment" to Section 11.01 of the Model Act indicates that a plan of merger can discriminate among holders of shares of the same class in the kind of property they receive in a merger. The drafters
                        believed that this sentence does not reflect the current law in North Carolina. They believed that the current law does not permit discrimination among the holders of shares of a single class that are similarly situated in the
                        kind of property that can be received in a merger; all the shares of a single class must be treated the same, both in value and kind, for similarly situated shareholders. Therefore, the drafters note their disagreement with this
                        sentence in the "Official Comment." But see <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a06s55-6-24ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 55-6-24(b)</a></cite> (which expressly permits discrimination among holders of a single class
                        or series of shares in certain shareholder rights plans).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are circumstances where shares of a single class are not similarly situated. For example, Corporation A and/r its wholly-owned subsidiaries may own a portion of the shares of common stock of Corporation B, while the remaining shares of common stock
                        of Corporation B are owned by a number of other holders. Corporation A and Corporation B may wish to engage in a merger transaction, pursuant to which Corporation A will acquire all of the shares of Corporation B not already owned
                        by Corporation A and/r its wholly-owned subsidiaries (for example in a triangular merger) and the other holders of Corporation B shares will receive a specified merger consideration for their shares. Under such circumstances, Corporation
                        A (and its wholly-owned subsidiaries) and the other holders of Corporation B stock are not similarly situated and there is no reason for them to be treated the same, so long as all of the other holders are treated equally and do
                        not receive merger consideration that is of lesser value than any received by Corporation A or its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Accordingly, under such circumstances, the plan of merger should properly be able to provide that the
                        shares of Corporation B held by Corporation A and its wholly-owned subsidiaries may be cancelled (and Corporation A and its wholly-owned subsidiaries not receive any merger consideration for such shares) and that the shares held
                        by the other holders of Corporation B shares may receive the specified merger consideration.

                        This section is not intended to change the current law in North Carolina under which shareholders may elect to receive alternative forms of consideration (e.g. cash or shares) and proration is provided if one of the alternatives is oversubscribed.

                    <p>
                        Section 11.02 establishes a procedure by which a direct exchange of shares for cash or other consideration in corporate combinations may be effected under the same safeguards applicable to statutory mergers or similar transactions. A share exchange under
                        section 11.02 is binding upon all shareholders of the acquired class or series of shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is often desirable to effect a reorganization or combination so that the corporation being acquired does not go out of existence but becomes a subsidiary of the acquiring corporation or holding company, the securities of which are issued as part of
                        the transaction. These objectives often are particularly important in the formation of holding company systems for, or for the acquisition of, insurance companies and banks, but are not limited to these transactions. In the absence
                        of a share exchange procedure, this kind of a transaction often may be accomplished only by the process of a "reverse triangular merger": the formation of a new subsidiary of the acquiring or holding company, followed by a merger
                        of that subsidiary into the corporation to be acquired in which securities of the new subsidiary's parent are exchanged for securities of the corporation to be acquired. Section 11.02 provides a straightforward procedure to accomplish
                        the same end.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 11.02, all shares of a particular class or series of shares must be acquired. However, shares of one or more classes or series may be excluded from the plan or may be included on different bases. After the plan is adopted and approved by
                        the shareholders as required by section 11.03, it is binding on all holders of shares of the class or series to be acquired; members of the class or series, however, have the right to dissent under chapter 13.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not necessary that a share exchange under section 11.02 be on a share-for-share basis. The consideration for the shares being acquired may be "shares, obligations, or other securities of the acquiring or any other corporation or . . . cash or other
                        property in whole or part."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.02(c) is designed to make it clear that the mandatory exchange provided by section 11.02 does not affect the power of corporations to acquire shares by voluntary exchange or otherwise by agreement with the shareholders.

                        This section introduces a concept that is new to North Carolina, i.e., a share exchange, which is defined as a transaction by which a corporation becomes the owner of all the outstanding shares of one or more classes of another corporation by an exchange
                        that is compulsory on all owners of the acquired shares.

                    <p>
                        The same kind of transaction that is accomplished by a share exchange has in the past been accomplished by the process of a "reverse triangular merger," which is the formation of a new subsidiary of the acquiring company, followed by a merger of that
                        subsidiary into the corporation to be acquired in which the securities of the new subsidiary's parent are exchanged for securities of the corporation to be acquired.

                        Section 11.03 requires the board of directors to propose the plan of merger or sale exchange and then submit the proposal to the shareholders. When proposing a plan of merger or share exchange, the board of directors must make a recommendation to the
                        shareholders that the plan be approved, unless it determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation. If the board of directors so determines, it must describe the conflict
                        or circumstances, and communicate the basis for its determination, when presenting the proposed plan of merger or share exchange to the shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.03(c) permits the board of directors to condition its submission of a plan of merger or share exchange on any basis; for example, the board may direct that the plan is approved only if it receives a favorable vote of a specified percentage
                        of the disinterested shareholders voting on the plan or that shareholders holding no more than a specified number or percentage of shares file notice of intent to demand payment under chapter 13. See the discussion of conditional
                        submissions in the Official Comment to section 10.03.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A plan of merger or share exchange, to be approved, must be approved by each voting group entitled to vote on the merger by a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast on the plan. This is a greater vote than that required for ordinary matters under
                        section 7.25. The articles of incorporation of either corporation, however, may require a greater vote by one or more voting groups of that corporation, and if the transaction involves an amendment to the articles of incorporation
                        of the surviving corporation which affects the voting requirements for future amendments, the transaction must also be approved by the vote required by section 7.27. See section 11.03(e). In addition, voting by more than one voting
                        group may be required by section 11.03(f) or by the articles of incorporation. Finally, the board of directors may require a greater vote or a vote by voting groups under their power to make conditional submissions to shareholders
                        described above. The articles of incorporation or the board of directors, however, may only require a vote by separate voting groups in addition to that otherwise required by this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only shareholders who have the right to vote on a merger or share exchange under section 11.03 have the right to dissent and obtain payment for their shares under chapter 13.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.03(g) describes when approval by the shareholders of the surviving corporation is not required. The theory behind this subsection is that shareholders' votes should be required only if the transaction fundamentally alters the character of the
                        enterprise or substantially reduces the shareholders' participation in voting or profit distribution. It is believed that the transactions for which shareholder approval is not required by subsection (g) do not alter the investors'
                        prospects any more than many other management decisions, and thus should not require a shareholder vote. In particular, the 20 percent requirement of subsections (g)(3) and (4) is broadly consistent with the statutes of several
                        states, including Delaware (20 percent), Michigan (20 percent), and Pennsylvania (15 percent), and also with the New York Stock Exchange requirement that shareholders must be consulted if the number of outstanding shares is to
                        be increased by more than 18.5 percent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The requirement that shareholders of the surviving corporation in a statutory merger have a right to vote if the increase in the number of shares exceeds 20 percent may be avoided by arranging the transaction in the form of a merger involving a subsidiary
                        of the acquiring corporation or as a share exchange under section 11.02. This anomaly reflects a compromise among basically conflicting points of view.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The 20 percent requirement is applicable only if the corporation has available enough authorized shares to permit it to issue the shares without amending its articles of incorporation to increase authorized capital. If it must amend its articles of incorporation
                        to authorize the shares necessary to complete the transaction, a shareholder vote on the amendment will be necessary in all cases. See section 10.03.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.03(f)(1) requires voting by voting groups on a plan of merger if the plan contains a provision that "if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by one or more separate voting groups on the proposed
                        amendment." See section 10.04. Under this provision, voting by voting groups may be required for one or more classes or series of shares of the surviving corporation as well as for one or more classes or series of the disappearing
                        corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.03(f)(2) requires voting by voting groups in a share exchange, with each class or series of shares that is to be acquired in a share exchange entitled to vote as a separate voting group. This provision protects all classes of shareholders when
                        more than one class or series of shares are being acquired on different terms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a merger transaction that involves an increase in shares of more than 20 percent, section 11.03(g) requires a shareholder vote in order to prevent significant dilution without the approval of the shareholders involved. Sections 11.03(g)(3) and (4)
                        separately apply the 20-percent test to increases in the "voting shares" (as defined in section 11.03(h)(2)) and increases in "participating shares" (as defined in section 11.03(h)(1)). If either type of shares is increased by
                        more than 20 percent in the merger transaction, the transaction must be approved by the shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the definitions in subsections (h)(1) and (2), the 20-percent requirement may be applied to shares with preferential rights if they are either voting or fully participating, and to deferred or contingent shares issued as a result of the merger.
                        On the other hand, it is typically not applicable to shares issuable under antidilution clauses to balance share splits or share dividends; these shares would not become issuable "pursuant to the merger," but by virtue of later
                        corporate action authorizing the split or dividend.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 11.03(g)(3) and (4) only determine when a shareholders' vote is required; they do not relate to voting by voting groups. Whether or not a class or series of shares is entitled to vote as a separate voting group is determined by section 11.03(f).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.03(i) makes it clear that the corporations may abandon without shareholder approval a merger or share exchange even though it has been previously approved by the shareholders. Abandonment under this section does not affect contract rights of
                        third parties. The plan, however, may require that abandonments be approved by shareholders before they are effective.

                    <p>
                        This section essentially follows the same pattern as former G.S. 55-108 and 55-108.1, except it does not carry forward the provision in former G.S. 55-108(b) allowing nonvoting shareholders to vote on mergers. However, the corporation must give nonvoting
                        shareholders notice of the proposed shareholders' meeting so that they can act if their rights will be adversely affected. The Model Act's requirement that notice be given to nonvoting shareholders was retained in this section,
                        in contrast to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a10s55-10-03" target="_self">G.S. 55-10-03</a></cite>, involving shareholders' meetings to consider amendments to the articles of incorporation, because a proposed
                        merger or share exchange is a fundamental change, whereas most amendments to the articles of incorporation are not. It should be noted that the last sentence in the first section of the Official Comment is not correct for this
                        Act. That sentence indicates that nonvoting shareholders have no right to dissent and obtain payment for their shares in a merger or share exchange. <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a13s55-13-02ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 55-13-02(a)(1)</a></cite>                        and (2) give nonvoting shareholders this right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to conform to changes made in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a10s55-10-03" target="_self">G.S. 55-10-03</a></cite>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (e) by inserting between the word "incorporation" and the word "or" the words "a bylaw adopted by the shareholders." This modification continues the existing concept of allowing a bylaw adopted by the shareholders
                        to impose a higher quorum or voting requirement. The subsection was further amended by inserting at the end a clause providing that for purposes of Article 9 or already existing provisions in articles of incorporation or bylaws,
                        a "merger" includes a share exchange.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subdivision 11.03(f)(1) of the Model Act requires voting by voting groups on a plan of merger if the plan contains a provision that "if contained in a proposed amendment to articles of incorporation, would require action by one or more separate voting
                        groups on the proposed amendment." Under this provision, voting by voting groups may be required for one or more classes or series of shares of the surviving corporation as well as for one or more classes or series of the disappearing
                        corporation. This provision was modified in subdivision (f)(1) to create an exception where the consideration to be received in exchange for the shares of the voting group consists solely of cash.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subdivision (f)(2) by substituting "to be acquired" for "included."

                        and (iii) to allow a plan of merger to be amended if the plan of merger makes provision for amendment.

                        Subsections (a) and (b) were amended and subsections (j) and (k) were added, effective October 1, 2018, to permit a public company target to enter into a "two-step" merger agreement, where the first step is a tender offer by the acquiror for the public
                        company shares and the second step is a merger in which the public company shares not tendered are converted into the same merger consideration offered in the tender offer. The provisions are based on 2016 changes to Model Act
                        Subsections 11.04(b) and (j). Appraisal rights generally would not be available with respect to a merger involving public company shares pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a13s55-13-02ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 55-13-02(b)(1)</a></cite>,
                        but if the transaction was an interested transaction, appraisal rights would be available pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a13s55-13-02ol1b4" target="_self">G.S. 55-13-02(b)(4)</a></cite>. Under the "two-step" merger
                        agreement procedure, shareholders who do not tender their shares would have the same rights to seek appraisal under Article 13 of this Chapter that they would in a merger that was approved at a meeting of shareholders.

                        Board of directors of a bank was not required to submit a share exchange to the shareholders for a vote when the bank merged with another bank because the transaction was not compulsory on any owners of the acquired shares as they were issued directly
                        to the other bank. There were no prior-owners of the acquired shares, and the other bank provided consideration to the bank in the form of the other bank's shares. Ehrenhaus v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite>                        59, 717 S.E.2d 9 (2011).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    <p>
                        Section 11.04(a) defines a "parent" corporation as one that owns at least 90 percent of the outstanding shares of each class of another corporation, and a "subsidiary" corporation as one whose shares are so owned. Section 11.04 permits merger of a subsidiary
                        into its parent corporation upon adoption of a plan of merger by the board of directors of the parent alone. Separate action by the board of directors of the subsidiary is unnecessary because the share ownership of the parent corporation
                        is normally sufficient to permit it to elect or remove the subsidiary's board of directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Further, the merger transaction need not be approved by the shareholders of either corporation. Approval by the shareholders of the subsidiary is meaningless because the parent's share ownership is sufficient to ensure the plan will be approved. Approval
                        by the parent's shareholders is also unnecessary because the transaction does not materially change their rights: the ownership of the parent corporation is being changed only from 90 percent indirect ownership to 100 percent direct
                        ownership of the same assets, and no significant amendment of the parent's articles of incorporation is being made. For the same reason, shareholders of the parent corporation do not have the right to dissent from the transaction
                        under chapter 13.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Minority shareholders of the subsidiary corporation may receive shares, obligations, or other securities of the parent or any other corporation, or cash or other property in whole or in part in exchange for their shares. These shareholders are entitled
                        to 30 days' notice of the plan of merger before it is effectuated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shareholders of the subsidiary corporation have a right to dissent from the merger transaction under chapter 13. Courts have held that in some circumstances such a transaction may constitute a breach of duty owed by the parent corporation to the shareholders
                        of the subsidiary. See

                        This section is substantially different from former G.S. 55-108.1 in that it permits a parent corporation to merge a 90% subsidiary into the parent without a vote of the minority shareholders of the subsidiary; but such minority shareholders would still
                        have a right of dissent and appraisal.

                        the merger be given to the subsidiary corporation's shareholders (if the shareholders are not required to approve the merger) within ten days after the merger instead of providing notice at least 30 days before the merger.

                        Effective October 1, 2005, this section is amended to delete the requirement that the plan of merger or plan of share exchange be included in the articles of merger or articles of share exchange except that identifying information about the corporations
                        contained in the plan is required to be included in the articles plus, in the case of a merger, any amendments to the articles of incorporation of a surviving domestic corporation that are contained in the plan of merger. Other
                        changes to this section clarify its application to mergers of domestic nonprofit corporations, foreign business corporations, and foreign nonprofit corporations with domestic business corporations and to share exchanges with foreign
                        business corporations. In related changes, provisions requiring certain statements to be included in the articles of merger when a foreign business corporation or foreign nonprofit corporation is the surviving corporation are relocated

                    <p>
                        Section 11.06 describes the legal consequences of a merger or share exchange on its effective date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.06(a) describes the effect of a merger. On the effective date every disappearing corporation that is a party to the merger disappears into the surviving corporation and the surviving corporation automatically becomes the owner of all real and
                        personal property and becomes subject to all liabilities, actual or contingent, of each disappearing corporation. A merger is not a conveyance or transfer, and does not give rise to claims of reverter or impairment of title based
                        on a prohibited conveyance or transfer. See section 11.06(a)(2). Further, all pending litigation is continued; the name of the surviving corporation may, but need not be, substituted for the name of a disappearing corporation that
                        is a party to litigation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.06(a)(6) provides that if any shareholders to any party to the merger are to receive different shares or cash or property under the plan of merger, the rights of those shareholders after the articles of merger are filed are limited to their
                        rights under the plan of merger or their rights under chapter 13 of this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The articles of incorporation of the surviving corporation are amended as provided in the plan of merger on the effective date of the merger. See section 11.06(a)(5).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 11.06(b) describes the effect of a share exchange. On the effective date, the shareholders of the acquired class of shares cease to be shareholders of the acquired corporation. On that date they are entitled to receive only the consideration provided
                        in the plan of share exchange, or the rights of dissenting shareholders under chapter 13.

                        This section is identical to the comparable section of the Model Act, except for a minor modification to subdivision (a)(6). "Cash" in that subdivision was changed to "right to receive cash" and the word "thereupon" was added to clarify the meaning.

                        Effective October 1, 2005, this section is changed to provide that any amendments to the articles of incorporation of a surviving domestic corporation must be set forth in the articles of merger because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a11s55-11-05" target="_self">G.S. 55-11-05</a></cite>                        (as amended effective October 1, 2005) no longer requires the plan of merger to be included in the articles of merger. A provision is added stating that the merger does not affect the liability of a shareholder for obligations
                        of a merging corporation incurred prior to the merger. Other amendments to this section clarify its application to mergers of domestic nonprofit corporations, foreign business corporations, and foreign nonprofit corporations with
                        domestic business corporations and to share exchanges with foreign business corporations. In related changes, provisions applying when the surviving corporation in a merger is a foreign business corporation or foreign nonprofit
                        corporation are relocated to this section from <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a11s55-11-07" target="_self">G.S. 55-11-07</a></cite> and 55-11-09, and provisions applying when the acquiring corporation in a share exchange is a
                        foreign business corporation are relocated to this section from <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a11s55-11-07" target="_self">G.S. 55-11-07</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        Section 11.07 permits mergers or share exchanges between domestic and foreign corporations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In connection with a plan of merger, the plan must be permitted under the law of the state or country of incorporation of the foreign corporation as well as under the law of the domestic state. The surviving corporation, if it is a foreign corporation,
                        must file articles of merger to accomplish the disappearance of the domestic corporation or corporations, and thereby irrevocably appoints the secretary of state as agent for service of process and agrees to pay dissenters in accordance
                        with chapter 13.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A plan of share exchange, unlike a plan of merger, need not be authorized by the state or country of incorporation of the acquiring foreign corporation. If the domestic law authorizes a compulsory share exchange to acquire a class or series of shares
                        of a domestic corporation, it makes no difference whether the acquiring corporation is foreign or domestic. This kind of transaction does not affect the separate corporate existence of, or impose the liabilities of the disappearing
                        corporation on, the acquiring foreign corporation.
                    </p>

                        Effective October 1, 2005, this section is amended to provide that if the corporation whose shares are to be acquired in a share exchange is a foreign business corporation, the laws of the state or country of incorporation of the foreign business corporation
                        must permit the share exchange and both the foreign business corporation and the acquiring domestic business corporation must comply with those laws. In the case of a merger involving a foreign business corporation, the merging
                        domestic business corporation must comply with the laws of the state or country of incorporation of the merging foreign business corporation to the extent applicable in addition to the merging foreign business corporation complying
                        with those laws. Other amendments reflect the relocation to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a11s55-11-05" target="_self">G.S. 55-11-05</a></cite> and 55-11-06 from this section of certain provisions applying

       NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY
      </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, the general rule is that a North Carolina corporation may merge with another corporation upon approval by the boards of directors and shareholders of each constituent corporation. However, where a parent
                    corporation holds at least 90% of each class of outstanding stock of a subsidiary corporation, the parent corporation and subsidiary corporation may merge without a vote of the board of directors or shareholders of the subsidiary and,
                    where the parent is the surviving corporation of the merger and its articles of incorporation are not being amended in connection with the merger, without a vote of the shareholders of the parent corporation. This simplified merger
                    approval process for 90% or more owned subsidiaries permitted by the North Carolina Business Corporation Act is commonly referred to as a "Short-Form Merger." This section was added, effective as of October 1, 2018, to extend the Short-Form
                    Merger process to any type of parent business entity.

                        A sale of "all or substantially all" the corporate assets in the regular course of business is governed by section 12.01. Mortgages of all of the corporation's assets or redeployment of those assets through a wholly owned subsidiary are also covered by
                        section 12.01. All other sales of "all or substantially all" the corporate assets are governed by section 12.02. Dispositions or transfers of property that do not involve "all or substantially all" the property of the corporation
                        are not controlled by statute and may be approved by the board of directors (or authorized corporate officer) in the same manner as any other corporate transaction.

                        The phrase "all or substantially all," chosen by the draftsmen of the Model Act, is intended to mean what it literally says, "all or substantially all." The phrase "substantially all" is synonymous with "nearly all" and was added merely to make it clear
                        that the statutory requirements could not be avoided by retention of some minimal or nominal residue of the original assets. A sale of all the corporate assets other than cash or cash equivalents is normally the sale of "all or
                        substantially all" of the corporation's property. A sale of several distinct manufacturing lines while retaining one or more lines is normally not a sale of "all or substantially all" even though the lines being sold are substantial
                        and include a significant fraction of the corporation's former business. If the lines retained are viewed only as a temporary operation or as a pretext to avoid the "all or substantially all" requirements, however, the statutory
                        requirements of chapter 12 must be complied with. Similarly, a sale of a plant but retention of operating assets (e.g., machinery and equipment), accounts receivable, good will, and the like with a view toward continuing the operation
                        at another location is not a sale of "all or substantially all" the corporation's property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some court decisions have adopted a narrower construction of somewhat similar statutory language. These decisions should be viewed as resting on the diverse statutory language involved in those cases and should not be viewed as illustrating the meaning
                        of "all or substantially all" intended by the draftsmen of the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 12.01 describes transfers or dispositions of "all or substantially all" the corporate assets that do not require shareholder approval unless the articles of incorporation require it. These transactions consist of (1) mortgages or pledges of all
                        the corporation's property, whether or not the loan they secure is in the ordinary course of business, (2) transactions within the usual and regular course of business, and (3) transfers to wholly owned subsidiaries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mortgages or pledges of all the corporate assets may be demanded by lenders. They are essentially and substantively different from a sale or other disposition of assets even though they may take the form of a formal transfer of title to the mortgagee
                        for security purposes, or of a dedication of assets to the repayment of indebtedness, as in the case of oil and gas production payments. The corporation remains in possession of the mortgaged property, may continue to use it for
                        corporate purposes, in most cases must continue to manage the property, and may recover full title to the property by discharging the indebtedness.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most transfers of "all or substantially all" the corporate property (as defined above) are, almost by definition, not in the usual and regular course of business; sales by real estate corporations and by corporations organized to liquidate a business
                        are examples of sales that may be included in this part of section 12.01(a). Typically, sales falling within the usual and regular course of business do not involve the sale of the corporate name or good will.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 12.01 provides that a transfer of property to a wholly owned subsidiary does not require a vote of shareholders. This provision, however, may not be used as a device to avoid a vote of shareholders by a multiple-step transaction.

                        Subsection (a) is identical to former G.S. 55-112(a) and was substituted for the comparable provision in the Model Act (subdivision 12.01(a)(2)) to avoid an unintended implication that all mortgages or security interests require express approval by the
                        board of directors. Subsection (b) consists of subsection 12.01(a) of the Model Act, except for an introductory phrase taken from former G.S. 55-112(b) and the omission of the Model Act's subdivision 12.01(a)(2). Because the Model
                        Act's subsection 12.02(b) serves the same function as the language taken from former G.S. 55-112(b), that subsection was omitted.

                    <p>
                        The scope of the phrase "all or substantially all" is discussed in the Official Comment to section 12.01. All transactions that involve the sale or transfer of "all or substantially all" the corporate property must be approved by the shareholders unless
                        they fall within one of the exceptions of section 12.01.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 12.02 requires the board of directors to propose the sale and then submit the proposal to the shareholders. The board of directors must make a recommendation to the shareholders that the transaction be approved, unless the board determines that
                        because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation. If the board so determines, it must describe the conflict or circumstances, and communicate the basis for its determination, to the
                        shareholders when it presents the proposed sale.

                        The proposed sale, to be approved, must receive the vote of a majority of the outstanding votes entitled by the articles of incorporation to be cast on the proposal. This is a greater vote than that required for ordinary matters under section 7.25. Nonvoting
                        classes of shares are not given a statutory right to vote on proposed sales (either as separate voting groups or together with voting shares) by the revised Model Act on the theory that classes or series of shares that are made
                        nonvoting by the articles of incorporation generally did not retain a voice in the areas of business the corporation may engage in the future. The articles of incorporation, however, may stipulate that specified classes or series
                        of shares are entitled to vote by separate voting groups. Thus, in the absence of special provision in the articles of incorporation, only the shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally by the articles of incorporation
                        are entitled to vote on sales of substantially all the assets of the corporation. The articles of incorporation may also specify that a greater percentage of votes is required to approve the proposal than specified in section 12.02.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The board of directors may condition its submission of a proposal to the shareholders under subsection (c) on any basis - for example, on its receiving a certain percentage of shareholders' affirmative votes or that specified classes or series of shares,
                        voting by separate voting groups, must approve the transaction or on some other basis; see the discussion of conditional submissions in the Official Comment to section 10.03.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The approval of most sales of "all or substantially all" of the corporation's assets gives rise to dissenters' rights under chapter 13 to shareholders who are entitled to vote on the transaction and avail themselves of the procedures described in that
                        chapter. Sales subject to section 12.02 that do not give rise to dissenters' rights even for voting shares include (1) sales pursuant to a court order and (2) sales that require all or substantially all of the net proceeds to be
                        distributed to the shareholders in accordance with their respective interests within one year after the date of sale. See section 13.02. Shares not entitled to vote on the transaction do not have dissenters' rights by statute;
                        the articles of incorporation may grant those rights or the board of directors may elect to make them available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 12.02(f) authorizes a board of directors to abandon a proposed sale without shareholder approval after it has been previously approved by the shareholders. An abandonment does not affect contractual rights that third persons may have against the
                        corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain corporate divisions, often called "spin offs," "split offs," or "split ups," sometimes involve transactions that may be formally characterized as sales of "all or substantially all" the corporate assets when in fact they are only a step in a corporate
                        division that does not give rise to the problem of a major change in corporate direction and therefore does not need shareholder approval. Section 12.02(g) is designed to make clear that transactions like this, which actually constitute
                        a distribution, are not subject to section 12.02. See Siegal, "When Corporations Divide: A Statutory and Financial Analysis," 79 HARV. L. REV. 534 (1966).

                        Article 12 changes the former law by requiring a simple majority of the shares entitled to vote instead of a two-thirds majority of all shares outstanding, whether or not otherwise entitled to vote, for the sale of substantially all of the assets of a
                        corporation.

                        The Model Act's subsection 12.02(a) provides that a corporation may sell, lease, exchange, or otherwise dispose of all, or substantially all, of its property "(with or without the good will)." Because the drafters believed that the language in parentheses
                        is unclear and probably adds nothing to the subsection, it was not included in subsection (a).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to conform to changes made in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a10s55-10-03" target="_self">G.S. 55-10-03</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        The phrase "a bylaw adopted by the shareholders" was inserted in subsection (e) to preserve the practice under prior law.

       </b> - Session Laws 2013-153, s. 13, effective January 1, 2014, rewrote the section heading, which formerly read "Sale of assets other than in regular course of business"; substituted "The following requirements shall be
                        met for" for "For" in subsection (b); rewrote subdivision (b)(1), which formerly read "The board of directors must recommend the proposed transaction to the shareholders unless the board of directors determines that because of
                        conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation, in which event the board of directors must communicate the basis for its lack of recommendation to the shareholders with the submission of the

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> deals with the tension between the desire of the corporate leadership to be able to enter new fields, acquire new enterprises, and rearrange
                        investor rights, and the desire of investors to adhere to the rights and the risks on the basis of which they invested. Contemporary corporation statutes in the United States attempt to resolve this tension through a combination
                        of two devices. On the one hand, through their approval of an amendment to the articles of incorporation, a merger, share exchange or disposition of assets, the majority may change the nature and shape of the enterprise and the
                        rights of all its shareholders. On the other hand, shareholders who object to these changes may withdraw the fair value of their investment in cash through their exercise of appraisal rights.

                    <p>
                        The traditional accommodation has been sharply criticized from two directions. From the viewpoint of investors who object to the transaction, the appraisal process is criticized for providing little help to the ordinary investor because its technicalities
                        make its use difficult, expensive, and risky. From the viewpoint of the corporate leadership, the appraisal process is criticized because it fails to protect the corporation from demands that are motivated by the hope of a nuisance
                        settlement or by fanciful conceptions of value. See generally Bayless Manning, "The Shareholders' Appraisal Remedy: An Essay for Frank Coker," 72

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> is a compromise between these opposing points of view. It is designed to increase the frequency with which assertion of appraisal rights
                        leads to economical and satisfying solutions, and to decrease the frequency with which such assertion leads to delay, expense, and dissatisfaction. It seeks to achieve these goals primarily by simplifying and clarifying the appraisal
                        process, as well as by motivating the parties to settle their differences in private negotiations without resort to judicial appraisal proceedings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> proceeds from the premise that judicial appraisal should be provided by statute only when two conditions co-exist. First, the proposed
                        corporate action as approved by the majority will result in a fundamental change in the shares to be affected by the action. Second, uncertainty concerning the fair value of the affected shares may cause reasonable persons to differ
                        about the fairness of the terms of the corporate action. Uncertainty is greatly reduced, however, in the case of publicly-traded shares. This explains both the market exception described below and the limits provided to the exception.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Appraisal rights in connection with mergers and share exchanges under chapter 11 and dispositions of assets requiring shareholder approval under chapter 12 are provided when these two conditions co-exist. Each of these actions will result in a fundamental
                        change in the shares that a disapproving shareholder may feel was not adequately compensated by the terms approved by the majority. Except for shareholders of a subsidiary corporation that is merged under section 11.05 (the "short-form"
                        merger), only those shareholders who are entitled to vote on a transaction are entitled to appraisal rights. The linkage between voting and appraisal rights is justified because the right to a shareholder vote is a good proxy for
                        assessing the seriousness of the change contemplated by the corporate action. This is especially true where the action triggers group-voting provisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Notwithstanding this linkage, amended chapter 13 eliminates appraisal for voting shareholders in several instances where it would have been available under the 1984 Act. Shareholders who are entitled to vote on a corporate action, whether because such
                        shareholders have general voting rights or because group voting provisions are triggered, are not entitled to appraisal if the change will not alter the terms of the class or series of securities that they hold. Thus, statutory
                        appraisal rights are not available for shares of any class of the surviving corporation in a merger or any class of shares that is not included in a share exchange. Appraisal is also not triggered by a voluntary dissolution under
                        chapter 14 because that action does not affect liquidation rights - the only rights that are relevant following a shareholder vote to dissolve.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the exception of reverse stock splits that result in cashing out some of the shares of a class or series, amended chapter 13 also eliminates appraisal in connection with all amendments to the articles of incorporation. This change in amended chapter
                        13 does not reflect a judgment that an amendment changing the terms of a particular class or series may not have significant economic effects. Rather, it reflects a judgment that distinguishing among different types of amendments
                        for the purposes of statutory appraisal is necessarily arbitrary and thus may not accurately reflect the actual demand of shareholders for appraisal in specific instances. Instead, amended chapter 13 permits a high degree of private-ordering
                        by delineating a list of transactions for which the corporation may voluntarily choose to provide appraisal and by permitting a provision in the articles of incorporation that eliminates, in whole or in part, statutory appraisal
                        rights for preferred shares.

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> also is unique in its approach to appraisal rights for publicly-traded shares. Approximately half of the general corporation statutes
                        in the United States provide exceptions to appraisal for publicly-traded shares, on the theory that it is not productive to expose the corporation to the time, expense and cash drain imposed by appraisal demands when shareholders
                        who are dissatisfied with the consideration offered in an appraisal-triggering transaction could sell their shares and obtain cash from the market. This exception to appraisal is generally known as the "market-out" and is referred
                        to here as the "market exception." Opponents of the market exception argue that it results in unfairness where neither the consideration offered in connection with the transaction nor the market price reflects the fair value of
                        the shares, particularly if the corporate decision-makers have a conflict of interest.

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> seeks to accommodate both views by providing a market exception that is limited to those situations where shareholders are likely to
                        receive fair value when they sell their shares in the market after the announcement of an appraisal-triggering transaction. For the market exception to apply under chapter 13, there must first be a liquid market. Second, unique
                        to chapter 13, the market exception does not apply in specified circumstances where the appraisal-triggering action is deemed to be a conflict-of-interest transaction.

                        The definition of "beneficial shareholder" means a person who owns the beneficial interest in shares; "shares" is defined in section 1.40(22) to include, without limitation, a holder of a depository receipt for shares. Similar definitions are found in
                        section 7.40(2) (derivative proceedings) and section 16.02(f) (inspection of records by a shareholder). In the context of chapter 13, beneficial shareholder means a person having a direct economic interest in the shares. The definition
                        is not intended to adopt the broad definition of beneficial ownership in SEC Rule 13d-2, which includes persons with a right to vote or dispose of the shares even though they have no economic interest in them. However, section
                        13.02(b)(5) includes the concept of the right to vote in determining whether the event represents a conflict transaction that renders the market exception unavailable.

                        The definition of "corporation"" in section 13.01(3) includes, for purposes of the post-transaction matters covered in section 13.22 through 13.31, a successor entity in a merger where the corporation is not the surviving entity. The definition does not
                        include a domestic acquiring corporation in a share exchange or disposition of assets because the corporation whose shares or assets were acquired continues in existence in both of these instances and remains responsible for the
                        appraisal obligations. Whether a foreign corporation or other form of domestic or foreign entity is subject to appraisal rights in connection with any of these transactions depends upon the corporation or other applicable law of
                        the relevant jurisdiction.

                    <p>
                        Subsection (i) of the definition of "fair value" in section 13.01(4) makes clear that fair value is to be determined immediately before the effectuation of the corporate action, rather than, as is the case under most state statutes that address the issue,
                        the date of the shareholders' vote. This comports with the purpose of this chapter to preserve the shareholder's prior rights as a shareholder until the effective date of the corporate action, rather than leaving the shareholder
                        in an ambiguous state with neither rights as a shareholder nor perfected appraisal rights. The corporation and, as relevant, its shares are valued as they exist immediately before the effectuation of the corporate action requiring
                        appraisal. Accordingly, section 13.01(4) permits consideration of changes in the market price of the corporation's shares in anticipation of the transaction, to the extent such changes are relevant. Similarly, in a two-step transaction
                        culminating in a merger, the corporation is valued immediately before the second step merger, taking into account any interim changes in value.

                        The definition of "fair value" in section 13.01(4) makes several changes from the prior version. The 1984 Model Act's definition of "fair value" was silent on how fair value was to be determined, except for a concluding clause that excluded from the valuation
                        "any appreciation or depreciation in anticipation of the corporate action, unless exclusion would be inequitable." The Official Comment provided that the section left to the courts "the details by which 'fair value' is to be determined
                        within the broad outlines of the definition." While the logic of the prior Official Comment continues to apply, the exclusionary clause in the prior Model Act definition, including the qualification for cases where the exclusion
                        would be inequitable, has been deleted. Those provisions have not been susceptible to meaningful judicial interpretation and have been set aside in favor of the broader concept in subsection (ii).

                        The new formulation in paragraph (ii), which is patterned on section 7.22 of the Principles of Corporate Governance promulgated by the American Law Institute, directs courts to keep the methodology chosen in appraisal proceedings consistent with evolving
                        economic concepts and adopts that part of section 7.22 which provides that fair value should be determined using "customary valuation concepts and techniques generally employed . . . for similar businesses in the context of the
                        transaction requiring appraisal." Subsection (ii) adopts the accepted view that different transactions and different contexts may warrant different valuation methodologies. Customary valuation concepts and techniques will typically
                        take into account numerous relevant factors, including assigning a higher valuation to corporate assets that would be more productive if acquired in a comparable transaction but excluding any element of value attributable to the
                        unique synergies of the actual purchaser of the corporation or its assets. For example, if the corporation's assets include undeveloped real estate that is located in a prime commercial area, the court should consider the value
                        that would be attributed to the real estate as commercial development property in a comparable transaction. The court should not, however, assign any additional value based upon the specific plans or special use of the actual purchaser.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Modern valuation methods will normally result in a range of values, not a particular single value. When a transaction falls within that range, "fair value" has been established. Absent unusual circumstances, it is expected that the consideration in an
                        arm's-length transaction will fall within the range of "fair value" for purposes of section 13.01(4). Section 7.22 of the ALI Principles of Corporate Governance also provides that in situations that do not involve certain types
                        of specified conflicts of interest, "the aggregate price accepted by the board of directors of the subject corporation should be presumed to represent the fair value of the corporation, or of the assets sold in the case of an asset
                        sale, unless the plaintiff can prove otherwise by clear and convincing evidence." That presumption has not been included in the definition of "fair value" in section 13.01(4) because the framework of defined types of conflict transactions
                        which is a predicate for the ALI"s presumption is not contained in the Model Act. Nonetheless, under section 13.01(4), a court determining fair value should give great deference to the aggregate consideration accepted or approved
                        by a disinterested board of directors for an appraisal-triggering transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (iii) of the definition of "fair value" establishes that valuation discounts for lack of marketability or minority status are inappropriate in most appraisal actions, both because most transactions that trigger appraisal rights affect the corporation
                        as a whole and because such discounts give the majority the opportunity to take advantage of minority shareholders who have been forced against their will to accept the appraisal-triggering transaction. Subsection (iii), in conjunction
                        with the lead-in language to the definition, is also designed to adopt the more modern view that appraisal should generally award a shareholder his or her proportional interest in the corporation after valuing the corporation as
                        a whole, rather than the value of the shareholder's shares when valued alone. If, however, the corporation voluntarily grants appraisal rights for transactions that do not affect the entire corporation - such as certain amendments
                        to the articles of incorporation - the court should use its discretion in applying discounts if appropriate. As the introductory clause of section 13.01 notes, the definition of "fair value" applies only to chapter 13. See the
                        Official Comment to section 14.34 which recognizes that a minority discount may be appropriate under that section.

                    <p>
                        The definition of "interest" in section 13.01(5) is included to apprise the parties of their respective rights and obligations. The right to receive interest is based on the elementary consideration that the corporation, rather than the shareholder demanding
                        appraisal, has the use of the shareholder's money from the effective date of the corporate action (when those shareholders who do not demand appraisal rights have the right to receive their consideration from the transaction) until
                        the date of payment. Section 13.01(5) thus requires interest to be paid at the rate of interest on judgments from the effective date of the corporate action until the date of payment. The specification of the rate of interest on
                        judgments, rather than a more subjective rate, eliminates a possible issue of contention and should facilitate voluntary settlements. Each state determines whether interest is compound or simple.

                        The definition of "senior executive" in section 13.01(8) encompasses the group of individuals in control of corporate information and the day-to-day operations. An employee of a subsidiary organization is a "senior executive" of the parent if the employee
                        is "in charge of a principal business unit or function" of the parent and its subsidiaries on a combined or consolidated basis.

                        The definition of "shareholder" in section 13.01(9) for purposes of chapter 13 differs from the definition of that term used elsewhere in the Model Act. Section 1.40(21) defines "shareholder" as used generally in the Act to mean only a "record shareholder";
                        that term is specifically defined in section 13.01(7). Section 13.01(9), on the other hand, defines "shareholder" to include not only a "record shareholder" but also a "beneficial shareholder," a term that is itself defined in
                        section 13.01(2). The specially defined terms "record shareholder" and "beneficial shareholder" appear primarily in section 13.03, which establishes the manner in which beneficial shareholders, and record shareholders who are acting
                        on behalf of beneficial shareholders, perfect appraisal rights. The word "shareholder" is used generally throughout chapter 13 in order to permit both record and beneficial shareholders to take advantage of the provisions of this
                        chapter, subject to their fulfilling the applicable requirements of this chapter.

                        The reference in the definition of "fair value" (in subdivision (3)) to "the effectuation of the corporate action" means the actual merger or other transaction that will occur after the shareholders vote on the transaction.

                    <p>
                        Subdivision 13.01(4) of the Model Act fixes the interest on fair value at the average rate currently paid by the corporation on its principal bank loans or, if none, at a rate that is fair and equitable under all the circumstances. This section differs
                        from that provision in fixing the statutory "legal rate" as a floor and allows the court more flexibility in fixing a fair interest rate by providing that it should be fair and equitable under the circumstances and that the rate
                        currently paid by the corporation on its principal bank loans, if any, is just one of those circumstances.

                        afford appraisal rights.

                        Section 13.02(a) establishes the scope of appraisal rights by identifying those transactions which afford this right. In view of the significant degree of private ordering permitted by section 13.02(a)(5), the scope of statutory appraisal provided is
                        somewhat narrower than that provided in the 1984 Model Act. As discussed in the first section of the Official Comment to section 13.01, statutory appraisal is made available only for corporate actions that will result in a fundamental
                        change in the shares to be affected by the action and then only when uncertainty concerning the fair value of the affected shares may cause reasonable differences about the fairness of the terms of the corporate action. The transactions
                        that satisfy both of these criteria are:

                            A merger pursuant to section 11.04 or a short-form merger pursuant to section 11.05. Holders of any class or series that is to be exchanged or converted in connection with a merger under section 11.04 are entitled both to a vote under section 11.04(f)
                            and to appraisal under section 13.02(a)(1). Although shareholders of a subsidiary that is a party to a merger under section 11.05 are not entitled to a vote, they are entitled to appraisal under 13.02(a)(1) because their interests
                            will be extinguished by the merger. Section 13.02(a)(1)(i) denies appraisal rights to any class or series of shares in the surviving corporation if such class or series remains outstanding.

                            A disposition of assets requiring shareholder approval under section 12.02. Minimally, shareholders of all classes or series of the corporation that are generally entitled to vote on matters requiring shareholder approval will be entitled to assert appraisal
                            rights. Whether shares of a class or series that do not have general voting rights will be entitled to vote on the asset disposition and thus become entitled to appraisal rights depends on the form of the transaction disposing
                            of the corporation's assets. In the usual form of this transaction, which is governed by chapter 12, the acquirer purchases substantially all of the assets and assumes substantially all of the liabilities of the corporation,
                            which then liquidates pursuant to a plan of dissolution approved by the shareholders as part of the transaction and distributes the consideration received from the acquirer to its shareholders. If the transaction provides a
                            non-voting class of preferred with its liquidation preference, there is no change in the contractual terms of the preferred and it is entitled neither to vote nor to appraisal rights. By the same token, a preferred class cannot
                            be required to accept any consideration different from that called for in its liquidation preference without amending the terms of the class. For example, a plan that called for the preferred to accept securities of the acquirer
                            in lieu of its cash liquidation preference would trigger both group voting and appraisal rights on behalf of the class. In the unusual event that the asset disposition plan contemplated that the corporation would continue in
                            existence, the terms of a nonvoting class would not have been changed as a result of the transaction, and appraisal rights would not be available. As provided in section 12.02(g), a disposition of assets by a corporation in
                            the course of dissolution under chapter 14 is governed by that chapter, not chapter 12, and thus does not implicate appraisal rights.

                            Amendments to the articles of incorporation that effectuate a reverse stock split which reduces the number of shares that a shareholder owns of a class or series to a fractional share if the corporation has the obligation or right to repurchase the fractional
                            share so created. The reasons for granting appraisal rights in this situation are similar to those granting such rights in cases of cash-out mergers, as both transactions could compel affected shareholders to accept cash for
                            their investment in an amount established by the corporation. Appraisal is afforded only for those shareholders of a class or series whose interest is so affected.

                            Any other merger, share exchange, disposition of assets or amendment to the articles to the extent the articles, bylaws, or a resolution of the board of directors grants appraisal rights to a particular class or series of stock. A corporation may voluntarily
                            wish to grant to the holders of one or more of its classes or series of shares appraisal rights in connection with these important transactions whenever the Act does not provide statutory appraisal rights. The grant of appraisal
                            rights may satisfy shareholders who might, in the absence of appraisal rights, seek other remedies. Moreover, in situations where the existence of appraisal rights may otherwise be disputed, the voluntary offer of those rights
                            under this section may avoid litigation. Obviously, an express grant of voluntary appraisal rights under section 13.02(a)(5) is intended to override any of the exceptions to the availability of appraisal rights in section 13.02(a).
                            Any voluntary grant of appraisal rights by the corporation to the holders of one or more of its classes or series of shares will thereby automatically make all of the provisions of chapter 13 applicable to the corporation and
                            such holders regarding this corporate action.

         Market Exception to Appraisal Rights

                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> provides a limited exception to appraisal rights for those situations where shareholders can either accept the consideration offered
                        in the appraisal-triggering transaction or can obtain the fair value of their shares by selling them in the market. This provision is predicated on the theory that where an efficient market exists, the market price will be an adequate
                        proxy for the fair value of the corporation's shares, thus making appraisal unnecessary. Furthermore, after the corporation announces an appraisal-triggering action, the market operates at maximum efficiency with respect to that
                        corporation's shares because interested parties and market professionals evaluate the offer and competing offers may be generated if the original offer is deemed inadequate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moreover, the market exception reflects an evaluation that the uncertainty, costs and time commitment involved in any appraisal proceeding are not warranted where shareholders can sell their shares in an efficient, fair and liquid market. For these reasons,
                        approximately half of the states have enacted market exceptions to their appraisal statutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For purposes of this chapter, the market exception is provided for a class or series if two criteria are met: the market in which the class or series is traded must be "liquid" and the value of the shares established by the appraisal-triggering event
                        must be "reliable." Liquidity is defined in section 13.02(b)(1) and requires the class or series of stock to satisfy either of two requirements: the class or series is either listed on the New York Stock Exchange or the American
                        Stock Exchange or is designated as a national market system security on an interdealer quotation system by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.; or, although not so listed or designated, the class or series has
                        at least 2,000 record or beneficial shareholders, provided that using both concepts does not result in duplication. In this instance, the outstanding class or series must also have a market value of at least $20 million, excluding
                        the value of shares held by the corporation's subsidiaries, senior executives, directors and beneficial shareholders owning more than 10 percent of the class or series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because section 13.02(b)(3) excludes from the market exception those transactions that require shareholders to accept anything other than cash or securities that also meet the liquidity tests of section 13.02(b)(1), shareholders are assured of receiving
                        either appraisal rights, cash from the transaction, or shares or other proprietary interests in the survivor entity that are liquid. Section 13.02(b)(2) provides that the corporation generally must satisfy the requirements of section
                        13.02(b)(1) on the record date for a shareholder vote on the appraisal-triggering transaction. For purposes of subsection 13.02(a)(1)(ii), the requirements of section 13.02(b)(1) must be met as of the day before the corporate action
                        becomes effective.

         Appraisal Rights in Conflict Transactions
        </i>

                    <p>
                        The premise of the market exception is that the market must be liquid and the valuation assigned to the relevant shares must be "reliable." Section 13.02(b)(1) is designed to assure liquidity. For purposes of these provisions, section 13.02(b)(4) is designed
                        to assure reliability by recognizing that the market price of, or consideration for, shares of a corporation that proposes to engage in a section 13.02(a) transaction may be subject to influences where a corporation's management,
                        controlling shareholders or directors have conflicting interests that could, if not dealt with appropriately, adversely affect the consideration that otherwise could have been expected. Section 13.02(b)(4) addresses two groups
                        of conflict transactions: those in clause (i), which involve controlling shareholders; and those in clause (ii), which involve senior executives and directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.02(b)(4)(i) covers two possible conflict situations: subsection (A) covers the acquisition or exchange of shares or assets of the corporation by a shareholder or an affiliate of the shareholder that could be considered controlling by virtue
                        of ownership of a substantial amount of voting stock (20 percent); and subsection (B) covers the acquisition or exchange of shares or assets of the corporation by an individual or group, or by an affiliate of such individual or
                        group, that has the ability to exercise control, through contract, stock ownership, or some other means, over at least one fourth of the board's membership. The definition of "beneficial owner" in section 13.02(b)(5) serves to
                        identify possible conflict situations by deeming each member of a group that agrees to vote in tandem to be a beneficial owner of all the voting shares owned by the group. In contrast, the term "beneficial shareholder," as defined
                        in section 13.01(2), is used to identify those persons entitled to appraisal rights. The last portion of subsection (A) recognizes that an acquisition effected in two steps (a tender offer followed by a merger) within one year,
                        where the two steps are either on the same terms or the second step is on terms that are more favorable to target shareholders, is properly considered a single transaction for purposes of identifying conflict transactions, regardless
                        of whether the second-step merger is governed by sections 11.04 or 11.05.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.02(b)(4)(ii) covers the acquisition or exchange of shares or assets of the corporation by a person, or an affiliate of a person, who is, or in the year leading up to the transaction was, a senior executive or director of the corporation. The
                        section eliminates the market exception for management buyouts because participation in the buyout group is itself "a financial benefit not available to other shareholders as such." The market exception is also not available for
                        transactions involving other types of economic benefits (in addition to benefits afforded to shareholders generally, as such) afforded to senior executives (as defined in section 13.01(8)) and directors in specified conflict situations,
                        unless specific objective or procedural standards are met. Section 13.01(1) specially defines the term "affiliate" for purposes of section 13.02(b)(4) to include an entity of which a person is a senior executive. Due to this specialized
                        definition, if a senior executive of the corporation is to continue and is to receive enumerated employment and other financial benefits after the transaction, the availability of the market exception will depend on meeting one
                        of the three conditions specified in clauses (A), (B) and (C) of section 13.02(b)(4)(ii).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, under section 13.02(b)(4)(ii)(A), the market exception is not lost if financial benefits that result from the transaction consist of employment, consulting, retirement or similar benefits established separately and not in contemplation of the transaction.
                        For example, if an individual has an arrangement under which benefits will be triggered on a "change of control," such as accelerated vesting of options, retirement benefits, deferred compensation and similar items, or is afforded
                        the opportunity to retire or leave the employ of the enterprise with more favorable economic results than would be the case absent a change of control, the existence of these arrangements would not disqualify the transaction from
                        the market exception if the arrangements had been established as a general condition of the individual's employment or continued employment, rather than in contemplation of the particular transaction. Second, under section 13.02(b)(4)(ii)(B),
                        if such arrangements are established as part of, or as a condition of, the transaction, the market exception will not be lost if the arrangements are either not more favorable than those already in existence or, if more favorable,
                        are approved by "qualified" directors (
                        <i>
        i.e.
       </i> , meeting the standard of independence specified in section 8.62(d)), in the same manner as is provided for conflicting interest transactions generally with the corporation under section 8.62. This category would include
                        arrangements with the corporation which have been negotiated as part of, or as a condition of, the transaction or arrangements with the acquiring company or one or more of its other subsidiaries. The third situation, delineated
                        in section 13.02(b)(4)(ii)(C), addresses a person who is a director of the issuer and, in connection with the transaction, is to become a director of the acquiring entity or its parent, or to continue as a director of the corporation
                        when it becomes a subsidiary of the acquiring entity. In this situation, the market exception is not lost as long as that person will not be treated more favorably as a director than are other persons who are serving in the same
                        director positions.

         Elimination of Appraisal Rights for Preferred Shares

                    <p>
                        Section 13.02(c) permits the corporation to eliminate or limit appraisal rights for the holders of one or more series or classes of preferred shares. The operative provisions may be set forth in the corporation's articles of incorporation as originally
                        filed or in any amendment thereto, but any such amendment will not become effective for one year with respect to outstanding shares or shares which the corporation is or may be required to issue or sell at some later date pursuant
                        to any rights outstanding prior to such amendment becoming effective. Shareholders who have not yet acquired, or do not have a right to acquire from the corporation, any shares of preferred stock, should have the ability either
                        not to acquire any shares of preferred stock or to have appraisal rights granted or restored for such shares, if such shareholders so desire, before purchasing them. In contrast, because the terms of common shares are rarely negotiated,
                        section 13.02 does not permit the corporation to eliminate or limit the appraisal rights of common shares.

         Exclusivity of Appraisal Rights
        </i>

                    <p>
                        With two exceptions, section 13.02(d) provides that the appraisal is the exclusive remedy for corporate action that has been completed. The theory underlying this section is that when a majority of shareholders has approved a corporate change, the corporation
                        should be permitted to proceed even if a minority considers the change unwise or disadvantageous. The very existence of the appraisal remedy recognizes that shareholders may disagree about the value of consequences of a corporate
                        action and that some may hold such strong views that they will want to vindicate them in a judicial proceeding. Since a judicial proceeding is insulated from the dynamics of an actual negotiation, it is not surprising that the
                        two processes could produce different valuations. Accordingly, if such a proceeding results in an award of additional consideration to the shareholders who pursued appraisal, no inference should be drawn that the judgment of the
                        majority was wrong or that compensation is now owed to shareholders who did not seek appraisal. Thus, an exclusivity principle is generally justified. Nevertheless, there may be exceptional circumstances where the process by which
                        the corporate action was approved was so flawed that it is appropriate to provide more general relief on behalf of all affected shareholders. Thus, section 13.02(d)(1) does not preclude challenges to serious procedural defects
                        in approving the action, such as a failure to obtain the votes required by statute or by the corporation's own articles, bylaws, or board resolution authorizing the transaction. Similarly, subsection (2) creates an exception for
                        cases where fraud or material misrepresentation have affected the shareholder vote to such an extent as to have caused the corporate action to be approved mistakenly. The concept of misrepresentation includes the omission of a
                        material fact necessary to make statements made not misleading.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Although section 13.02(d) does not address the question of remedies, such as injunctive relief, that may be available before the corporate action is effected, it should be noted that a complaint based solely on adequacy of consideration is not actionable
                        unless accompanied by credible allegations of wrongdoing. Section 13.02(d) is concerned with challenges only to the corporate action and does not address remedies, if any, that shareholders may have against directors or other persons
                        as a result of the corporate action. See section 8.31 and Official Comment.

                        Subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3) give a right of dissent for all shares, whether voting or nonvoting, in the case of a merger or sale or exchange of assets; the corresponding provisions in the Model Act give the right of dissent only to voting
                        shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The right of dissent under this section, however, does not apply in a merger to shares of a corporation when approval by the shareholders of that corporation is not required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a11s55-11-03ol1g" target="_self">G.S. 55-11-03(g)</a></cite>                        or to shares of a parent corporation in a merger under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a11s55-11-04" target="_self">G.S. 55-11-04</a></cite>. In addition, the right of dissent does not apply in a merger or share exchange to shares
                        that are redeemable by the corporation at the time of the transaction at a price not greater than the cash to be received in exchange for such shares. The Model Act was modified in clause (i) of subdivision (a)(1) to clarify that
                        the absence of a right of dissent applies only to the shares of the corporation covered by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a11s55-11-03ol1g" target="_self">G.S. 55-11-03(g)</a></cite> and not to shares of a corporation if approval
                        by its shareholders is required.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act was also modified in subdivision (a)(3) to provide that a right of dissent will not be available if the sale of property is pursuant to a plan by which all or substantially all of the net proceeds of the sale will be distributed in cash
                        to the shareholders within one year after the date of the sale. This is different from the Model Act, which requires the sale itself to be in cash. This subdivision thus allows more flexibility in permitting, for example, the sale
                        to be for promissory notes or other property that will be converted to cash for distribution within the one-year period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The language of the Model Act which excepts from the operation of the section "a limitation by dilution through issuance of shares or other securities with similar voting rights" was eliminated from the end of clause (iv) of subdivision (a)(4). The only
                        reason for this elimination was the drafters' opinion that the language is unnecessary; if it were necessary, it should also have been added to the end of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a10s55-10-04ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 55-10-04(a)(4)</a></cite>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clause (vi) of subdivision (a)(4), which is not in the Model Act, brings forward the same provisions in former G.S. 55-101(b). However, the drafters decided not to bring forward the unusual provision in former G.S. 55-102(a) that gave a right of dissent
                        to the holders of any class of preferred shares with dividend arrearages if the corporation offered to exchange such shares for shares with a prior preference and that offer was accepted by any of the preferred shareholders. Such
                        a situation may be covered by clause (i) of subdivision (a)(4).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The introductory language of subsection 13.02(a) of the Model Act was modified to provide that the rights provided by this section are in addition to any rights provided by Article 9.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By making the appraisal remedy exclusive unless the transaction is "unlawful" or "fraudulent," subsection (b) effects a change from former G.S. 55-113(b), which provided that such remedy was "in addition to any other right [the shareholder] may have in
                        law or in equity."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Language was added to the Model Act provision to make it clear that subsection (b) covers a cash merger and that, in determining whether a merger was "unlawful" or "fraudulent," the same standard applies, regardless of whether the consideration received
                        was cash, other property, or shares of a surviving corporation.

                        Effective October 1, 2011, this section was amended to limit appraisal rights under subdivision (a)(1), (2) and (3) to voting shares in the case of a merger or share exchange or sale of assets. The prior statute gave a right of appraisal for all shares,
                        whether voting or non-voting, in such transactions. Subdivision (d), which is not in the Model Act, grandfathers the appraisal rights of a shareholder holding shares of a class or series that were issued and outstanding as of the
                        effective date of the Act but that did not as of that date entitle the shareholder to vote on a corporate action described in subdivision (a)(1), (2) or (3) of this section; such shareholder shall be entitled to appraisal rights
                        to the same extent as if such shares did entitle the shareholder to vote on such corporate action.

                        Corporations are afforded flexibility under Article 13 to deviate from the specified corporate actions that give rise to appraisal rights and the shareholders entitled to such rights. Under subdivision (a)(5) appraisal rights can be extended to any shareholders
                        in connection with any amendment to the articles of incorporation, merger, share exchange or disposition of assets to the extent provided in the articles, bylaws or a resolution of the board of directors.

                        Dissent and appraisal was the exclusive remedy for shareholders aggrieved by the price offered and the method by which the price was set in a cash-out merger of a North Carolina corporation; where a minority shareholder's complaint centered around an
                        allegation that a corporation's directors and a buyer had engaged in a course of conduct designed to enable them to buy the shares of the minority at an unfair price, the complaint failed to adequately allege an unlawful or fraudulent

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.03 addresses the relationship between those who are entitled to assert appraisal rights and the widespread practice of nominee or street name ownership of publicly-held shares. Generally, a shareholder must demand appraisal for all the shares
                        of a class or series which the shareholder owns. If a record shareholder is a nominee for several beneficial shareholders, some of whom wish to demand appraisal and some of whom do not, section 13.03(a) permits the record shareholder
                        to assert appraisal rights with respect to a portion of the shares held of record by the record shareholder but only with respect to all the shares beneficially owned by a single person. This limitation is necessary to prevent
                        abuse by a single beneficial shareholder who is not fundamentally opposed to the proposed corporate action but who may wish to speculate on the appraisal process, as to some of that shareholder's shares, on the possibility of a
                        high payment. On the other hand, a shareholder who owns shares in more than one class or series may assert appraisal rights for only some but not all classes or series that the shareholder owns. This is permitted because fair treatment
                        of one class or series does not guarantee fair treatment of other classes or series.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.03(a) also requires a record shareholder who demands appraisal with respect to a portion of the shares held by the record shareholder to notify the corporation of the name and address of the beneficial owner on whose behalf the record shareholder
                        has demanded appraisal rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.03(b) permits a beneficial shareholder to assert appraisal rights directly if the beneficial shareholder submits the record shareholder's written consent. Although generally the record shareholder is treated as the owner of shares, this section
                        recognizes that sometimes the record shareholders are holding shares on behalf of beneficial shareholders. It would be foreign to the premises underlying nominee and street name ownership to require these record shareholders to
                        forward demands and participate in litigation on behalf of their clients. In order to make appraisal rights effective without burdening record shareholders, beneficial shareholders should be allowed to assert their own claims as
                        provided in this subsection. The beneficial shareholder is required to submit, no later than the date specified in section 13.22(b)(2)(ii), a written consent by the record shareholder to the assertion of appraisal rights to verify
                        the beneficial shareholder's entitlement and to permit the protection of any security interest in the shares. In practice, a broker's customer who wishes to assert appraisal rights may request the broker to supply the customer
                        with the name of the record shareholder (which may be a house nominee or a nominee of the Depository Trust Company), and a form of consent signed by the record shareholder. At the same time, the customer may want to obtain certificates
                        for the shares so that they may be deposited pursuant to section 13.23. After the corporation has received the form of consent, the corporation must deal with the beneficial shareholder.

                        The drafters did not include the language at the end of subsection 13.03(b)(3) of the Model Act requiring a beneficial owner to dissent with respect to all shares "over which he has power to direct the vote" because they concluded that it could be construed
                        to include shares which that person did not own either as beneficial or record holder but for which he or she was a proxy or could exercise a power of attorney. That result was not deemed desirable.

                    <p>
                        Before a vote is taken on a corporate action, the corporation is required by section 13.20(a) to notify record shareholders that a transaction is proposed and that the corporation has concluded either that appraisal rights are or are not available; alternatively,
                        if the corporation is unsure about the availability of appraisal rights, it may state that appraisal rights may be available. Notice of appraisal rights is needed because many shareholders do not know what appraisal rights they
                        may have or how to assert them. If the corporation has concluded appraisal rights are or may be available, the notice must be accompanied by a copy of this chapter.

                    <p>
                        Section 13.20(b) provides that notice be given by the parent corporation within ten days after the effective date of a merger of its subsidiary under section 11.05. This notice may be combined with the notice required by section 13.22.

                        This section adds to the Model Act's provisions the 10-day requirement in subsection (b) and the new subsection (c). A similar 10-day requirement is included in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a13s55-13-22ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 55-13-22(b)</a></cite>                        and in section 13.22(b) of the Model Act. The new subsection (c) was adapted from former G.S. 55-113(f), except that the period within which the damage action may be brought was increased from one to three years, thus increasing
                        the burden on the corporation to comply with the statute. The shareholder must bring the damage action "in his own name," and not as a class or derivative action.

                    <p>
                        Section 13.21 applies to all transactions requiring appraisal, except short-form mergers under section 11.05. In the latter case, shareholders of the subsidiary do not vote on the transaction but are nevertheless entitled to appraisal.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.21(a) requires the shareholder to give notice of an intent to demand payment before the vote on the corporate action is taken. This notice enables the corporation to determine how much of a cash payment may be required. It also serves to limit
                        the number of persons to whom the corporation must give further notice during the remainder of the appraisal process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order for a shareholder to remain eligible to demand payment, section 13.21(a)(2) mandates that the shareholder must not vote (or, in the case of a beneficial shareholder, cause or permit to be voted) any shares of any class or series for which the
                        shareholder is demanding appraisal in favor of the proposal.

                        The amendments provide that the shareholder must provide a notice of intent to demand an appraisal rights payment before the corporate action becomes effective provided notice of the corporate action was given to the shareholder
                        at least 25 days before the effective time. The amendments also provide procedures for exercising appraisal rights to non-tendering shareholders in second-step mergers following a tender offer in which offeror gains control under

                    <p>
                        The purpose of section 13.22 is to require the corporation to provide shareholders with information and a form for perfecting appraisal rights. The content of this notice and form are spelled out in detail to ensure that they accomplish this purpose.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When an action is submitted to the vote of shareholders, the appraisal notice must be sent only to those persons who gave notice of their intention to demand appraisal under section 13.21 and did not vote (or permit or cause to be voted) such shares in
                        favor of the proposed action. In a short-form merger under section 11.05, the notice must be sent to all persons who may be eligible for appraisal rights no earlier than the effective date of the merger and no later than ten days
                        thereafter. In either case, the notice must be accompanied by a copy of this chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The notice must supply a form to be used by the person asserting appraisal rights in order to complete the exercise of those rights. Under section 13.22(b)(2)(ii), the notice must specify the date by which the shareholder's executed form must be received
                        by the corporation, which date must be at least 40 days but not more than 60 days after the appraisal notice is sent.

                    <p>
                        Under section 13.22(b)(2)(i), the notice must also specify where and when share certificates must be deposited; the time for deposit may not be set at a date earlier than the date for receiving the required form under section 13.22(b)(2)(ii).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 13.22(b)(1) and (2)(i) require the corporation to specify in the form supplied for demanding payment where the form must be sent as well as the date of the first announcement of the terms of the proposed corporate action. This is the critical
                        date for determining the rights of shareholder-transferees: persons who became shareholders prior to that date are entitled to full appraisal rights, while persons who became shareholders on or after that date are entitled only
                        to the more limited rights provided by section 13.25. See the Official Comments to sections 13.23 and 13.25. The date set forth in the form should be the date the principal terms of the transaction were announced by the corporation
                        to shareholders. This may be the day the terms were communicated directly to the shareholders, included in a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, published in a newspaper of general circulation that can be
                        expected to reach the financial community, or any earlier date on which such terms were first announced by any other person or entity to such persons or sources. Any announcement to news media or to shareholders that relates to
                        the proposed transaction but does not contain the principal terms of the transaction to be authorized at the shareholders' meeting is not considered to be an announcement for the purposes of section 13.22.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 13.22(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iv) require the corporation to state its estimate of the fair value of the shares and how shareholders may obtain the number of shareholders and number of shares demanding appraisal rights. The information required
                        by sections 13.22(b)(2)(iii) and (b)(2)(iv) is intended to help shareholders assess whether they wish to demand payment or to withdraw their demand for appraisal, but the information under section 13.22(b)(2)(iv) is required to
                        be sent only to those shareholders from whom the corporation has received a written request. If such request is received, the corporation must respond within ten days after forms are due pursuant to section 13.22(b)(2)(ii). Finally,
                        section 13.22(b)(2)(v) requires the corporation to specify the date by which the shareholder's notice to withdraw under section 13.23 must be received.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.23 permits shareholders to perfect their appraisal rights under subsection (a), subject to their right to withdraw under subsection (b). In the case of a transaction involving a vote by shareholders, returning the executed form and, in the
                        case of certificated shares, depositing the shares are the shareholder's confirmation of the shareholder's intention expressed earlier under section 13.21(a) to pursue appraisal rights; in the case of a merger of a subsidiary under
                        section 11.05, it is the shareholder's first statement of this position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shareholder should include on the appraisal form a certification as to whether the date on which the beneficial shareholder acquired beneficial ownership of the shares was before (or on or after) the date the transaction was announced. See section
                        13.22(b)(1). This information permits the corporation to exercise its right under section 13.25 to defer payment of compensation for certain shares. The corporation may elect to proceed under section 13.25 with respect to those
                        shareholders who fail to make the required certification.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.23(a) also requires persons with certificated shares who file the required form to deposit their share certificates as directed by the corporation in its appraisal notice. Once a shareholder deposits that shareholder's shares, that shareholder
                        loses all rights as a shareholder unless the shareholder withdraws from the appraisal process pursuant to section 13.23(b).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With respect to certificated shares, this provision differs from many statutes in that the certificates are deposited for retention, rather than "submitted for notation." This difference reflects the requirement in section 13.22(b)(2)(i) for deposit only
                        after the corporate action became effective; in contrast, many state statutes require shareholders to send in their certificates in anticipation of the effectuation of the proposed corporate action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alternatively, under section 13.23(b), a shareholder may withdraw from the appraisal process by so notifying the corporation in writing by the deadline set forth in the appraisal notice. After that date, however, a shareholder who has complied with the
                        requirements to execute and return the form and, in the case of certificated shares, deposit the share certificates may not withdraw from the process without the corporation's written consent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under section 13.23(c), a shareholder who fails to execute and return the form with respect to the shares of a class or series for which the shareholder is demanding appraisal or does not deposit that shareholder's share certificates as required by section
                        13.23(a) loses all rights to pursue appraisal and obtain payment under this chapter. If a beneficial shareholder wishes to assert appraisal rights in place of the record shareholder, the beneficial shareholder must also comply
                        with section 13.03(b).

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.24 is applicable both to shareholders who have complied with section 13.23(a), as well as to shareholders who are described in section 13.25(a) if the corporation so chooses. The corporation must, however, elect to treat all shareholders described
                        in section 13.25(a) either under section 13.24 or under section 13.25; it may not elect to treat some shareholders from this group under section 13.24 but treat others under section 13.25. Considerations of simplicity and harmony
                        may prompt the corporation to elect to treat all shareholders under section 13.24.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.24 changes the relative balance between the corporation and shareholders demanding appraisal by requiring the corporation to pay in cash within 30 days after the required form is due the corporation's estimate of the fair value of the stock
                        plus interest. Section 13.24(b)(2) requires that estimate to at least equal the corporation's estimate of fair value given pursuant to section 13.22(b)(2)(iii). Since under section 13.23(a) all rights as a shareholder are terminated
                        with the deposit of that shareholder's shares, the former shareholder should have immediate use of such money. A difference of opinion over the total amount to be paid should not delay payment of the amount that is undisputed.
                        Thus, the corporation must pay its estimate of fair value, plus interest from the effective date of the corporate action, without waiting for the conclusion of the appraisal proceeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the former shareholder must decide whether or not to accept the payment in full satisfaction, the corporation must at this time furnish the former shareholder with the information specified in section 13.24(b), with a reminder of the former shareholder's
                        further rights and liabilities.

                        This section differs from the Model Act by requiring the corporation to send its offer of payment, rather than payment itself, to the dissenter upon completion of the transaction or (if the transaction did not need shareholder approval and has been completed)
                        upon receipt of payment demand. Payment is made to the dissenter upon his acceptance of the corporation's offer in writing. Payment is made to the nonaccepting dissenter at the commencement of the court proceeding under

                        Section 13.25(a) gives the corporation the option to treat differently shares acquired on or after the date of public announcement of the proposed corporate action; this date is specified by the corporation in its appraisal notice under section 13.22(b)(1).
                        At the corporation's option, holders of shares acquired on or after this date, or shareholders who fail to certify otherwise under section 13.23(a), are not entitled to immediate payment under section 13.24. Instead, shareholders
                        described in subsection (a) may receive only an offer of payment which is conditioned on their agreement to accept it in full satisfaction of their claim. If the right of unconditional immediate payment were granted as to all after-acquired
                        shares, speculators and others might be tempted to buy shares merely for the purpose of demanding appraisal. Since the function of appraisal rights is to protect investors against unforeseen changes, there is no need to give equally
                        favorable treatment to purchasers who knew or should have known about the proposed changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The date used as a cut-off for determining the application of this section is when "the principal terms" of the transaction are first announced to shareholders or to a newspaper of general circulation that can be expected to reach the financial community
                        or included in a public filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The cut-off should not be set at an earlier date, such as when the first public statement that the corporate action was under consideration was made, because
                        the goal of this section is to prevent use of appraisal rights as a speculative device after the terms of the transaction are announced. See the Official Comment to section 13.22.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 13.25(b) requires the corporation to furnish specified information to all shareholders described in subsection (a) and offer them the option of accepting the corporation's estimate of fair value plus interest, in full satisfaction of their claims,
                        provided that such shareholders so accept and notify the corporation within ten days of receiving this offer. Within ten days after receiving a shareholder's acceptance, the corporation must pay that shareholder in cash the stated
                        fair value plus interest.

                        A shareholder may accept the offered payment in full satisfaction of that shareholder's claim; alternatively, a shareholder may reject the corporation's offer and demand a judicial determination under section 13.26 and payment of the amount so determined
                        at the termination of the proceeding. A shareholder who does not satisfy the requirements of section 13.26 shall be deemed to have accepted the corporation's offer.

                        A shareholder who is not content with the corporation's remittance under section 13.24, or offer of remittance under section 13.25, and wishes to pursue appraisal rights further must state in writing the amount the shareholder is willing to accept. A
                        shareholder whose demand is deemed arbitrary, unreasonable or not in good faith, however, runs the risk of being assessed litigation expenses under section 13.31. These provisions are designed to encourage settlement without a

                        early decision on initiating appraisal proceedings. A failure to make such demand causes the shareholder to relinquish under section 13.26(b) anything beyond the amount the corporation paid or offered to pay.

                        The Model Act was modified in this section to reflect the fact that under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a13s55-13-25" target="_self">G.S. 55-13-25</a></cite>, a dissenter who has not accepted the corporation's offer has not yet

        OFFICIAL COMMENT TO THE 2002 MODEL BUSINESS CORPORATION ACT
       </b>

                    <p>
                        Section 13.30 retains the concept of judicial appraisal as the ultimate means of determining fair value. The proceeding is to be commenced by the corporation within 60 days after a timely demand for payment under section 13.26 was received. If the proceeding
                        is not commenced within this period, the corporation must pay the additional amounts demanded by the shareholders under section 13.26. See the Official Comment to section 13.26.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All demands for payment made under section 13.26 are to be resolved in a single proceeding brought in the county in the state where the corporation's principal office is located or, if it is a foreign corporation, where its registered office is located,
                        or if it has no registered office, where the principal office of the corporation which issued the shares to be appraised was located. All shareholders making section 13.26 demands must be made parties, with service by publication
                        authorized if necessary. Appraisers may be appointed within the discretion of the court. Since the nature of the proceeding is similar to a proceeding in equity or for an accounting, section 13.30(d) provides that there is no right
                        to a jury trial. The final judgment establishes not only the fair value of the shares in the abstract but also determines how much each shareholder who made a section 13.26 demand should actually receive.

                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act in several respects. The North Carolina version provides for the court proceeding to be commenced by the dissenter rather than the corporation. At the commencement of the proceeding, the corporation must pay the
                        amount of its offer to the dissenter. A dissenter who does not commence a timely court proceeding may either accept the corporation's offer or resume his status as a nondissenting shareholder. A dissenter who takes no action resumes
                        the status of a nondissenting shareholder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection 13.30(b) of the Model Act contains special venue provisions for proceedings under this section. That provision was omitted, and general venue rules apply.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section expressly provides in subsection (d) that dissenters in a public corporation are not entitled to a jury trial in the appraisal of the "fair value" of their shares.

        Editor's Note.
       </b> - This section was amended by both S.L. 1997-202, s. 4 (amending subsection (a) and repealing subsection (a1)), and S.L. 1997-485, ss. 5 and 5.1 (amending subsections (a), (c), and (d)). The effective date provisions
                        of the two acts differed. S.L. 1997-202 applied to corporate actions to which shareholders could dissent occurring on or after October 1, 1997. S.L. 1997-485, s. 5, applied to proceedings commenced on or after October 1, 1997.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To fill a potential gap between the two acts, S.L. 1997-485, s. 5.1, amended subsection (a), as amended by s. 5 of that act, to read:
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a13s55-13-28" target="_self">G.S. 55-13-28</a></cite> by filing a complaint with the Superior Court Division of the General Court of Justice to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued
                        interest. Within 10 days after service upon it of [the] complaint, the corporation shall pay to the dissenter the amount offered by the corporation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a13s55-13-25" target="_self">G.S. 55-13-25</a></cite>."

                    <p>
                        Section 13.31(a) provides a general rule that the costs of the appraisal proceeding should be assessed against the corporation. Nevertheless, the court is authorized to assess these costs, in whole or in part, against all or some of the shareholders demanding
                        appraisal if it concludes they acted arbitrarily, vexatiously, or not in good faith regarding the rights provided by this chapter. Similarly, under section 13.31(b), the court may assess fees and expenses of counsel and experts
                        against the corporation or against all or some of the shareholders demanding appraisal for the reasons stated in this subsection. Under section 13.31(c), if the corporation is not required to pay the counsel fees for the shareholders
                        demanding appraisal, the court may require all shareholders who benefitted from the services of counsel to share in the payment of such fees. The purpose of all these grants of discretion with respect to costs and counsel fees
                        is to increase the incentives of both sides to proceed in good faith under this chapter to attempt to resolve their disagreement without the need of a formal judicial appraisal of the value of shares.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While subsections (a)-(c) allocate costs and expenses in an appraisal proceeding, subsection (d) covers the situation where the corporation was obligated to make payment and did not meet this obligation. In that event, the shareholder may sue the corporation
                        directly for the amount owed. In such an action, subsection (d) requires the court, to the extent the shareholder was successful, to impose all costs and expenses, including counsel fees, on the corporation.

                        Subsection (a) of this section differs from the Model Act by providing simply that "the court shall assess the costs as it finds equitable." This language was adapted from former G.S. 55-113(e). The words "either or" were inserted before "any other" in
                        subdivision (b)(2) to clarify a possible ambiguity.

                    <p>
                        Section 14.01 provides a simple method of voluntary dissolution for a corporation that has not issued shares or commenced business. These provisions are alternative: a corporation may utilize section 14.01 if it has not issued shares (even though it has
                        commenced business) or if it has issued shares but has not commenced business. Dissolution may be accomplished in either of these situations simply by a majority vote of the incorporators or initial directors. (See section 2.05
                        and its Official Comment for a discussion of the roles of "incorporators" or "initial directors" in the organization of a corporation.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This simple method of dissolution is likely to be used by name-holding corporations or by corporations formed for the initiation of a new venture when the reasons for the initial creation of the corporation have been completely realized or will never
                        come to fruition.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The form of articles of dissolution provided in section 14.01 takes account of the fact that a corporation may utilize this section even though it has received capital from the issuance of shares or has incurred liabilities either from the commencement
                        of business without issuing shares or from its organization; hence the articles must state that no debts remain unpaid, and that the net assets of the corporation remaining after winding up have been distributed to the shareholders.

                        and the articles of dissolution must identify the officers and directors or, if none, the incorporators.

                        A corporation that has issued shares and commenced business may dissolve voluntarily only with the approval of its shareholders. Section 14.02 requires the board of directors to propose dissolution and then submit the proposal to the shareholders. The
                        board of directors must make a recommendation to the shareholders that the proposal to dissolve be approved, unless it determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation.
                        If the board of directors so determines, it must describe the conflict or circumstances, and communicate the basis for its determination, to the shareholders when presenting the proposal to dissolve to the shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dissolution, to be approved, must receive the vote of a majority of the outstanding votes entitled by the articles of incorporation to vote on the proposal. This is a greater vote than that required for ordinary matters under section 7.25. Nonvoting classes
                        of shares are not given a statutory right to vote on proposals to dissolve (either as separate voting groups or together with voting shares) by the Revised Model Act on the theory that, upon dissolution, the rights of all classes
                        or series of shares are fixed by the articles of incorporation. The articles of incorporation, however, may stipulate that specified classes or series of shares are entitled to vote by separate voting groups. Thus, in the absence
                        of specific provision in the articles of incorporation, only the shares of the corporation entitled to vote generally by the articles of incorporation are entitled to vote on dissolution. The articles of incorporation may also
                        specify that a greater percentage of votes is required to approve the proposal than is required by section 14.02.

                        The board of directors may condition its submission of a proposal to the shareholders under subsection (c) on its receiving a specified percentage of the votes of shareholders of one or more classes or series, voting by separate voting groups, or on some
                        other basis. See the discussion of conditional submissions in the Official Comment to section 10.03.

                        This section differs from former G.S. 55-118(a) in that only voting shares are entitled to vote on a proposal to dissolve and, unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation, a bylaw adopted by the shareholders, or the resolution of the board
                        of directors approving the dissolution, only a majority of the voting shares is required to adopt the proposal. It should be noted that all shareholders, whether or not entitled to vote, are still entitled to notice of the shareholders'
                        meeting at which the dissolution proposal will be considered. Under prior law, the board of directors was required to recommend the dissolution; under this section, the board must recommend the dissolution proposal to the shareholders
                        unless it determines that, because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances, it should make no recommendation to the shareholders. In addition, the board of directors may now condition its submission of a dissolution
                        proposal "on any basis."

                    <p>
                        The language of the Model Act was modified in subsection (b) to conform to changes made in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a10s55-10-03" target="_self">G.S. 55-10-03</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        Under former G.S. 55-117, a corporation could be dissolved by written consent of all of the shareholders, without action by the board of directors. This provision was not brought forward.

                        Statute Settles Question as to When Dissolution Allowed. - Former G.S. 55-121 settled the question formerly much mooted in the courts as to whether, and under what circumstances, a corporation could be dissolved by the stockholders, when no time was fixed
                        for its duration, upholding and extending this power of voluntary dissolution as established by the better considered decisions on the subject. White v. Kincaid, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 415</cite>,

                        Part of Every Charter. - The provision of the statute enters into every charter, and unless otherwise enacted by the legislature, every stockholder takes and holds his stock subject to the power of voluntary dissolution, by resolution of the directors
                        concurred in by two thirds in interest of the stockholders. White v. Kincaid, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 415</cite>, 63 S.E. 109 (1908).

                        Directors Are Trustees in Dissolution Proceedings. - The directors of a corporation in proceedings for dissolution are trustees in the sense that they must act faithfully in their judgment for the benefit of the corporation and in furtherance of its interest,
                        and not for the purpose of unjustly oppressing the holders of the minority stock, or to attain their own personal ends. White v. Kincaid, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 415</cite>, 63 S.E. 109 (1908).

                    <p>
                        Motive for Dissolution Generally Immaterial. - When a corporation lawfully proceeds to wind up its affairs in accordance with the statute, the motive prompting the act, however reprehensible or malicious, is not, as a rule, relevant to the inquiry; and
                        the courts will not undertake to interfere with the honest exercise of discretionary powers vested by statute in the management of a corporation, however unwise or improvident it may seem in a given instance. White v. Kincaid,

                        Suits Pending Dissolution. - Where it appears in an action that the indebtedness sought to be recovered was claimed to be due a corporation, and that the suit was instituted by the individual stockholders, a judgment as of nonsuit is properly entered,
                        though proceedings in dissolution of the corporation were being had under the statute, the proper party plaintiff being the corporation or a receiver appointed therefor. Worthington v. Gilmers, Inc.,

                        The act of filing the articles of dissolution makes the decision to dissolve a matter of public record and establishes the time when the corporation must begin the process of winding up and cease carrying on its business except to the extent necessary
                        for winding-up. The articles of dissolution must describe the manner in which the proposal to dissolve was submitted to the shareholders and describe the vote taken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Under the Model Act, articles of dissolution may be filed at the commencement of winding-up or at any time thereafter. This is the only filing required for voluntary dissolution; no filing is required to mark the completion of winding-up since the existence
                        of the corporation continues for certain purposes even after the business is wound up and the assets remaining after satisfaction of all creditors are distributed to the shareholders. No time limit for filing the articles is specified,
                        and it often may be desirable to postpone filing until winding up is far along or even complete.

                    <p>
                        A corporation is dissolved on the date the articles of dissolution are effective. After this date the corporation is referred to as a "dissolved corporation," although its existence continues under section 14.05 for purposes of winding up.

                        Articles of dissolution are the only required filing under this Act, and a corporation is dissolved on the effective date of its articles of dissolution. There is no filing comparable to the certificate of completed liquidation required under former G.S.
                        55-121. Articles of dissolution may be filed at any time after dissolution is authorized.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section modifies the Model Act by providing that the articles of dissolution shall contain the names and addresses of the corporation's officers and directors, so that creditors and other interested parties can identify the persons responsible for
                        winding up the affairs of the corporation. Minor clarifying changes were also made in subsection (a).

                        Voluntary dissolution may be revoked within 120 days of the effective date of the dissolution. Because of the importance and finality of dissolution, the decision to revoke dissolution generally requires shareholder authorization (unless the dissolution
                        was approved solely by the initial directors or incorporators under section 14.01). Section 14.04(b), however, contemplates that the board of directors may revoke dissolution if it is granted that authority in advance by the shareholders
                        when approving the dissolution. Such authorization is often included in proposals to dissolve that are contingent upon the effectuation of another transaction, such as a sale of corporate assets not in the ordinary course of business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certain other action requiring shareholder approval may be revoked by the board of directors without express shareholder approval. (See sections 11.03 and 12.02). By contrast, dissolution under section 14.04 may not be revoked by the board of directors
                        without approval of the shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Articles of revocation of dissolution must be filed to reflect the decision to resume the business of the corporation. The information required in these articles parallels the information required in the original articles of dissolution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The effect of articles of revocation of dissolution is to eliminate the requirement that the corporation cease to conduct its business except as part of the winding-up process and permit it to resume its business without limitation and as if dissolution
                        had never occurred.

                        Under former G.S. 55-120(a), a corporation could revoke its dissolution at any time prior to the filing of the certificate of completed liquidation. Since the provision for filing a certificate of completed liquidation has not been brought forward, this
                        section provides that any revocation must occur within 120 days after the effective date of the dissolution.

                        subject to the rights of any person who reasonably relied to his prejudice upon the filing of the articles of dissolution.

                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 55-120(c) expressly provided for a shareholder's suit to cancel articles of dissolution containing false statements. Although this Act contains no similar provision, such a suit could continue to be brought under general principles.

                    <p>
                        Section 14.05(a) provides that dissolution does not terminate the corporate existence but simply requires the corporation thereafter to devote itself to winding up its affairs and liquidating its assets; after dissolution, the corporation may not carry
                        on its business except as may be appropriate for winding-up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act uses the term "dissolution" in the specialized sense described above and not to describe the final step in the liquidation of the corporate business. This is made clear by section 14.05(b), which provides that chapter 14 dissolution does
                        not have any of the characteristics of common law dissolution, which treated corporate dissolution as analogous to the death of a natural person and abated lawsuits, vested equitable title to corporate property in the shareholders,
                        imposed the fiduciary duty of trustees on directors who had custody of corporate assets, and revoked the authority of the registered agent. Section 14.05(b) expressly reverses all of these common law attributes of dissolution and
                        makes clear that the rights, powers, and duties of shareholders, the directors, and the registered agent are not affected by dissolution and that suits by or against the corporation are not affected in any way.

                        The consequences of filing articles of dissolution under this Act remain the same as under former G.S. 55-114(b). Subdivision (b)(2) expressly permits the dissolution proposal to provide for closing of the corporation's share transfer records, a procedure
                        that was not specifically addressed under prior law.

                    <p>
                        Sections 14.06 and 14.07 provide a new and simplified system for handling known and unknown claims against a dissolved corporation, including claims based on events that occur after the dissolution of the corporation. Section 14.06 deals solely with known
                        claims while section 14.07 deals with unknown or subsequently arising claims. A claim is a "known" claim even if it is unliquidated (see section 14.06(d)); a claim that is contingent or has not matured so that there is no immediate
                        right to bring suit is not a "known" claim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Known claims are handled in section 14.06 through a process of written notice to claimants; the written notice must contain the information described in section 14.06(b). Section 14.06(c) then provides fixed deadlines by which claims are barred under
                        various circumstances, as follows:

                            If a claimant receives written notice satisfying section 14.06(b) but fails to file the claim by the deadline specified by the corporation, the claim is barred by section 14.06(c)(1).
                        </li>

                                    if the corporation does not act on the claim or fails to notify the claimant of the rejection, the claimant is not barred by section 14.06(c) until the corporation notifies the claimant.

                        These principles, it should be emphasized, do not lengthen statutes of limitation applicable under general state law. Thus claims that are not barred under the foregoing rules - for example, if the corporation does not act on a claim - will nevertheless
                        be subject to the general statute of limitations applicable to claims of that type.

                        Even though the directors are not trustees of the assets of a dissolved corporation (see section 14.05(b)(3)), they must discharge or make provision for discharging all of the corporation's known liabilities before distributing the remaining assets to
                        the shareholders. See sections 14.05(a)(3) and (4). See also sections 6.40 and 8.33.

                        This section provides a dissolved corporation with a new procedure for dealing expeditiously with "known claims." However, the procedure is permissive and, unlike former G.S. 55-119, notice to creditors and newspaper publication are not mandatory.

                    <p>
                        Earlier versions of the Model Act did not recognize the serious problem created by possible claims that might arise long after the dissolution process was completed and the corporate assets distributed to shareholders. Most of these claims were based
                        on personal injuries occurring after dissolution but caused by allegedly defective products sold before dissolution, but they also involved negligence for which the statute of limitations did not begin to run until the negligence
                        was discovered (e.g., a surgical instrument left inside the patient). The application of the Model Act provision (and of the state dissolution statutes phrased in different terms) to this problem led to confusing and inconsistent
                        results. See generally Friedlander and Gilbert, "Post Dissolution Liabilities of Shareholders and Directors for Claims Against Dissolved Corporations," 31 VAND. L. REV. 1363 (1978). The problems raised by this type of litigation
                        are intractable: on the one hand, the application of a mechanical two-year limitation period to a claim for injury that occurs after the period has expired involves obvious injustice to the plaintiff. On the other hand, to permit
                        these suits generally makes it impossible ever to complete the winding up of the corporation, make suitable provision for creditors, and distribute the balance of the corporate assets to the shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some circumstances a tort law concept of transferee liability, sometimes characterized as "de facto merger," has been applied to allow plaintiffs incurring post dissolution injuries to bring suit against the person that acquired the corporate assets.
                        See the Official Comment to section 11.01. Some courts have refused to apply this doctrine, particularly when the purchaser of the corporate assets has not continued the business of the dissolved corporation. In these cases, the
                        remedy of the plaintiff is limited to claims against the dissolved corporation and its shareholders receiving assets pursuant to the dissolution.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The solution adopted in section 14.07 is to continue the liability of a dissolved corporation for subsequent claims for a period of five years after it publishes notice of dissolution. It is recognized that a five year cut-off is itself arbitrary, but
                        it is believed that the great bulk of post dissolution claims will arise during this period. This provision is therefore believed to be a reasonable compromise between the competing considerations of providing a remedy to injured
                        plaintiffs and providing a period of repose after which dissolved corporations may distribute remaining assets free of all claims and shareholders may receive them secure in the knowledge that they may not be reclaimed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Directors must generally discharge or make provision for discharging all of the corporation's liabilities before distributing the remaining assets to the shareholders. See the Official Comment to section 14.06. But section 14.07 does not contemplate that
                        liquidating distributions to shareholders will be deferred until all possible claims are barred under section 14.07. Many claims covered by this section are of a type for which provision may be made by the purchase of insurance
                        or by the setting aside of a portion of the assets, thereby permitting prompt distributions in liquidation. Claimants, of course, may always have recourse to the remaining assets of the dissolved corporation. See section 14.07(d)(1).
                        Further, where unexpected claims arise after distributions have been made to shareholders in liquidation, section 14.07(d)(2) authorizes recovery against the shareholders receiving the earlier distributions. The recovery, however,
                        is limited to the smaller of the recipient shareholder's pro rata share of the claim or the total amount of assets received as liquidating distributions by the shareholder from the corporation. The provision ensures that claimants
                        seeking to recover distributions from shareholders will try to recover from the entire class of shareholders rather than concentrating only on the larger shareholders and protects the limited liability of shareholders.

                    This section contains the substance of subsection 14.07(d) of the Model Act and was added for the purpose of setting forth provisions applicable to claims covered by either <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a14s55-14-06" target="_self">G.S. 55-14-06</a></cite>                    or <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a14s55-14-07" target="_self">G.S. 55-14-07</a></cite>. The language of the Model Act was modified in subdivision (a)(1) to make clear that undistributed assets of a dissolved corporation include coverage
                    under any applicable insurance policy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under subdivision (a)(2), a claim may be enforced against a shareholder to the extent of the lesser of his pro rata share thereof or the corporate assets distributed to him in liquidation. In no event may a shareholder's total liability under this section
                    exceed the total amount of assets distributed to him in liquidation. This subdivision, unlike former G.S. 55-54, makes a shareholder liable regardless of whether the distribution to him was made at a time when the corporation was unable
                    to meet its obligations and regardless of whether he knew that the distribution violated this Act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This section does not bring forward the provision in former G.S. 55-32(1) allowing creditors to enforce certain specified statutory liabilities in direct actions against directors. However, substantially the same relief should be available to creditors
                    in insolvency proceedings and through attachment or similar procedures.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>

                    <p>
                        Involuntary dissolution in earlier versions of the Model Act required judicial order upon suit filed by the state attorney general. In the comment to section 95 of the 1969 Model Act, this decision was explained on the basis that the Model Act "provides
                        for judicial review in protection of rights that might otherwise be lost." This position, however, was not generally accepted - in 1982 only three jurisdictions limited involuntary dissolution to judicial action - with all other
                        jurisdictions permitting administrative dissolution for a variety of reasons, usually including a failure to pay franchise taxes and often including failure to file annual reports or otherwise comply with similar requirements of
                        the corporation statutes. Some of these administrative dissolution statutes appear in the tax statutes rather than the corporation statutes of the states.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The experience in most states has been that administrative dissolution, or the threat thereof, is an effective enforcement mechanism for a variety of statutory obligations. Judicial dissolution is inappropriate for many of these violations because of
                        its cost and the diversion of limited legal resources, particularly since most violations reflect the abandonment of the corporation by its owners.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The advantages of administrative dissolution in these circumstances are compelling: it not only reduces the number of records maintained by the secretary of state, but also avoids further wasteful attempts to compel compliance by the abandoned corporations
                        and returns the corporate name promptly to the status of available names. Therefore, the revised Model Act includes, in sections 14.20 through 14.23, a model provision for the administrative dissolution of corporations in certain
                        limited circumstances. These circumstances are set forth in section 14.20 and closely parallel provisions found in most state statutes on this subject.

                        The Model Act provides in subdivision 14.20(1) for administrative dissolution by the Secretary of State upon nonpayment of any taxes or penalties imposed by law, including franchise taxes. This provision conflicts with the provisions of
                        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia09s105-230" target="_blank">G.S. 105-230</a></cite> through 105-232, which empower the Secretary of Revenue to cancel a corporate franchise for nonpayment of taxes.
                        Accordingly the scope of subdivision (1) of this Act is restricted to failure to pay penalties, fees, or other payments due under this Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subdivision (5) provides for administrative dissolution upon expiration of the period of duration stated in the corporation's articles of incorporation. Under former G.S. 55-115, a corporation that continued to conduct business after the expiration of
                        its period of duration could at any time amend its charter to extend or perpetuate its period of existence. This provision was not brought forward.

                    <p>
                        Many failures to comply with statutory requirements that may give rise to administrative dissolution under section 14.20 occur because of oversight or inadvertence by responsible corporate officers of corporations that are continuing in business. Such
                        failures are usually corrected promptly when brought to the corporation's attention. Sections 14.21(a) and (b) therefore provide a mandatory notice by the secretary of state to each corporation subject to administrative dissolution
                        and a 60-day grace period following the notice before the certificate of administrative dissolution may be filed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In most instances, the issue whether the corporation is subject to administrative dissolution will not be controverted. If a corporation is administratively dissolved, it may petition the secretary of state for reinstatement under section 14.22 and, if
                        this is denied, it may appeal to the courts under section 14.23.

                        Section 14.22 provides a two-year period during which a corporation may seek reinstatement following administrative dissolution. This section may apply when a corporation through inadvertence or a failure to maintain a registered agent fails to receive
                        or respond to the predissolution notice of default required by section 14.21. A corporation that is reinstated pursuant to this section resumes carrying on its business as before dissolution.

                    <p>
                        In order to be eligible for reinstatement, a corporation must comply with all statutory requirements at the time it seeks reinstatement. It must establish, for example, that all taxes have been paid and that its name is available when it files the application
                        for reinstatement.

                        Section 14.30 provides grounds for the judicial dissolution of corporations at the request of the state, a shareholder, a creditor, or a corporation which has commenced voluntary dissolution. This section states that a court "may" order dissolution if
                        a ground for dissolution exists. Thus there is discretion on the part of the court as to whether dissolution is appropriate even though grounds exist under the specific circumstances.

                    <p>
                        Section 14.30(1) preserves longstanding and traditional provisions authorizing the state to seek to dissolve involuntarily a corporation by judicial decree. While this power has been exercised only rarely in recent years, this right of the state involves
                        a policing action that provides a means by which the state may ensure compliance with, and nonabuse of, the fundamentals of corporate existence. Section 14.30(1) limits the power of the state in this regard to grounds that are
                        reasonably related to this objective.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The legality of proposed corporations or of proposed actions has sometimes been tested by the secretary of state's refusal to accept documents for filing. The role of the secretary of state in reviewing documents for filing has been restricted by the
                        Model Act (see section 1.25 and its Official Comment). It is intended that suits under this subchapter will replace those actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 14.31(2) provides for involuntary dissolution at the suit of a shareholder under circumstances involving deadlock or significant abuse of power by controlling shareholders or directors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dissolution because of deadlock is available if there is a deadlock at the directors' level but only if (1) the shareholders are unable to break the deadlock and (2) either "irreparable injury" to the corporation is being threatened or suffered or the
                        business and affairs "can no longer be conducted to the advantage of " the shareholders. This language closely follows the earlier versions of the Model Act except that the requirement of "irreparable injury" has been relaxed to
                        some extent. Dissolution because of deadlock at the directors' level is not dependent on the lapse of time during which the deadlock continues.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Dissolution is also available because of deadlock at the shareholders' level if the shareholders are unable to elect directors over a two-year period. This remedy is particularly important in small or family-held corporations in which share ownership
                        may be divided on a 50-50 basis or a super majority provision (including possibly a requirement of unanimity) may effectively prevent the election of any directors. Dissolution under section 14.30(2)(iii) is not dependent on irreparable
                        injury or misconduct by the directors then in office; if injury or misconduct is present, a deadlocked shareholder may proceed under another clause of section 14.30(2).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A shareholder may sue for involuntary dissolution upon proof either that those in control of the corporation are acting illegally, oppressively, or fraudulently (section 14.30(2)(ii)) or that the corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted (section
                        14.30(2)(iv)). The application of these grounds for dissolution to specific circumstances obviously involves judicial discretion in the application of a general standard to concrete circumstances. The court should be cautious in
                        the application of these grounds so as to limit them to genuine abuse rather than instances of acceptable tactics in a power struggle for control of a corporation.

                        Creditors may obtain involuntary dissolution only when the corporation is insolvent and only in the limited circumstances set forth in section 14.30(3). Typically, a proceeding under the federal Bankruptcy Act is an alternative in these situations.

                        A corporation that has commenced voluntary dissolution may petition a court to supervise its dissolution. Such an action may be appropriate to permit the orderly liquidation of the corporate assets and to protect the corporation from a multitude of creditors'
                        suits or suits by dissatisfied shareholders.

                        Under former G.S. 55-125(a)(2), a deadlock resulting from special provisions or arrangements designed to create veto power among shareholders was not grounds for judicial dissolution. Under subdivision (2) of this section, deadlock is grounds for dissolution,
                        even if it results from special provisions or arrangements.

                        Clause (ii) of subdivision (2), brought forward from former G.S. 55-125(a)(4), is substituted for the Model Act's standard of "illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent" conduct.

                        Clause (v) of subdivision (2), brought forward from former G.S. 55-125(a)(3), is added to the Model Act's provisions to make agreements to liquidate specifically enforceable.

                        Finding Required Under Former G.S. 55-125(a)(1). - Under former G.S. 55-125(a)(1), irreconcilable deadlock of the directorate or shareholders was not sufficient basis for an order of liquidation without a supported finding or conclusion that the shareholders
                        were so deadlocked that its business could no longer be conducted with advantage to all the shareholders. Ellis v. Civic Imp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 42, 209 S.E.2d 873 (1974), cert.

                        Deadlock in Management of Corporate Affairs. - Where plaintiff and defendant were the only directors, because they could not agree when the corporation should borrow money, the corporation could not borrow money at all; therefore, there was sufficient
                        evidence to support a finding of deadlock in the management of the corporation's affairs. Foster v. Foster Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 436 S.E.2d 843 (1993).

                        Showing Required Under Former G.S. 55-125(a)(4). - When the power of the court in the exercise of its equitable jurisdiction was invoked to liquidate and decree involuntary dissolution under former G.S. 55-125(a)(4), there had to be a showing that the
                        liquidation was reasonably necessary for the protection of the rights or interests of the complaining shareholder. Dowd v. Charlotte Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 101</cite>, 139

                        corporation had been operating at a loss and that to allow it to continue operations would deplete its assets and seriously damage the stockholders. Royall v. Carr Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 735</cite>,

                        Trial court adequately protected a terminated corporate director's reasonable expectations as a complaining shareholder because the court awarded the director, pursuant to the provisions of the stockholders' agreement between the parties, a designated

                        Corporation Is the Necessary Defendant. - The necessary defendant in an action for involuntary dissolution of a corporation under the statute is the corporation itself; shareholders and directors may, but need not be, made parties defendant unless relief
                        is sought against them personally. W &amp; H Graphics, Inc. v. Hamby, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 82, 268 S.E.2d 567 (1980).

                        Directors Are Proper Parties to Shareholder's Suit. - Directors are proper parties to a suit to dissolve the corporation upon the complaint of one shareholder, even though no relief is sought against them personally. Dowd v. Charlotte Pipe &amp; Foundry

                        They May Be Joined or Become Parties on Own Application. - The implication in the statute is that directors and other interested shareholders may be made, or, on their own application, may become parties to a complaining shareholder's action to liquidate
                        and dissolve the corporation. Certainly, the directors are not improper parties. Dowd v. Charlotte Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 101</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 10 (1964).

                        Joinder of Suit for Failure to Declare Dividends with Cause of Action for Liquidation. - A stockholder in a corporation may sue the corporation, and join its directors as defendants, for failure to declare adequate dividends from the corporation's earnings,
                        and may join therewith a second cause of action for liquidation and involuntary dissolution of the corporation based upon bad faith management in suppressing dividends and in deflating the value of the corporation's assets, thus
                        precluding the plaintiff stockholder from obtaining either a fair dividend or a fair market for his stock. Dowd v. Charlotte Pipe &amp; Foundry Co., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 101</cite>, 139 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Discretion in Grant of Relief. - When a shareholder brought suit seeking relief under former G.S. 55-125(a)(4) and G.S. 55-125.1, he had the burden of proving that his "rights or interests" as a shareholder were being contravened. However, once the shareholder
                        had established this, the trial court, in deciding whether to grant relief, had to exercise its equitable discretion, and consider the actual benefit and injury to all of the shareholders resulting from dissolution or other possible
                        relief. To hold otherwise would allow a plaintiff to demand at-will dissolution of a corporation or a forced buy-out of his shares or other relief at the expense of the corporation and without regard to the rights and interests
                        of the other shareholders. Meiselman v. Meiselman, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 279</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 551 (1982).

                        The determination of relief, liquidation or otherwise, is within the superior court's equitable discretion. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 330 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 541</cite>,

                        Involuntary dissolution under former G.S. 55-125 was not the exclusive remedy in this State, because under former G.S. 55-125.1 the court had broad discretion to grant any kind of relief it deemed appropriate as an alternative to dissolving a corporation.

                        Need for Judicial Intervention Determined Case-by-Case. - The circumstances which give rise to relief under the involuntary dissolution statutes are so infinitely varied that courts must determine if judicial intervention is necessary on a case-by-case
                        basis. Meiselman v. Meiselman, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 758, 295 S.E.2d 249 (1982), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 279</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 551 (1983).

                        In a determination of whether to order dissolution or other relief under former G.S. 55-125(a)(4), the complaining shareholder had to show that: (1) He had one or more substantial reasonable expectations known or assumed by the other participants; (2)
                        the expectation has been frustrated; (3) the frustration was not the shareholder's fault and was in large part beyond his control; and (4) under all of the circumstances of the case, the shareholder was entitled to some form of
                        equitable relief. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 330 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 541</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 19 (1985).

                        Order of Dissolution Upheld. - The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering dissolution of a closely-held corporation where the reasonable expectations of a minority shareholder and former vice-president with 38% of the shares, that he would
                        receive fair market value for his shares after his company compensation was cut off, and of his grandson, that he would have a share in the management of the company after he was elected director, were frustrated by the majority
                        shareholders, did not result from any fault of their own, and only judicial dissolution could safeguard those expectations. Royals v. Piedmont Elec. Repair Co., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite>                        700, 529 S.E.2d 515 (2000).

                        Insufficient Grounds for Dissolution. - Where the trial court failed to make any of the findings required under Meiselman v. Meiselman, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 279</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 551 (1983), but simply found that liquidation
                        was reasonably necessary for the protection of the interests of the complaining shareholder, the trial court's findings of fact were not sufficient to support its conclusion that grounds for dissolution existed. Foster v. Foster
                        Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 436 S.E.2d 843 (1993).

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly concluded that a decree of judicial dissolution of a corporation was not justified where a shareholder had received substantial dividends, dissolution would have harmed the rights and interests of the other shareholders, and nothing
                        prevented the shareholder form selling her shares or interest. Brady v. Van Vlaanderen, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 819 S.E.2d 561 (2018), review denied, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 83 (2019).

                        by the other shareholders and concurred in by them. High Point Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Sapona Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 713 S.E.2d 12 (2011).

                        Shareholder Need Only Show That "Fairness" Compels Dissolution. - Subdivision (a)(4) of former G.S. 55-125, which authorized liquidation, not when there was "oppression," but when it was reasonably necessary for the protection of the complaining shareholder,
                        required the complaining shareholder only to show that basic "fairness" compelled dissolution. Meiselman v. Meiselman, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 758, 295 S.E.2d 249 (1982), modified and aff'd,

                        Order of Liquidation and Dissolution Upheld. - It was reasonable for the court to conclude that the complaining shareholder, who began working for corporation in 1955 and worked continuously until he was abruptly fired in 1978, had a reasonable expectation
                        that his employment would continue. Since the controlling officer-director misappropriated corporate opportunities, and since the majority of the stockholders aligned themselves with this officer-director, the court did not abuse
                        its discretion in ordering liquidation and dissolution. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 330 S.E.2d 649, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 541</cite>,

                        Section 14.32 preserves provisions from earlier versions of the Model Act authorizing the appointment of a receiver, and adds authority to appoint a custodian as an alternative, for a corporation in a judicial dissolution proceeding. In many states, general
                        statutes or rules of court regulate the appointment of receivers or custodians and define their duties. Section 14.32 is designed to supplement these general provisions and grant the court power to take the steps it considers necessary
                        to resolve the internal corporate problem or to effect liquidation of the corporation in an efficient manner.

                        A court decree ordering that a corporation be dissolved involuntarily has the same legal effect as articles of dissolution. Section 14.33 requires that the secretary of state receive and file a copy of the decree. Thereafter the corporation's business
                        and affairs are to be wound up as provided in sections 14.05, 14.06, and 14.07.

                        Section 14.40 is a deposit provision, not an escheat provision. It does not provide for ultimate disposition of unclaimed funds. Rather, it permits a corporation that has dissolved to pay over for safekeeping to the state treasurer (or other appropriate
                        state official with statutory authority to receive such funds) funds belonging to a creditor, claimant, or shareholder who cannot be found.

                    <p>
                        The handling and ultimate disposition of unclaimed funds by the state treasurer or other appropriate state official is to be determined by state law other than the Model Act.

                    <p>
                        A state may prescribe the terms and conditions upon which a foreign corporation is permitted to transact business within the state, subject, of course, to the restrictions of the United States Constitution. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15</a></cite>                        requires that a foreign corporation seeking to transact business within the state must (1) obtain a certificate of authority from the secretary of state and (2) maintain a registered office and appoint a registered agent within
                        the state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.01(a) states the basic requirement that a foreign corporation must obtain a certificate of authority before it transacts business within the state. Section 15.05 describes the scope of the privilege obtained by a certificate of authority while
                        section 15.02 describes the consequences of transacting business in the state without first obtaining the certificate of authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Model Act does not attempt to formulate an inclusive definition of what constitutes the transaction of business. Rather, the concept is defined in a negative fashion by section 15.01(b), which states that certain activities do
                        <i>
        not
       </i> constitute the transaction of business. In general terms, any conduct more regular, systematic, or extensive than that described in section 15.01(b) constitutes the transaction of business and requires the corporation
                        to obtain a certificate of authority. Typical conduct requiring a certificate of authority includes maintaining an office to conduct local intrastate business, selling personal property not in interstate commerce, entering into
                        contracts relating to the local business or sales, and owning or using real estate for general corporate purposes. But the passive owning of real estate for investment purposes does not constitute transacting business. See section
                        15.01(b)(9).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The test of "transacting business" defined in a negative way in section 15.01(b) applies only to the question whether the corporation's contacts with the state are such that it must obtain a certificate of authority. It is not applicable to other questions
                        such as whether the corporation is amenable to service of process under state "long-arm" statutes or liable for state or local taxes. A corporation that has obtained (or is required to obtain) a certificate of authority to transact
                        business under chapter 15 will generally be subject to suit and state taxation in the state, while a corporation that is subject to service of process or state taxation in a state will not necessarily be required to obtain a certificate
                        of authority under chapter 15.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The list of activities set forth in section 15.01(b) is not exhaustive. See section 15.01(c). The list excludes several different types of activities from the definition of "transacting business," which are discussed below.

                        Section 15.01(b)(1) excludes "maintaining, defending or settling any proceeding." The word "proceeding" is defined in section 1.40 to include all civil, criminal, administrative, or investigative suits or actions. Thus, a corporation is not "transacting
                        business" solely because it resorts to the courts of the state to recover an indebtedness, enforce an obligation, recover possession of personal property, obtain the appointment of a receiver, intervene in a pending proceeding,
                        bring a petition to compel arbitration, file an appeal bond, or pursue appellate remedies. Similarly, a foreign corporation is not required to obtain a certificate of authority merely because it files a complaint with the state
                        securities commission or other governmental agency or participates in an administrative proceeding within the state.

                        A corporation does not "transact business" within a state under section 15.01 merely because some of its internal affairs occur within a state. Thus, a corporation may hold meetings of its board of directors or shareholders within a state without first
                        obtaining a certificate of authority (section 15.01(b)(2)). It also may maintain offices or agencies within a state relating solely to the transfer, registration, or exchange of its shares without obtaining a certificate of authority
                        (section 15.01(b)(4)). Other activities relating to the internal affairs of the corporation that do not constitute the transaction of business under section 15.01(b) include having officers or representatives of a corporation who
                        reside within or are physically present in the state; while there, the officers or representatives may make executive decisions relating to the affairs of the corporation without imposing on the corporation the requirement that
                        it obtain a certificate of authority in the state, provided these activities are not so regular and systematic as to cause the residence to be viewed as a business office.

                        A foreign corporation may maintain a bank account with a bank within the state, make deposits and write checks on the account without obtaining a certificate of authority (section 15.01(b)(3)).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A corporation is not "transacting business" within the meaning of section 15.01(a) if it is transacting business in interstate commerce (section 15.01(b)(10)) or soliciting or obtaining orders that must be accepted outside the state before they become
                        contracts (section 15.01(b)(6)). These limitations reflect the provisions of the United States Constitution that grant to the United States Congress exclusive power over interstate commerce, and preclude states from imposing restrictions
                        or conditions upon this commerce. These sections should be construed in a manner consistent with judicial decisions under the United States Constitution. Under these decisions, a foreign corporation is not required to obtain a
                        certificate of authority even though it sells goods within the state if they are shipped to the purchasers in interstate commerce. A corporation need not obtain a certificate of authority even if it also does work and performs
                        acts within the state incidental to the interstate business, e.g., if it takes or enforces a security interest incidental to these transactions. Nor is it required to obtain a certificate of authority merely because it sends traveling
                        salesmen or solicitors into a state so long as contracts are not made within the state. Similarly, an office may be maintained by a corporation in a state without obtaining a certificate of authority if the office's functions relate
                        solely to interstate commerce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Purchases of goods may of course be in interstate commerce as readily as sales. Thus, the purchase of personal property by a foreign corporation for shipment in interstate commerce out of the state does not require the corporation to obtain a certificate
                        of authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A foreign corporation does not need to obtain a certificate of authority if it sells goods in the state through independent contractors (section 15.01(b)(5)). These transactions are viewed as transactions by the independent contractors, not by the corporation
                        itself, even though the corporation sets some limits or ground rules for its contractors. If these controls are sufficiently pervasive, however, the corporation may be deemed to be selling for itself in intrastate commerce, and
                        not through the independent contractors, and therefore engaged in the transaction of business in the state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mere act of making a loan by a foreign corporation that is not in the business of making loans does not constitute transacting business in the state in which the loan is made. On the same theory a foreign corporation may obtain security for the repayment
                        of a loan, and foreclose or enforce the lien or security interest to collect the loan, without being deemed to be transacting business. See section 15.01(b)(7) and (8). Similarly, a refunding or "roll over" of a loan or its adjustment
                        or compromise does not involve the transaction of business.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept of "transacting business" involves regular, repeated, and continuing business contacts of a local nature. A single agreement or isolated transaction within a state does not constitute the transaction of business if there is no intention to
                        repeat the transaction or engage in similar transactions. Since the question is entirely one of fact, section 15.01(b)(10) retains the partially objective test from earlier versions of the Model Act that a transaction completed
                        within 30 days does not constitute "transacting business" if it is not one in the course of "repeated transactions of a like nature." A continuing transaction that is not completed within 30 days will likely require obtaining a
                        certificate of authority, whether or not it is one of a number of repeated transactions, but that issue is not addressed by the Model Act. The 30-day provision is, in other words, a "safe harbor" for not requiring a certificate
                        of authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.01(c) makes clear that the list of transactions in section 15.01(b) is not exhaustive. Among the large number of other transactions which do not give rise to the requirement that a certificate of authority be obtained are the ownership of all
                        the shares of stock in a corporation that is engaged in local business within the state or as a limited partner in a limited partnership engaged in local business, or taking ministerial actions such as filing financing statements
                        or registering trademarks.

                        The activities listed in the Model Act as not constituting the transaction of business appear to be narrower in certain respects than the activities listed in former G.S. 55-131(b). Subsection (b), which applies solely for purposes of this Act and not
                        for purposes of determining whether there is
                        <i>

                        Model Act's text in subsection 15.01(c) unnecessary, and it was omitted.

                            The phrase "doing business in this State" is not susceptible of an all embracing definition, and each case must be decided upon the particular facts therein appearing, the general criteria being that a foreign corporation is doing business in this State
                            if it transacts in this State the business it was created and authorized to do, through representatives in this State, and thus is present in this State through the person of its representatives. Parris v. H.G. Fischer &amp;

                            What Constitutes Within the State. - A foreign corporation cannot be held to be doing business in a state, and therefore subject to its laws, unless it shall be found as a fact that such corporation has entered the state in which it is alleged to be doing
                            business and there transacted, by its officers, agents or other persons authorized to act for it, the business in which it is authorized to engage by the state under whose laws it was created and organized. The presence within
                            the state of such officers, agents or other persons, engaged in the transaction of the corporation's business with citizens of the state, is generally held as determinative of the question as to whether the corporation is doing

                            or the corporation's internal affairs. Thus, the corporation was not transacting business in North Carolina. Harbin Yinhai Tech. v. Greentree Fin. Group, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 615, 677 S.E.2d 854

                            such importation, whether it be of goods, persons or information, is a transaction of interstate commerce. Snelling &amp; Snelling, Inc. v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 193,

                            in this State consisted of: (1) soliciting franchise agreements and promoting sales of its business forms, (2) training and instructing its franchisees and inspecting the premises, books and records of its franchisees, and
                            (3) controlling the business methods of its franchisees to protect its service mark and to ensure an accurate accounting of profits by its franchisees, plaintiff was transacting business in interstate commerce and was not required
                            to obtain a certificate of authority from the Secretary of State as a prerequisite to bringing suit in this State, since plaintiff's activities were incidental to its interstate franchise contracts and were, therefore, interstate

                            Neither Property Nor Situs of Debts Removed to State. - The statute requiring "domestication" enables a plaintiff to get personal service upon a foreign corporation, but does not remove its property to the State nor the situs of its debts created elsewhere.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of section 15.02 is to induce corporations that are required to obtain a certificate of authority but have not to qualify promptly, without imposing harsh or erratic sanctions. The Model Act rejects the provisions adopted in a few states that
                        make unenforceable intrastate transactions by unqualified corporations or that impose punitive sanctions or forfeitures on nonqualifying corporations. Often the failure to qualify is a result of inadvertance or bona fide disagreement
                        as to the scope of the provisions of section 15.01, which are necessarily imprecise; the imposition of harsh sanctions in these situations is inappropriate. Further, as a matter of state policy it is generally preferable to encourage
                        qualification in case of doubt rather than to impose severe sanctions that may cause corporations to resist obtaining a certificate of authority in doubtful situations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.02 closes the courts of the state to suits maintained by corporations which should have but which have not obtained a certificate of authority. However, this sanction is not a punitive one: section 15.02(e) states that the failure of the corporation
                        to qualify does not affect the validity of corporate acts, including contracts. Thus, a contract made by a nonqualified corporation may be enforced by the corporation simply by obtaining a certificate. Further, section 15.02(c)
                        authorizes a court to stay a proceeding to determine whether a corporation should have qualified to transact business and, if it concludes that qualification is necessary, it may grant a further stay to permit the corporation to
                        do so. Thus, the corporation will not be compelled to refile a suit if the corporation qualifies to transact business within a reasonable period. The purpose of these provisions is to encourage corporations to obtain certificates
                        of authority and to eliminate the temptation to raise section 15.02 defenses only after applicable statutes of limitation have run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.02(e) does not prevent a foreign corporation that has failed to obtain a certificate of authority from "defending any proceeding." The distinction between "maintaining" a proceeding under section 15.02(a) and "defending any proceeding" under
                        section 15.02(e) is determined on the basis of whether affirmative relief is sought. A nonqualified corporation may interpose any defense or permissive or mandatory counterclaim to defeat a claimed recovery, but may not obtain
                        an affirmative judgment or decree based on the counterclaim unless it has obtained a certificate of authority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to closing the courts of the state to a nonqualified foreign corporation, many states impose a penalty equal to all fees and franchise taxes that the foreign corporation would have been liable for if it had qualified to transact business when
                        it was first required to do so. This penalty is usually defined to equal the sum of fees and franchise taxes for each year or part thereof the corporation transacted business in the state without a certificate of authority. Similar
                        provisions appeared in earlier versions of the Model Act, but were modified in the present revision in favor of a specific dollar amount (which each state adopting the revised Model Act should insert in section 15.02(d) for each
                        day and year the foreign corporation fails to qualify. The revised Model Act does not treat liability for taxes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.02(b) prevents evasion of section 15.02(a) by an assignment of a claim on which the foreign corporation is barred from bringing suit under section 15.02(a). If the successor has acquired all or substantially all of the assets of the foreign
                        corporation, the successor may maintain suit after it has qualified. In the case of all other assignments, the foreign corporation itself must obtain a certificate of authority before the assignee may maintain suit on the claim.
                        The phrase "all or substantially all" has the meaning set forth in the Official Comment to section 12.01.

                        penalty.

                        Contracts Not Avoided by Noncompliance. - The contracts of a foreign corporation doing business in this State without compliance with the statute as to domestication are not avoided; the penalty alone is enforceable by action as the statute prescribes.

                        Effect of Suspension of Certificate of Authority on Corporation's Capacity to Sue. - Construction company, which entered into a contract with defendant-homeowner and performed that contract at a time when its certificate of authority was in a state of
                        suspension, could not assert or enforce its rights under the contract, including claims based in equity (i.e., claims based on quantum meruit). Ben Johnson Homes, Inc. v.

                        the Attorney General was not a real party defendant, but, being charged with the enforcement of the statute, he should be retained as a nominal defendant along with the Secretary of State where the constitutionality of the statute

                            The application for a certificate of authority
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.03 provides that a foreign corporation seeking a certificate of authority to transact business in the state must file an application that contains the information set forth in this section. These disclosure requirements are supplemented by
                        the requirements of other sections in this chapter - 15.04, 15.06, and 15.07 - which require amended or supplemental filings in certain circumstances, and by section 16.22, which requires every qualified foreign corporation to
                        file annual reports containing specified information. Generally, the revised Model Act eliminates repetitious filings, so that information need be submitted to the secretary of state in only one document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purposes of these disclosure requirements are: (1) to ensure that citizens of the state have adequate information about foreign corporations in their transactions with them; (2) to put them in a status of equality with domestic corporations with respect
                        to information required to be furnished; (3) to facilitate their subjection to the jurisdiction of the state's courts, thereby removing any disadvantage citizens of the state may have when dealing with them; and (4) to provide
                        readily accessible evidence of their existence. Other statutes relating to franchise taxes and regulatory matters may require a qualified foreign corporation to provide additional information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The information required to be included in the application for a certificate of authority by section 15.03 is the minimum needed to administer the filing requirements of the Model Act. The application must also be accompanied by a certificate of existence
                        and the filing fee required by section 1.22. A corporation that qualifies to transact business in a state must comply with the requirements of other statutes, including franchise tax and similar statutes. See section 15.05.

                    <p>
                        This Act does not bring forward the requirement of former G.S. 55-138(a) that a foreign corporation include in its application the purposes it desires to pursue in this State and information with respect to its capital structure. In addition, the application
                        under this Act is submitted with a certificate of existence or good standing rather than the certified charter documents required under former G.S. 55-138.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subsection (a) was modified to conform to changes from the Model Act in the address requirement made in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a02s55-2-02" target="_self">G.S. 55-2-02</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a05s55-5-02" target="_self">G.S. 55-5-02</a></cite>.

                        Subsection (c) brings forward former G.S. 55-139(b) because the Model Act contains no express requirement that the Secretary of State issue a certificate of authority.

                        Section 15.04 requires a foreign corporation to obtain an amended certificate of authority if it changes its corporate name, its duration, or the state or country of its incorporation. An amendment is not necessary to reflect changes in its principal
                        office address or in its current officers or directors since that information is supplied in the annual report. In addition, section 15.07 requires an immediate filing if the foreign corporation changes its registered office or
                        registered agent within the state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other fundamental changes by a foreign corporation do not require amendments to the certificate of authority. The secretary of state will be advised of most of these changes through the annual report. See section 16.22. Thus, a person seeking to obtain
                        current information about a foreign corporation should examine the annual reports of the corporation as well as the application for certificate of authority and amendments to it. This procedure of requiring most changes to be reported
                        in the annual reports rather than as amendments to the certificate of authority should eliminate many unnecessary filings with the secretary of state without reducing the information available through the secretary of state's office.

                    <p>
                        A certificate of authority authorizes a foreign corporation to transact business in the state subject to the right of the state to revoke the certificate. The privileges of this status are defined in section 15.05(b): a qualified foreign corporation has
                        the same (but no greater) privileges as a domestic corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.05(b), by granting to qualified foreign corporations all of the rights and privileges enjoyed by a domestic corporation, avoids discrimination that might otherwise be subject to constitutional challenge. On the other hand, section 15.05(b)
                        also contains a restriction or limitation: a qualified foreign corporation is subject to the same restrictions as a domestic corporation, including the same duties, penalties, and liabilities. This latter aspect of section 15.05(b)
                        has declined in importance as states have eliminated unnecessary or outdated restrictions on domestic corporations and, as a consequence of section 15.05(b), on qualified foreign corporations as well. In particular, section 15.05(b)
                        makes section 3.01 (corporate purposes) applicable to a qualified foreign corporation, and grants substantially the same powers to it as are possessed by a domestic corporation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 15.05(c) preserves the judicially developed doctrine that internal corporate affairs are governed by the state of incorporation even when the corporation's business and assets are located primarily in other states.

                        A foreign corporation that obtains a certificate of authority in a state thereby agrees that it is amenable to suit in the state. Section 15.07 requires every such corporation continuously to maintain a registered office and registered agent within the
                        state upon whom service of process may be made. As is the case with a domestic corporation, the registered office may, but need not be, a business office of the foreign corporation.

                        Section 15.07 is patterned after section 5.01, relating to the registered office and registered agent of a domestic corporation. For a fuller description of the policies underlying section 15.07, see the Official Comment to section 5.01.

                    <p>
                        A foreign corporation that ceases to transact business within a state may withdraw from the state only by obtaining a certificate of withdrawal. A foreign corporation that ceases to transact business in the state but fails to obtain a certificate of withdrawal
                        will continue to be (1) subject to service of process on its registered agent or on its secretary pursuant to section 15.10 and (2) liable for franchise and other taxes under other statutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The certificate of withdrawal provided by this section is recognition by the state that the foreign corporation has ceased to transact business in the state.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The application for certificate of withdrawal must appoint the secretary of state as the withdrawing corporation's agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time it was authorized to transact business
                        in the state. The application must also set forth a mailing address to which the secretary of state may forward any process received, and the corporation must agree to notify the secretary of state of any change in that address.
                        There is no time limit on the obligation to advise the secretary of state of changes of mailing address. To ensure that the appointment of the secretary of state is unqualified and meets the precise requirements of this section,
                        the secretary of state may require that an application for certificate of withdrawal be on a form prescribed by him. See section 1.21.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Service of process on the secretary of state pursuant to the statements in the application for certificate of withdrawal effects service on the corporation under section 15.20(c). The secretary of state must then mail the process to the corporation at
                        the mailing address specified in the application or in a subsequent communication to the secretary of state advising him of a change in mailing address.

                        This section modifies the Model Act in subdivision (b)(3) to clarify and limit the circumstances under which service of process on the Secretary of State is effective with respect to a foreign corporation that has withdrawn from this State. In addition,
                        former G.S. 55-150(d), modified to conform to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55a15s55-15-03ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 55-15-03(c)</a></cite>, was added as subsection (b1), because the Model Act contains no

                        Section 15.30 authorizes the administrative revocation of the certificate of authority of a foreign corporation on the grounds specified. Administrative revocation is effective only upon compliance with the procedure specified in section 15.31. A foreign
                        corporation that believes the administrative revocation is unwarranted may obtain judicial review of the secretary of state's determination pursuant to section 15.32.

                    <p>
                        If a qualified foreign corporation has dissolved or merged into another corporation, the secretary of state may proceed to revoke its certificate of authority to transact business solely on the basis of a certificate from the secretary of state or other
                        official of the state of incorporation. Section 15.30(6). This subdivision provides a simple and inexpensive method to eliminate the names of corporations that are no longer in existence from the records of the secretary of state,
                        thereby making available the corporate names for use by other entities.

                        Section 15.30 is patterned after section 14.20, relating to the administrative dissolution of domestic corporations. See the Official Comment to section 14.20 for a fuller description of the policies underlying section 15.30.

                    <p>
                        The procedure for revocation of a certificate of authority in section 15.31 establishes a simple method of completing the revocation while at the same time ensuring that the foreign corporation is advised of the contemplated action and has an opportunity
                        to contest it in appropriate situations. In most situations, revocation by the secretary of state will not be contested.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After revocation, the secretary of state is appointed the foreign corporation's agent for service of process; upon receipt of service, the secretary of state must forward the process to the foreign corporation's principal address, as last reflected in
                        his records. Revocation, however, does not of itself terminate the authority of the foreign corporation's registered agent, so that process served on that agent by a third person who was unaware of the revocation may be effective.

                        A corporation whose certificate of authority is revoked may obtain judicial review of the revocation decision. In the review proceeding the court may summarily order the secretary of state to reinstate the corporation or take other action it deems appropriate.

                        Section 16.01 describes in general terms the records every corporation must keep or maintain, the form in which they may be maintained, and, to a limited extent, where the records must be kept.

                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.01(a) requires a corporation to "keep" as permanent records the minutes of meetings of its shareholders and board of directors, and a record of actions taken by unanimous consent by its shareholders or board of directors. In addition, each
                        corporation must "keep" a record of all actions taken by a committee of the board of directors when acting on behalf of the board of directors for the corporation; this includes, for example, action taken by an executive committee
                        between meetings of the board and final action of a special litigation committee authorized to act on behalf of the board. Section 16.01(a) does not require a record of actions taken by a committee when the committee is not acting
                        in place of the board of directors, e.g., when the committee is discussing policy and formulating recommendations for action by the board of directors. Also, it does not require either minutes or a record of committee deliberations
                        under any circumstances. Committee meetings are preserved as forums for open and frank discussion and discussion of sensitive corporate data without fear of recordation or disclosure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.01 also does not address the amount of detail that should appear in the minutes of meetings of shareholders or the board of directors - the content of minutes is largely fixed by tradition and no inference about their content should be drawn
                        from the section's treatment of the records of committee deliberation and action.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sections 16.01(b) and (c) require the corporation to "maintain" appropriate accounting and shareholder records. The word "maintain" is used to denote current records only and does not require the corporation to keep on hand as permanent records, data,
                        or information of historical interest only; the periods for which these records, data, or information should be kept is not addressed by the Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.01(b) relates to accounting records. The word "appropriate" is used to indicate that the nature of the financial records to be kept is dependent to some extent on the nature of the corporation's business; the phrase "adequate records" is used
                        in some state statutes to convey essentially the same meaning. "Appropriate" records are generally records that permit financial statements to be prepared which fairly present the financial position and transactions of the corporation.
                        In some very small businesses operating on a cash basis, however, "appropriate" accounting records may consist only of a check register, vouchers, and receipts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.01(c) requires the corporation to maintain such records of its shareholders as will permit it to compile a list of shareholders when required. These records may consist of stubs from which certificates have been detached in the case of corporations
                        with a few shareholders or of elaborate electronic data retrievable only by modern technology in the case of large, publicly held corporations. The record may be retained by the corporation or an agent, who traditionally is the
                        transfer agent but may be another agent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.01(d) generally authorizes corporations to retain records on microfilm, microfiche, computer memory or disc, or any other method that is convenient or appropriate under the circumstances. The basic requirement is that the method chosen must
                        be capable of reduction to written form within a reasonable time. In addition, in the case of the record of shareholders, the method must permit the development of an alphabetical list of shareholders of record as required by section
                        16.01(c).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.01(e) requires certain basic records to be kept at the principal office of the corporation, including minutes of shareholders' meetings for the preceding three years and records of shareholder action taken without a meeting during the same
                        period. This requirement is imposed because these records must be available for inspection by any shareholder at that office. See section 16.02(a). The "principal office" of the corporation is defined in section 1.40 to be the
                        location of the executive offices of the corporation and its address must be set forth by the corporation in its annual report required by section 16.22. The Model Act does not generally specify where records other than those described
                        in section 16.01(e) must be kept. They may be kept in one or more offices within or without the state; indeed, in the case of records kept in nonwritten form, it may be impossible to determine "where" they are located.

                        This section contains two changes from former G.S. 55-37 and 55-37.1. First, the section requires "appropriate" accounting records whereas prior law required that they be "correct and complete." Second, subsection (e), mandating the retention of certain
                        described records at the corporation's principal office, has no counterpart in prior law. Provision was made in subsection (a) for retaining records of incorporators, and the Model Act was modified in subdivision (e)(5) for clarity.

                        Separate Books Not Required for Stockholders and Government. - It is not logical to conclude that the legislature intended to require a corporation to keep two sets of books, one for its stockholders, and the other for the government, if it wished to
                        compute its taxes on a cash receipt basis. Watson v. Watson Seed Farms, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 238</cite>, 116 S.E.2d 716 (1961).

                        When Proceedings May Be Proved by Parol Testimony. - When it is shown that no minutes were made of a particular meeting, or that they are incomplete, the proceedings may be proved by parol testimony. S &amp; W Realty &amp; Bonded Com. Agency v. Duckworth

                        Mandamus to Require Disclosure of Names, Addresses and Holdings of Shareholders. - Shareholders in a building and loan association were entitled to a writ of mandamus, requiring the association and its officers to provide them an opportunity to inspect
                        the records of the association to ascertain the names, addresses, and number of shares held by each shareholder so that they might solicit proxies for use at shareholders' meetings. White v. Smith,

                        Whether Stock Actually Issued in Consideration for Covenant-Not-To-Compete and Other Agreements. - In a business dispute involving asserted allegations of breach of a covenant-not-to-compete and other claims, a trial court erred by granting defendants
                        summary judgment on the issue of whether there was consideration offered to defendants in exchange for signing the covenant-not-to-compete, confidentiality and non-solicitation agreement, and shareholders' agreement, as a genuine
                        issue of material fact remained as to whether plaintiff actually issued stock shares promised to defendants, such that they constituted valuable consideration to make the covenant-not-to-compete and confidentiality and non-solicitation
                        agreement valid and enforceable. Kinesis Adver., Inc. v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 652 S.E.2d 284 (2007), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 177</cite>,

                        Lack of Accountability to Other Shareholders. - Generally, a lack of accountability to other shareholders would not, by itself, be sufficient grounds to pierce the corporate veil, as former G.S. 55-37 and former G.S. 55-38 would provide an adequate remedy
                        at law to enforce accountability. Dorton v. Dorton, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 667, 336 S.E.2d 415 (1985).

                        Use in Evidence of Corporate Computer Records. - Former G.S. 55-37.1 was designed to give broad legislative approval to the use in evidence of corporate computer records. However, in declaring such computer records admissible in evidence, it did not deal
                        with the special problems of reliability created by the use of computers. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).

                    <p>
                        Former G.S. 55-37.1 authorized the admission of corporate computer records under appropriate safeguards deemed sufficient to render them trustworthy. But it did not, and was not designed to, preclude judicial development of workable standards for the
                        admission of computerized business records generally. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).

                        Conditions Under Which Printouts Are Admissible. - Printout cards or sheets of business records stored on electronic computing equipment are admissible in evidence, if otherwise relevant and material, if: (1) The computerized entries were made in the
                        regular course of business, (2) the entries were made at or near the time of the transaction involved, and (3) a proper foundation for such evidence is laid by testimony of a witness who is familiar with the computerized records
                        and the methods under which they were made so as to satisfy the court that the methods, the sources, of information, and the time of preparation render such evidence trustworthy. State v. Springer,

                        Failure to Lay Foundation for Admission. - Computer printout referred to in oral testimony is inadmissible where no foundation is laid for its admission and the printout itself is not offered in evidence. State v. Springer,

                        Section 16.02(c) follows earlier versions of the Model Act and permits inspection of the records described in section 16.02(b) by a shareholder only if his demand is made in good faith and for a "proper purpose." A "proper purpose" means a purpose that
                        is reasonably relevant to the demanding shareholder's interest as a shareholder. Some statutes do not use the phrase "proper purpose;" the Model Act continues to use it because it is traditional and well-understood language defining
                        the scope of the shareholder's right of inspection and its use ensures that the very substantial case law that has developed under it will continue to be applicable under the revised Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As a practical matter, a shareholder who alleges a purpose in general terms, such as a desire to determine the value of his shares, to communicate with fellow shareholders, or to determine whether improper transactions have occurred, has been held to
                        allege a "proper purpose." Section 16.02(c) thus attempts to require more meaningful statements of purpose, if feasible, by requiring that a shareholder designate "with reasonable particularity" his purpose and the records he desires
                        to inspect; the records demanded must also be "directly connected" with that purpose. If disputed by the corporation, the "connection" of the records to the shareholder's purpose may be determined by a court's in camera examination
                        of the records.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.02(d) states that the inspection rights granted by this chapter are inherent rights of shareholders and may not be abolished or limited by the articles of incorporation or bylaws; the subsection is based on CAL. CORP. CODE ANN.
                        <span class="s1">
        §
       </span> 1600(d) (West 1977). No inference of any kind should be drawn from this subsection as to whether other, unrelated sections of the Model Act may be modified by provisions in the articles of incorporation or bylaws.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.02(e) provides that the right of inspection granted by section 16.02 is an independent right of inspection that is not a substitute for or in derogation of rights of inspection that may exist (1) under section 7.20, to inspect the shareholders'
                        list following the establishment of a record date for a meeting; (2) as part of a right of discovery that exists in connection with litigation; and (3) as a "common law" right of inspection, if any is found to exist by a court,
                        to examine corporate records. Section 16.02(e) simply preserves whatever independent right of inspection exists under these sources and does not create or recognize any rights, either expressly or by implication.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.02(f) extends the inspection rights provided by section 16.02 to beneficial owners of shares held by a nominee or in a voting trust. It was added as a technical correction to the Revised Model Business Corporation Act in 1986.

                    <p>
                        This section differs from prior law in a number of respects:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The section also contains several modifications of the Model Act provisions:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (i) Subsection (b) of this section further restricts the inspection rights of shareholders of public corporations in a manner not found in the Model Act, by protecting from inspection the accounting records of such corporations and any other records the
                        disclosure of which the corporation determines in good faith would constitute material nonpublic information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (ii) Subsection (f) was modified to require that beneficial owners who wish to exercise inspection rights must have their ownership certified to the corporation by the record holder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        (iii) The inspection rights created by the section are limited to "qualified" shareholders as defined in subsection (g), a limitation not found in the Model Act. The concept of "qualified shareholder" is brought forward, with slight modifications, from
                        former G.S. 55-38(a).

                        Common-Law Right of Shareholder to Inspect Records. - At common law stockholders in private corporations have the right to make reasonable inspection of a corporation's books to assure themselves of efficient management. White v. Smith,
                        <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 218</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 628 (1962).

                        Right to Information Is Unqualified. - Former G.S. 55-37 contained no qualifying language. The language was absolute: the corporation "shall" mail or otherwise deliver a copy of its statement of assets and liabilities to "any" shareholder upon his written
                        request therefor. The motive of the requesting shareholder was irrelevant. Morgan v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 467, 253 S.E.2d 339, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 611</cite>,

                        Stockholders Have Right to Inspect Books. - Since the stockholders are, in a sense, the beneficial owners of the corporate assets, and thus the persons primarily interested in seeing that the concern is efficiently and profitably managed, they are entitled
                        to inspect the books and records in order to investigate the conduct of the management, determine the financial condition of the corporation, and generally take an account of the stewardship of the officers and directors, at least
                        where there are circumstances justifying some suspicion of mismanagement. Cooke v. Outland, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 601</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 835 (1965).

                    <p>
                        The mere possibility that a shareholder may abuse his right to gain access to corporate information will not be held to justify denial of a legal right, if such right exists in the shareholder. Carter v. Wilson Constr. Co.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 348 S.E.2d 830 (1986).

                    <p>
                        But Fishing Expedition Is Not Authorized. - Former G.S. 55-38 did not give a stockholder an absolute right of inspection and examination for a mere fishing expedition, or for a purpose not germane to the protection of his economic interest as a shareholder
                        in the corporation. Cooke v. Outland, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 601</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 835 (1965); Carter v. Wilson Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 348 S.E.2d 830 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Proper Purpose. - Where shareholder demanded to inspect corporate records to determine "any possible mismanagement of the Company or any possible misappropriation, misapplication or improper use of any property or asset of the Company," shareholder's
                        stated purpose was proper under subdivision (c)(1) of this section. Parsons v. Jefferson-Pilot Corp., <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 307, 416 S.E.2d 914 (1992), aff'd in part and rev'd in part,

                    <p>
                        "Proper" Motive Required for Actual Visit. - Under former G.S. 55-38(b), the requesting shareholders had to have a "proper purpose" in wanting information. For a shareholder to have the right to actually visit a corporation's office and possibly disrupt
                        its normal operation by inspecting voluminous books and records of account, the legislature correctly decided that his motives must be "proper." Morgan v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite>                        467, 253 S.E.2d 339, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 611</cite>, 257 S.E.2d 436 (1979); Carter v. Wilson Constr.

                        Burden of Proving Improper Purpose. - The burden of proof rests upon the defendants, if they wish to defeat the shareholder's demand, to allege and show by facts, if they can, that the shareholder is motivated by some improper purpose. Carter v. Wilson
                        Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 348 S.E.2d 830 (1986).

                    <p>
                        The right of inspection set forth in section 16.02 includes the general right to copy the documents inspected. Section 16.03 follows precedent established under earlier statutes and extends the right of inspection to an agent or attorney of a shareholder
                        as well as the shareholder himself. Further, the section now recognizes that a right to copy means more than a right to copy by longhand and extends to the right to receive, if reasonable, copies made by the modern technology of
                        copying machines with the cost of reproduction being paid by the shareholder.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many corporations make available to shareholders without charge some or all of the basic documents described in section 16.01(e). Section 16.03(c) authorizes the corporation to charge a reasonable fee based on reproduction costs (including labor and materials)
                        for providing a copy of any document.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.03(d) is designed to give the corporation the option of providing a reasonably current list of its shareholders instead of granting the right of inspection; a "reasonably current" list is defined in section 16.03(d) as one compiled no earlier
                        than the date of the written demand, which under section 16.02(b) must provide at least five days' notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The phrase "estimated cost of production or reproduction of the records" in section 16.03(c) refers to the cost of assembling information and data to meet a demand as well as the cost of reproducing documents that are already in existence.

                    <p>
                        Section 16.04 provides a judicial remedy if a corporation refuses to grant the right of inspection provided by section 16.02.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If the right of inspection under section 16.02(a) is invoked and the corporation refuses to grant inspection, the shareholder may seek a summary order compelling inspection. A summary order is appropriate since the right of inspection under this subsection
                        is either automatic or subject only to a determination that the person is in fact a shareholder of the corporation. By contrast, if inspection is demanded under section 16.02(b), the shareholder's good faith and purpose may be
                        in issue; in this situation section 16.04(b) directs the court to handle the proceeding "on an expedited basis." The purpose of this phrase is to discourage dilatory tactics to avoid or delay inspection without requiring the court
                        to resolve these issues on a summary basis. This language does not mandate any specific procedure by which these issues are to be resolved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a court enters a summary order directing inspection under section 16.02(a), the cost of reproducing the records, if any, is placed on the corporation. Section 16.04 does not address who should bear the cost of reproducing other records ordered by the
                        court; this is a matter for the courts to decide in light of the policy of the Model Act that costs of reproduction are generally the responsibility of the requesting shareholder and should be assessed against him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The principal sanction against unreasonable delay or refusal to grant inspection is provided by section 16.04(c), which imposes on the corporation the plaintiff's costs, including attorneys' fees, unless the corporation can establish that it acted reasonably.
                        The corporation may avoid these costs by showing that the corporation refused inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis for doubt about the right of the shareholder to inspect the records demanded. This normally
                        will involve reasonable doubt whether the shareholder had the necessary good faith and proper purpose or whether the records demanded are directly connected to the shareholder's purpose. The phrase "in good faith because it had
                        a reasonable basis for doubt" establishes a partially objective standard, in that the corporation must be able to point to some objective basis for its doubt that the shareholder was acting in good faith or had a purpose that was
                        proper. For example, a corporation may point to earlier conduct of the shareholder involving improper use of information obtained from the corporation in the past as indicating that reasonable doubt existed as to his present purpose.
                        A corporation may not avoid the imposition of costs under this section merely by showing it had no information one way or the other about the issues in controversy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Earlier versions of the Model Act and the statutes of many states imposed a penalty upon the corporation or its officers for refusal to permit inspection of books and records by shareholders who (1) had been shareholders for at least six months or (2)
                        owned five percent or more of the outstanding shares. This provision has been omitted. A penalty unrelated to the costs of securing inspection was arbitrary and, as a result, was seldom actually enforced; further, a qualification
                        based on the size or duration of the shareholder's holding unrelated to his actual purpose was subject to the criticism that it constituted unreasonable discrimination against small shareholders.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT

                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The requirement that a corporation regularly submit some financial information to shareholders is appropriate considering the relationship between corporate management and the shareholders as the ultimate owners of the enterprise. This requirement was
                        first added as an amendment in 1979 to the 1969 Model Act.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.20 has its principal impact on small, closely held corporations, since enterprises whose securities are registered under federal statutes are required to supply audited financial statements to shareholders. The securities of the vast majority
                        of corporations in the United States are not registered under federal law. It is these corporations that section 16.20 principally affects.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.20 requires every corporation to prepare and submit to shareholders annual financial statements consisting of a balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year, an income statement for the year, and a statement of changes in shareholders' equity
                        for the year. The last statement may be omitted if the data that normally appears in that statement appears in the other financial statements or in the notes thereto. Consolidated statements of the corporation and any subsidiary,
                        or subsidiaries, or combined statements for corporations under common control, may be used. But section 16.20 does not require financial statements to be prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").
                        Many small corporations have never prepared financial statements on the basis of GAAP. "Cash basis" financial statements (often used in preparing the tax returns of small corporations) do not comply with GAAP. Even closely held
                        corporations that keep accrual basis records, and file their federal income tax returns on that basis, frequently do not make the adjustments that may be required to present their financial statements on a GAAP basis. In light
                        of these considerations, it would be too burdensome on some small and closely held corporations to require GAAP statements. If a corporation does prepare financial statements on a GAAP basis for any purpose for the particular year,
                        however, it must send those statements to the shareholders as provided by the last sentence of section 16.20(a).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.20(b) requires an accompanying report or statement in one of two forms: (1) if the financial statements have been reported upon by a public accountant, his report must be furnished; or (2) in other cases, a statement of the president or the
                        person responsible for the corporation's accounting records must be furnished (i) stating his reasonable belief as to whether the financial statements were prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, and,
                        if not, describing the basis on which they were prepared, and (ii) describing any respects in which the financial statements were not prepared on a basis of accounting consistent with those prepared for the previous year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.20 refers to a "public accountant." The same terminology is used in section 8.30 (standards of conduct for directors) of the Model Act. In various states different terms are employed to identify those persons who are permitted under the state
                        licensing requirements to act as professional accountants. Phrases like "independent public accountant," "certified public accountant," "public accountant," and others may be used. In adopting the term "public accountant," the
                        Model Act uses the words in a general sense to refer to any class or classes of persons who, under the applicable requirements of a particular jurisdiction, are professionally entitled to practice accountancy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In requiring a statement by the president or person responsible for the corporation's financial affairs, it is recognized that in many cases this person will not be a professionally trained accountant and that he should not be held to the standard required
                        of a professional. To emphasize this difference, section 16.20 requires a "statement" (rather than a "report" or "certificate") and calls for the person to express his "reasonable belief" (rather than "opinion") about whether or
                        not the statements are prepared on the basis of GAAP or, if not, to describe the basis of presentation and any inconsistencies in the basis of the presentation as compared with the previous year. He is not required to describe
                        any inconsistencies between the basis of presentation and GAAP. If the statements are not prepared on a GAAP basis, the description would normally follow guidelines of the accounting profession as to the reporting format considered
                        appropriate for a presentation which departs from GAAP. (See, e.g., "Statement on Auditing Standards No. 14" of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.) For example, the description might state, with respect to
                        a cash basis statement of receipts and disbursements, that the statement was prepared on that basis and that it presents the cash receipts and disbursements of the entity for the period but does not purport to present the results
                        of operations on the accrual basis of accounting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 16.20(c) specifies that annual financial statements are to be mailed to each shareholder within 120 days after the close of each fiscal year, further emphasizing that the statements required to be delivered are annual statements and not interim
                        statements. In addition, if a shareholder was not mailed the corporation's latest annual financial statements, he may obtain them on written request. See also section 16.01(e)(5).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Failure to comply with the requirements of section 16.20 does not adversely affect the existence or good standing of the corporation. Rather, failure to comply gives an aggrieved shareholder rights to compel compliance or to obtain damages, if they can
                        be established, under general principles of law.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The financial statements required by this section are more extensive than those required by former G.S. 55-37(a)(4). Also, prior law did not require that the financial statements, or written notice of their availability, be mailed annually to shareholders.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act in several respects. Subsection (a) was modified to refer to a "statement of cash flows" instead of a "statement of changes in shareholders' equity," in accordance with the provisions of FASB-95. Subsection (c)
                        was modified to permit the corporation to mail either the annual financial statements "or a written notice of their availability" and to provide that in the absence of bad faith mere failure to comply with this section will not
                        expose the directors to personal liability.

                    <p>
                        The requirement relating to the annual report that each corporation must submit to the secretary of state has been modified in section 16.22 in an effort to make it a limited information document for use by the secretary of state, members of the general
                        public, and shareholders. The purpose of the annual report is to show the location of the principal office of the corporation, the names and business addresses of its directors and principal officers, the general nature of the
                        corporation's business, and its capital structure. It permits members of the general public to ascertain the identity of the corporation and communicate directly with it. It also establishes the alternative to the registered office
                        for service of process and related matters. The "principal office" of the corporation is defined as the location of its executive office in section 1.40.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The reference to "principal officers" in section 16.22(a)(4) is intended to simplify reporting requirements of corporations with very large numbers of employees who have some managerial responsibility and who, for business reasons, are designated as officers.
                        The "principal officers" of a corporation include at least the chairman of the board of directors, the chief executive officer, and the officers performing the traditional functions performed by the corporate secretary and treasurer,
                        no matter what their designation.

                        The annual report is required of both domestic corporations and foreign corporations qualified to transact business in the state. The failure to file the annual report, like the failure to satisfy other mandatory requirements of the Act, is a ground for
                        administrative dissolution or revocation of the certificate of authority to transact business.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section requires an annual report to the Secretary of State. The prior North Carolina law contained no such requirement.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section differs from the Model Act by expressly providing that it will not apply to professional corporations (notwithstanding <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055B.html#t55Bs55B-3" target="_blank">G.S. 55B-3</a></cite>)
                        and by not requiring disclosure of a corporation's authorized shares or its outstanding shares. Subdivision (a)(4) adds a requirement that the titles of officers be included in the annual report, so the Model Act requirement for
                        listing directors' names and business addresses was placed in a separate subdivision (a)(4a). Also, subsection (c) is slightly different from the Model Act in the filing deadlines and in requiring the Secretary of State to distribute
                        forms for the annual report each year. Subsection (e), which is not in the Model Act, allows the filing of amendments to any previously filed annual reports.

        OFFICIAL COMMENT
       </b>
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The fundamental principle underlying section 17.01 is that the revised Model Act should ultimately be made fully applicable to all existing business corporations as well as to all new business corporations formed after the effective date of the new statute.
                        It is undesirable to "grandfather" existing corporations under earlier statutes since that results in the permanent coexistence of two different and overlapping systems of corporation law, with resulting confusion. This is particularly
                        true of the revised Model Act, which builds directly on the experience of many years with existing corporation statutes and contains few major substantive changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 17.01 applies this basic principle in its broadest sense by making the revised Act applicable as of its "effective date" (prescribed in section 17.06) to all domestic corporations formed under general statutes for corporations for profit. This
                        includes all prior general business corporation acts, but not statutes providing for not-for-profit corporations or associations, or corporations formed for the purpose of engaging in a business for which the state has provided
                        a separate incorporation procedure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section 17.01 applies the revised Model Act to all corporations to which that application is constitutionally permissible. In view of the universal adoption of "reservation of power" clauses in all states for more than a century, there are very few active
                        business corporations to which this Act will not be applicable under this section.

                        The provisions of former G.S. 55-3(a) and (b) were brought forward with modifications as subsections (a) and (b) of this section in lieu of the Model Act's provisions. In subsection (a) the words "except to the extent the corporation is expressly excepted
                        by this act from its operation" were substituted for the words "unless the corporation is expressly excepted from the operation hereof" in former G.S. 55-3(a) to provide for partial exceptions and to make it clear that the referenced
                        exceptions are only those in the North Carolina Business Corporation Act itself. In subsection (b) the words "not for profit" were inserted after "corporation" to limit the prohibition only to corporations not formed for profit.
                        The term "not for profit" is broader than "nonprofit" and was used in subsection (a) in order to "grandfather" those not for profit corporations having capital stock that were formed prior to the enactment of the Business Corporation
                        Act in 1955.

                        Section 17.02 makes the revised Model Act applicable on its effective date to all foreign corporations that are qualified to transact business in the state on that date. But these corporations need not refile and obtain new certificates of authority under
                        the Act. While chapter 15 of the revised Model Act may change the rules applicable to foreign corporations in some states, these changes are not of a type that require a transition period. It is therefore recommended that only
                        a single effective date be provided for the application of the Act to foreign corporations and that delayed effective dates for specific provisions in this regard are unnecessary.

                    <p>
                        The Model Act is intended to be a complete substitute for earlier statutes of general applicability to business corporations and it is contemplated that all these statutes should normally be repealed when the revised Model Act is enacted. A few states
                        in the past have retained portions of earlier statutes while enacting integrated codifications of business corporation law. This practice is generally undesirable since it tends to cause unnecessary confusion in determining the
                        applicable law as well as creating possible internal statutory conflicts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many states have enacted statutes providing special incorporation and regulatory provisions for corporations engaged in specific businesses, like banking and insurance. These specialized statutes should not be included in the list of statutes repealed
                        by section 17.05. Many of these specialized statutes expressly "borrow" provisions from the general corporation act to fill in gaps or to provide applicable rules when the specialized statute is silent. As a general matter, it
                        would be desirable to ensure that these statutes are amended to refer specifically to the present Act rather than to an earlier statute; an appropriate provision would apply this Act to all these corporations except to the extent
                        the specialized statute expressly provides that a different principle should be applicable.
