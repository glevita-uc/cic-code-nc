     NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY
    </b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This revision of the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act (hereinafter the "Act") is based in large part upon the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (hereinafter "BCA"). Accordingly, the Act follows the same general organization and numbering
            system as the BCA and, where appropriate, incorporates the substance of the BCA. Stylistic or other minor differences in language and form between certain sections of the Act and the sections of the BCA from which they are derived are not
            intended to imply substantive differences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although the drafters reviewed the Revised Model Nonprofit Corporation Act (1987) (hereinafter the "Model Act") and adopted certain of its provisions, the Act is substantially different from the Model Act. For that reason, the Official Comments to the
            Model Act are not included in this commentary.
        </p>
        <p>
            The North Carolina comments are designed to note significant substantive changes from prior law, to highlight certain provisions of the Act that had no counterpart in the prior law and to explain certain provisions of the Act. For any section of the Act
            that is the same or substantially the same as the corresponding section of the BCA, it is appropriate to refer to the comments to the corresponding BCA section.
        </p>
        <p>
            Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1993, c. 398, s. 1, effective July 1, 1994, rewrote
            <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> and entitled it the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation Act, to replace former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>,
            entitled the Nonprofit Corporation Act, which had been adopted by Session Laws 1955, c. 1230.
        </p>
        <p>
            For tables of corresponding sections of former and new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>, see the tables at the end of this Chapter.
        </p>
        <p>
            Section 2 of Session Laws 1993, c. 398 provides: "The Revisor of Statutes shall cause to be printed along with this act all explanatory comments of the drafters of this act as the Revisor may deem appropriate."
        </p>
        <p>
            The Official Comments appearing under individual sections in this Chapter have been printed by the publisher as received, without editorial change, and relate to the Chapter as originally enacted. However, not all sections in this Chapter may carry Official
            Comments. Furthermore, Official Comments may or may not have been received or updated in conjunction with subsequent amendments to this Chapter and, therefore, may not reflect all changes to the sections under which they appear.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where they appear in this Chapter, "Amended Comment" usually means that an error in the original comment has been corrected by a subsequent amendment, and "Supplemental Comment" pertains to a later development, such as an amendment to the statute text.
            North Carolina Comments explain where the General Assembly has enacted variations to the text of the Uniform Act.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where appropriate, the historical citations to sections of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> have been added to corresponding sections in new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the case notes appearing under the sections of this Chapter were decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> or under prior law.

                <p>
                    This section defines more terms than former G.S. 55A-2. Several definitions deserve special mention:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Charitable or religious corporation" is defined in subdivision (4) to mean a corporation (a) that the Internal Revenue Service has determined is tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, (b) that qualifies for tax exemption under
                    Section 501(c)(3) but with respect to which no determination has been made by the Internal Revenue Service, or (c) that would qualify for tax exemption under Section 501(c)(3) if it did not engage in certain prohibited political activities
                    or other disqualifying activities. Section 501(c)(3) generally provides tax exempt status to corporations organized and operated exclusively for one or more of the following purposes: religious, charitable, scientific, testing for
                    public safety, literacy, educational or prevention of cruelty to children or animals. Certain provisions of the Act apply exclusively to charitable or religious corporations and distributions by charitable or religious corporations
                    are strictly limited by Article 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Distribution" is defined broadly in subdivision (8) to include transfers to, and debt incurred for the benefit of, members, directors, officers and transferees in liquidation. This broad definition effectuates the basic rule that a nonprofit corporation
                    is prohibited from making distributions except as specifically authorized by Article 13.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subdivision (16) makes clear that a person does not have the rights of a member (under Article 16, for example), solely by reason of having voting rights or other rights commonly associated with membership.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - The subdivision added by Session Laws 1999-369, s. 2.2, has been designated as (24a) pursuant to directions from the Revisor of Statutes.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2001-358, s. 53, provided that the act, which amended this section, was effective October 1, 2001, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date. Section 173 of Session Laws 2001-387 changed the effective date of
                    Session Laws 2001-358 from October 1, 2001, to January 1, 2002. Section 6 of Session Laws 2001-413, effective September 14, 2001, added a sentence to s. 175(a) of Session Laws 2001-387, making s. 173 of that act effective when it became
                    law (August 26, 2001). As a result of these changes, the amendment by Session Laws 2001-358 is effective January 1, 2002, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2001-387, s. 154(6) provides that nothing in this act shall supersede the provisions of Article 10 or 65 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html" target="_blank">Chapter 58</a></cite> of the General Statutes,
                    and this act does not create an alternate means for an entity governed by Article 65 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html" target="_blank">Chapter 58</a></cite> of the General Statutes to convert to a different
                    business form.

      </b> - Session Laws 2001-358, s. 5(b), effective January 1, 2002, and applicable to documents submitted for filing on or after that date, rewrote subdivision (10).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2013-157, s. 4, effective January 1, 2014, substituted "the term 'LLC' in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.057D.html#t57Da01s57D-1-03" target="_blank">G.S. 57D-1-03</a></cite>" for "in G.S. 57C-1-03" in subdivision

                    The prior law contained no general definition of "notice." Subdivision (e)(4) recognizes that nonprofit corporations may have special mailing privileges. Notices mailed at the nonprofit rate are effective 30 days after deposit in the United States mail.

                    This section is substantially the same as former G.S. 55A-15(c). It is applicable to nonprofit corporations that are private foundations, as defined in Section 509(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, and is intended to comply with Section 1.508-3(d) of the
                    Income Tax Regulations, which provides that a private foundation's governing instrument is deemed to conform with the requirements of Section 508(e) of the Code if valid provisions of state law require the foundation to comply with
                    the requirements and prohibitions described in Section 508(e)(1) of the Code.

                    This section had no counterpart in the prior law and is adapted from the Model Act. It authorizes the superior court, in its discretion, to prescribe special procedures that will enable a corporation to call and conduct meetings or obtain the consent
                    of members, delegates or directors when it is otherwise impracticable to do so. This section permits judicial relief only if the procedures established in the corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws or prescribed by statute
                    are not viable under the circumstances and any relief granted should be limited in scope to that necessary to remove the impediment which makes compliance with such procedures impracticable, regardless of whether the impediment prevents
                    a continuation of the corporation's activities or consideration of dissolution, merger or a sale of the corporation's assets.

                    A provision limiting or eliminating the personal liability of directors in certain circumstances may now be included in the articles of incorporation. Although such a provision affects only claims by or on behalf of the corporation and does not relieve

                    This section eliminates the distinction that former G.S. 55A-15 made between unconditional powers and those exercisable only "in connection with carrying out the purposes stated in its charter." The authority for nonprofit corporations to make loans to

                    The language "any other person" in the last phrase in subdivision (a)(17) can include a member if the corporation has an insurable interest in the member. Under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.058.html#t58a58s58-58-86" target="_blank">G.S. 58-58-86</a></cite>,
                    a charitable or religious corporation that purchases or receives by assignment life insurance is deemed to have an insurable interest in the insured person's life if the insured person consents to the purchase or assignment.

                        Assessment to Pay Legal Fees. - Homeowners association's "welfare" covenant was not vague with respect to the levy of a special assessment for legal fees incurred in a discrimination dispute with two homeowners as under the North Carolina Nonprofit Corporation
                        Act, specifically <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55Aa03s55A-3-02ol1a1" target="_self">G.S. 55A-3-02(a)(1)</a></cite>, the association had the power to sue and be sued, and it was foreseeable that the association
                        would have to pay fees to defend itself; the covenant contained an ascertainable standard by which it could be objectively determined if the amount of the assessment and the purpose for which it was levied fell within the covenant.

                        Civil Court's Jurisdiction Over Church's Termination of Members. - Members of a church, which was a nonprofit corporation under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 55A</a></cite> of
                        the North Carolina General Statutes, could not turn to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55Aa06s55A-6-31ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 55A-6-31(a)</a></cite> to claim that their membership in the church was improperly terminated in violation
                        of that statute because the courts of the State of North Carolina did not have jurisdiction in what were ecclesiastical disputes. Tubiolo v. Abundant Life Church, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 605 S.E.2d
                        161 (2004), cert. denied, - U.S. - , 126 S. Ct. 350, 163 L. Ed. 2d 59 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Termination of Private Country Club Membership. - Because a private country club, which was organized as a nonprofit corporation, adhered to its own internal rules and provided certain members with prior notice and an opportunity to be heard, there was
                        no justification for judicial intervention on the members' behalf when the club terminated the members' membership in the club. Master v. Country Club of Landfall, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite>                        181, 823 S.E.2d 115 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Declaratory Judgment Claims Moot. - Country club (club) member's declaratory judgment claims seeking (1) a judgment relating to the status of the member's membership, when the club terminated the membership without prior notice, and (2) as to whether
                        the club could conduct a curative post-termination hearing were moot because any judgment that the manner of termination did not meet a statutory "fair and reasonable and good faith" requirement or that post-termination hearings
                        were impermissible under the statute had no practical effect, since the member could not recover damages due to a failure to mitigate. Emerson v. Cape Fear Country Club, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite>                        755, 817 S.E.2d 402 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Damages. - When a member sought damages for a country club's (club) termination of the member's membership without prior notice, the club was entitled to summary judgment because (1) prior notice was not statutorily required, and, (2) even if the termination
                        were a statutory violation, the member could not recover damages since the member did not mitigate damages. Emerson v. Cape Fear Country Club, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 755, 817 S.E.2d 402
                        (2018).

                    Subsection (a) is a departure from prior law and recognizes that the traditional written notice to each member by personal delivery or mail may be burdensome in certain cases. Thus, notice may be given by any means that is consistent with the bylaws and
                    that is "fair and reasonable when all the circumstances are considered." Relevant circumstances include the purpose of the meeting and the nature and size of the corporation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (c) establishes a "safe harbor" for what is fair and reasonable notice, but subsection (b) provides that the safe harbor is not mandatory except with respect to matters referred to in subdivision (c)(2).

                        Derivative Action Not Appropriate. - Even if the board had exceeded its authority, a member's derivative action would not have been the appropriate cause of action where plaintiff alleged no injury to the association by the board's action and was not
                        seeking to recover on behalf of the association. Stewart v. Kopp, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 454 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 263</cite>, 456 S.E.2d 838 (1995).

                        Reasonable Cause to Bring Action Not Shown. - Condo owners did not have a "reasonable belief" that there was a "sound chance" that the derivative action alleging negligence could be sustained, as they had no evidence to show that worked performed by the

                    Although the word "fiduciary" is no longer used in describing the duty owed by a director, there is no intent to change North Carolina law in this area. See North Carolina Commentary to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html#t55a08s55-8-30" target="_blank">G.S. 55-8-30</a></cite>.

                <p>
                    The Model Act counterpart of this section contains a provision in subsection (b) explicitly allowing reliance on ministers, priests and other religious authorities in the case of religious corporations. That provision was rejected as unnecessary because
                    the subject is adequately covered by subdivision (b)(2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsection (f) should not be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties prescribed by the Uniform Management of Institutional Funds Act in view of the Commentary to G.S. 36B-6, which states that the standard of care and prudence established by that section
                    is generally comparable to that of a director of a business corporation rather than that of a private trustee; but in the event of any inconsistency, the provisions of the Uniform Act will control, as provided in G.S. 36B-8.

                    This section makes clear that the appointment of an officer does not itself create contract rights in the officer. The removal of an officer with contract rights is without prejudice to his later enforcement of contract rights in a suit for damages for
                    breach of contract. See the Official Comment to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.055.html#t55a08s55-8-43" target="_blank">G.S. 55-8-43</a></cite>. Similarly, an officer with an employment contract who
                    prematurely resigns may be in breach of his employment contract. The mere appointment of an officer for a term does not create a contractual obligation on his part to complete the term.

                        have acted pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55Aa07s55A-7-02ol1a2" target="_self">G.S. 55A-7-02(a)(2)</a></cite> to call a special meeting of the membership. Subdivision (a)(2) differs from former
                        G.S. 55A-35(a)(1) in that approval by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast is required. Subdivision (a)(3) and subsections (b) and (c) had no counterpart in the prior law.

                    Subdivision (b)(2) differs from former G.S. 55A-43 in that the transaction may generally be approved by a majority of the votes entitled to be cast or by two-thirds of the votes cast, whichever is less. Subdivision (b)(3), by requiring written approval
                    of the transaction by a third party if such approval is required for an amendment of the articles of incorporation or bylaws pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55Aa10s55A-10-30" target="_self">G.S. 55A-10-30</a></cite>,
                    prevents the corporation from circumventing such a third party approval requirement by selling assets. This subdivision had no counterpart in the prior law. Subdivision (b)(3) and subsections (c) and (g) had no counterpart in the prior
                    law. Subsection (g) is based on the Model Act and is designed to provide a measure of protection in sales of all or substantially all of the assets of a charitable or religious corporation.

                        Suit Not Prohibited by the First Amendment. - Incorporators' suit against a church and officers was not prohibited by the First Amendment because the issue of whether the officers' actions were authorized by the bylaws of the church in no way implicated
                        an impermissible analysis by the court based on religious doctrine or practice; the claim required the trial court to apply neutral principles of law to determine whether, inter alia, there was compliance with the North Carolina

                    Under former G.S. 55A-47, a corporation could revoke its dissolution at any time prior to the issuance of a certificate of dissolution by the Secretary of State. Since the provision for issuing a certificate of dissolution has not been brought forward,
                    this section provides that any revocation must occur within 120 days after the effective date of its articles of dissolution.

       NORTH CAROLINA COMMENTARY
      </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Act does not bring forward the duty of the Attorney General under former G.S. 55A-51 to bring an action for involuntary dissolution under certain circumstances.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subdivision (a)(2) differs from prior law in the following respects: First, the requirement in former G.S. 55A-53(a)(1)a. that "irreparable injury to the corporation or to the public" be established when the directors are deadlocked was not brought forward.
                    Second, the prior law did not expressly provide that deadlock of the members was grounds for involuntary dissolution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The requirement in former G.S. 55A-53(b) that a creditor must show that the corporation is insolvent in order to be entitled to judicial dissolution was not brought forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even if there are grounds for dissolution under subsection (a), subsection (b) requires the court to consider other factors. Although former G.S. 55A-53(f), which permitted the court to grant relief other than dissolution, was not brought forward, the
                    court has inherent power to grant such alternative relief under subsection (b). In addition, if dissolution is ordered and the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the dissolved corporation do not provide for the disposition of its
                    assets, it is intended that the assets will be distributed or transferred as directed by the court. See former G.S. 55A-57(b) and (c).

                        Purpose of Section. - This section was designed to give broad legislative approval to the use in evidence of corporate computer records. However, in declaring such computer records admissible in evidence it does not deal with the special problems of reliability
                        created by the use of computers. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).

                        Section authorizes admission of corporate computer records under appropriate safeguards deemed sufficient to render them trustworthy. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).

                    <p>
                        But Does Not Preclude Judicial Development of Standards for Admission. - This section does not, and was not designed to, preclude judicial development of workable standards for the admission of computerized business records generally. State v. Springer,
                        <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).

                    <p>
                        Conditions Under Which Printouts Are Admissible. - Printout cards or sheets of business records stored on electronic computing equipment are admissible in evidence, if otherwise relevant and material, if: (1) The computerized entries were made in the
                        regular course of business, (2) the entries were made at or near the time of the transaction involved, and (3) a proper foundation for such evidence is laid by testimony of a witness who is familiar with the computerized records
                        and the methods under which they were made so as to satisfy the court that the methods, the sources of information, and the time of preparation render such evidence trustworthy. State v. Springer,
                        <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973); State v. Stapleton, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 363, 224 S.E.2d 204, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 554</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 513 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Computer printout evidence may be refuted to the same extent as business records made in books of account. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).

                    <p>
                        Testimony as to contents of computer printout is inadmissible under the best evidence rule. State v. Springer, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Failure to Lay Foundation for Admission. - Computer printout referred to in oral testimony is inadmissible where no foundation is laid for its admission and the printout itself is not offered in evidence. State v. Springer,
                        <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 627</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 530 (1973).

                        Suit Not Prohibited by the First Amendment. - Incorporators' suit against a church and officers was not prohibited by the First Amendment because the issue of whether the officers' actions were authorized by the bylaws of the church in no way implicated
                        an impermissible analysis by the court based on religious doctrine or practice; the claim required the trial court to apply neutral principles of law to determine whether, inter alia, there was compliance with the North Carolina
                        Nonprofit Corporation Act. Johnson v. Antioch United Holy Church, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 714 S.E.2d 806 (2011).

                    In certain respects, the inspection rights provided by this section are more limited than those set forth in former G.S. 55A-27, which provided inspection rights with respect to "all books and records." However, unlike prior law, inspection rights are
                    now granted with respect to the records of subsidiary corporations. For certain records, subsection (c) imposes conditions other than a "proper purpose," which was the only requirement under the prior law.

                    A nonprofit corporation is not required to have financial statements but, if it elects to have them, subsection [subdivision] (e)(5) generally requires them to be kept at the principal office and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t55Aa16s55A-16-02ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 55A-16-02(a)</a></cite>                    makes them available for inspection by members. However, in addition to its general right not to have any financial statements at all, a charitable or religious corporation may provide in its articles of incorporation or bylaws that
                    it will not furnish financial statements to its members. In that case, members will not have inspection rights with respect to the financial statements.
