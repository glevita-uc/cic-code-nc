            Licensed real estate brokers and real estate firms may be exempt from the auction firm examination provided they employ or associate themselves with a licensed auctioneer to handle those aspects of the transactions peculiar to the auctioneer
            profession. Any person or entity, on the effective date of this Chapter, duly licensed as an auction firm in good standing is not required to take any examination in order to maintain or to renew an auction firm license provided that the license
            does not otherwise expire or lapse and is not suspended or revoked by the Commission.

            Applicability of Itinerant Merchant License Requirement. - If an auctioneer travels into a city or county in which he does not maintain a regular place of business and sells or auctions property owned by him, he must obtain an itinerant merchant license
            pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia02s105-53ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 105-53(d)</a></cite>, as well as comply with any ordinances of the particular city or county governing itinerant merchants.

            place of business in the particular city or county.
