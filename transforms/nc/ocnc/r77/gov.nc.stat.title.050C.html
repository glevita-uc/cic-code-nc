        </h4>
        <p>
            Harassment Could Not Support Civil No-Contact Order. - Finding that a blogger had harassed the victims under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-1" target="_self">G.S. 50C-1(6)</a></cite> and (7) by knowingly publishing electronic or computerized
            transmissions directed at the victims that tormented, terrorized, or terrified the victims and served no legitimate purpose could not support a civil no-contact order, even though the correct definition of harassment under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIXa35s14-277.3" target="_blank">G.S. 14-277.3</a></cite>(c)
            [now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIXa35s14-277.3" target="_blank">G.S. 14-277.3</a></cite>A] was used. Ramsey v. Harman, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 146, 661 S.E.2d 924 (2008).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Harassment Supported No-Contact Order. - Neighbors' conduct in beating on the victim's door, following the victim in her car, and implicitly threatening vandalism to her carport after the victim reported the neighbor to the police constituted unlawful
            conduct sufficient for the issuance of a no-contact order under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-1" target="_self">G.S. 50C-1</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-5" target="_self">G.S. 50C-5</a></cite>. Such
            behavior constituted intimidating a witness in a pending criminal case, in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIIa30s14-226ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 14-226(a)</a></cite>. St. John v. Brantley, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. App.</cite>            558, 720 S.E.2d 754 (2011).
        </p>
        <p>
            trial court properly found that defendant has caused plaintiff substantial emotional distress under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-1" target="_self">G.S. 50C-1(6)</a></cite> where over the course of five years, defendant made frequent
            contact with plaintiff in person, screaming derogatory language at her, he involved law enforcement by making false reports to the county sheriff's department, and physically threatened plaintiff by charging a moving vehicle at her. Norrell
            v. Keely, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 441, - S.E.2d - (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil No-Contact Order Improper. - Civil no-contact order was improperly entered for stalking under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-1" target="_self">G.S. 50C-1(6)</a></cite> since there was no evidence that a blogger intended to cause
            and caused the victims to suffer substantial emotional distress as: (1) the trial court found that the messages on a website did not contain language "threatening to inflict bodily harm" or "physical injury"; (2) a claim that a child became
            "embarrassed" when the child had allegedly observed teachers viewing the blogger's website in the school library was implausible; (3) the blogger never had any communication with the victim or the child, and the child's name was not mentioned
            on the website; and (4) the blog was posted in retaliation for messages posted by the victim on a rival website, and an alleged threatening phone call from the victim's mother. Ramsey v. Harman, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 146,
            661 S.E.2d 924 (2008).
        </p>
        <p>
            Trial court exceeded its authority because it had no authority to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit; neither the complaint nor the ex parte no-contact order mentioned
            firearms, so defendant had no notice of the possibility of an order requiring surrender, and since the trial court imposed the provision after the hearing, sua sponte, neither party had an opportunity to address it at the hearing or to object.

        </h4>
        <p>
            Authority of Trial Court. - Trial court exceeded its authority because it had no authority to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit; neither the complaint nor the ex
            parte no-contact order mentioned firearms, so defendant had no notice of the possibility of an order requiring surrender, and since the trial court imposed the provision after the hearing, sua sponte, neither party had an opportunity to address
            it at the hearing or to object. Russell v. Wofford, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 816 S.E.2d 909 (2018).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Fines. - When a contemnor was found in contempt for violating a no-contact order, a fine was an authorized sanction because, reading <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005A.html#t5Aa02s5A-21" target="_blank">G.S. 5A-21</a></cite>,
            50C-10, 5A-25, and 50C-5 together, the statutes supported the inference that fines were authorized. Tyll v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Civil Contempt. - Proceedings to hold a contemnor in contempt for violating a no-contact order were in civil contempt because (1) the proceedings were initiated pursuant to civil contempt statutes, (2) the order finding the contemnor in contempt included
            civil contempt findings and a "purge" clause, and (3) construing the order as a civil contempt order was consistent with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-10" target="_self">G.S. 50C-10</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005A.html#t5Aa02s5A-25" target="_blank">G.S. 5A-25</a></cite>'s
            default civil contempt rule. Tyll v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 758 S.E.2d 411 (2014).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Order Properly Issued. - Neighbors' conduct in beating on the victim's door, following the victim in her car, and implicitly threatening vandalism to her carport after the victim reported the neighbor to the police constituted unlawful conduct sufficient
            for the issuance of a no-contact order under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-1" target="_self">G.S. 50C-1</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t50Cs50C-5" target="_self">G.S. 50C-5</a></cite>. Such behavior constituted
            intimidating a witness in a pending criminal case, in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIIa30s14-226ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 14-226(a)</a></cite>.

                A temporary civil no-contact order shall be effective for not more than 10 days as the court fixes, unless within the time so fixed the temporary civil no-contact order, for good cause shown, is extended for a like period or a longer period if the respondent

                Any order may be extended one or more times, as required, provided that the requirements of G.S. 50C-6 or G.S. 50C-7, as appropriate, are satisfied. The court may renew an order, including an order that previously has been renewed, upon a motion by the
                complainant filed before the expiration of the current order. The court may renew the order for good cause. The commission of an act of unlawful conduct by the respondent after entry of the current order is not required for an order to
                be renewed. If the motion for extension is uncontested and the complainant seeks no modification of the order, the order may be extended if the complainant's motion or affidavit states that there has been no material change in relevant
                circumstances since entry of the order and states the reason for the requested extension. Extensions may be granted only in open court and not under the provisions of G.S. 50C-6(d).

        <p>
            When the motion for a permanent civil no-contact order comes on for hearing, the complainant may proceed with a motion for a permanent civil no-contact order, and, if the complainant fails to do so, the judge shall dissolve the temporary civil no-contact
            order. On two days' notice to the complainant or on such shorter notice to that party as the judge may prescribe, the respondent may appear and move its dissolution or modification. In that event the judge shall proceed to hear and determine
            such motion as expeditiously as the ends of justice require.

            No-Contact Order Appeal Moot. - Appellate court determined that the first neighbor's appeal of the trial court's issuance of the civil no-contact order entered against the first neighbor had to be dismissed, as the order had expired five months before
            the appeal of it had been calendared to be heard before the appellate court, and thus the matter was moot because no effective relief could be granted. Williams v. Vonderau, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 638 S.E.2d

            Contempt Fine. - When a contemnor was found in contempt for violating a no-contact order, a fine was an authorized sanction because, reading <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.005A.html#t5Aa02s5A-21" target="_blank">G.S. 5A-21</a></cite>,

            Authority of Trial Court. - Trial court exceeded its authority because it had no authority to order defendant not to possess or purchase any firearms, to surrender his firearms, or to revoke his concealed carry permit; neither the complaint nor the ex
            parte no-contact order mentioned firearms, so defendant had no notice of the possibility of an order requiring surrender, and since the trial court imposed the provision after the hearing, sua sponte, neither party had an opportunity to address
            it at the hearing or to object. Russell v. Wofford, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 816 S.E.2d 909 (2018).
