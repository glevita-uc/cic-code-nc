                    Commissioner of Labor, who shall be elected for a term of four years, by the qualified electors of the State, at the same time and places, and in the same manner, as members of the General Assembly are elected. Their term of office
                    shall commence on the first day of January next after their election and continue until their successors are elected and qualified. The persons having the highest number of votes, respectively, shall be declared duly elected, but if
                    two or more be equal and highest in votes for the same office, then one of them shall be chosen by joint ballot of both houses of the General Assembly. Contested elections shall be determined by a joint ballot of both houses of the
                    General Assembly in such manner as shall be prescribed by law.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - An amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981, c. 504, s. 7, was made effective upon certification of approval of the constitutional amendments proposed by ss. 1 through 3 of the 1981 act. The constitutional amendments
                    were submitted to the people at an election held June 29, 1982, and were defeated. Therefore, the 1981 amendment to this section never went into effect.

                        The Governor has the duty to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The constitutional independence of the executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders.
                        In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor, could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively
                        derogative of the Governor's constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers.

                        Right to Grant Conditional Pardon. - The Governor may grant a pardon upon a condition precedent that the prisoner pay the costs of trial, and upon condition subsequent, that he remain of good character and be sober and industrious. Ex parte Williams,

                        Conditions Must Not Be Illegal, Immoral or Impossible. - Power of the Governor to grant a conditional pardon is generally subject to the limitation that the conditions imposed must not be illegal, immoral or impossible of performance, which limitation
                        does not apply to cases wherein the prisoner is only required not to violate the statute law and to remain of good conduct. State v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922).

                        Conditional Pardon Irrevocable Unless Conditions Are Violated. - A pardon with conditions precedent and subsequent is irrevocable after delivery and acceptance, upon compliance by the prisoner with the condition precedent, unless he violates the conditions
                        subsequent by his conduct after release. Ex parte Williams, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 436</cite>, 63 S.E. 108 (1908).

                        Pardon Voided by Breach of Conditions. - Where prisoner has accepted his freedom upon the terms of a conditional pardon from the Governor, his breach of such conditions voids the pardon and cancels his right to further immunity from punishment. State
                        v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922).

                        Rearrest for Violation of Conditions. - Under the provisions of the State Constitution and statutes, a "parole" granted by the Governor to a prisoner imports a conditional pardon, and the Governor may cause his rearrest either upon his own admissions,
                        or on such evidence as he may require, for violating the conditions which the prisoner has accepted under the terms of the parole. State v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337

                    <p>
                        The essential part of a sentence for a violation of the criminal law is punishment for the offense committed, and not the time the sentence shall begin and end; and where a prisoner has accepted a conditional pardon from the Governor and has obtained
                        his freedom, the breaking of the condition after the term would have otherwise expired affords no legal excuse why he should not be recommitted to serve out the balance of his sentence. State v. Yates,

                            class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922).

                        A pardoned prior conviction may not be considered as an aggravating factor during sentencing absent revocation of the pardon by the governor. State v. Clifton, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 481 S.E.2d 393, cert.
                        granted, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 182</cite>, 486 S.E.2d 200, discretionary review improvidently allowed, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 391</cite>, 493 S.E.2d 56 (1997).

                    <p>
                        The reasoning that an increased punishment for a current offense due to a prior pardoned conviction is not punishment for the prior pardoned offense is a legal fiction that conflicts with logic and the administrative duties of the governor; thus, trial
                        court infringed upon the prerogatives of the governor by finding that defendant's prior conviction constituted an aggravating factor. State v. Clifton, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. App.</cite> 471, 481

                <p>
                    The Secretary of State shall, at the State's expense, as soon as possible after publication, provide such number of copies of the Session Laws and Senate and House Journals to federal, State, and local governmental officials, departments and agencies,
                    and to educational institutions of instruction and exchange use, as is determined by the Legislative Services Commission in consultation with the Principal Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate. These publications shall
                    be made available in hardbound and electronic format. Each agency or institution entitled to more than one copy shall receive only one of the copies in hardbound format with the remainder in electronic format, unless that agency or
                    institution requests additional hardbound copies from the Secretary of State by August 1 of the calendar year. The Legislative Services Commission, in consultation with the Principal Clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate,
                    shall determine each year the total number of bound volumes of each publication to be printed and the total number of the electronic copies of each publication to be produced.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any State agency, department, institution, commission, committee, board, division, bureau, officer, or official that does not receive a copy of the Session Laws may, upon written request from their respective department head to the Secretary of State,
                    and upon the discretion of the Secretary of State as to need, be issued copies of the Session Laws on a permanent loan basis with the understanding that should said copies be needed they will be recalled.

                <p>
                    The General Assembly is ultimately responsible for authorizing the expenditure of public moneys, designating the sources from which moneys may be collected, and shaping the administrative structure to perform the work of government throughout the State,
                    and is held finally accountable for how the funds are spent and what is accomplished with them. The legislature should, therefore, provide the basic direction for audits of State agencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the interest of reducing audit overlap and expense at all levels of government, the General Assembly and the Auditor should promote, to the extent possible, coordinated nonduplicating audits of public programs and activities of all governmental levels
                    throughout the State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is the intent of this Article that all State agencies, and entities supported, partially or entirely, by public funds be subject to audit under the policy guidance of the Auditor. Such audits shall be made to assist in furnishing the General Assembly,
                    the Governor, the executive departments and agencies of the State, the governing bodies and executive departments of the political subdivisions of the State, and the public in general with an independent evaluation of public program
                    performance.

                    prescribed by the accounting profession. Upon the recommendation of the Joint Legislative Commission on Governmental Operations may contract with an independent public accountant, qualified management consultant, or other professional
                    person to conduct a financial and compliance, economy and efficiency, and program result audit of the State Auditor.

                        The Treasurer is not required to pay every warrant which the Auditor may sign, but only those which are legally drawn, and the fact that the Auditor finds that a claim for which he issues a warrant on the Treasurer is authorized by law is not binding
                        upon or a protection to the latter. Commercial &amp; Farmers' Bank v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 146</cite>, 23 S.E. 160 (1895).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Treasurer Has No Right to Pay Out Money Except on Proper Warrants. - As it is the duty of the State Treasurer to keep his accounts, showing the transactions of each fiscal year ending December 31, he has no right to pay out money except upon proper warrants
                        drawn upon the proper funds in the treasury. Arendell v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 111</cite>, 34 S.E. 232 (1899).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Treasurer is not liable to a mandamus for refusing to pay a warrant improperly drawn. Arendell v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 111</cite>, 34 S.E. 232 (1899).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Use of mandamus to compel action by State Treasurer. - Where the State Treasurer denies the correctness of a claim audited by the State Auditor and alleges fraud in the creation of the indebtedness or that the services for which a warrant was issued were
                        not rendered, mandamus will not lie to compel him to pay it, the question raised by such claim being for the legislature, and not the courts, to determine. Garner v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 250</cite>,
                        29 S.E. 364 (1898).

                    <p>
                        Refusing to Pay a Claim Where No Warrant Has Been Issued. - Mandamus will not lie to compel the Treasurer to pay a claim where the Auditor has not issued a warrant therefor, as the Treasurer can only pay on such warrant. Burton v. Furnam,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">115 N.C. 166</cite>, 20 S.E. 443 (1894).

                    <p>
                        Treasurer is entitled to a mandamus to enforce the drawing of proper warrants upon the proper funds before paying them, as they are his vouchers. Arendell v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 111</cite>, 34 S.E. 232 (1899).

                    <p>
                        The courts cannot direct the State Treasurer to pay a claim against the State, however just and unquestioned, when there is no legislative appropriation to pay the same; and when there is such an appropriation, the coercive power is applied not to compel
                        payment of the State liability, but to compel a public servant to discharge his duty by obedience to a legislative enactment. Garner v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 250</cite>, 29 S.E. 364 (1898).

                        Refund of Taxes. - The State Treasurer is responsible for the efficient and faithful exercise of the responsibilities of his office, including refunding taxes erroneously collected. Bailey v. State, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 227</cite>,

                <p>
                    Banks and savings and loan associations having State deposits shall furnish to the Auditor of the State, upon the Auditor's request, a statement of the moneys which have been received and paid by them on account of the treasury. The Treasurer shall keep
                    in the Treasurer's office a full account of all moneys deposited in and drawn from all banks and savings and loan associations in which the Treasurer may deposit or cause to be deposited any of the public funds, and these accounts
                    shall be open to the inspection of the Auditor. The Treasurer shall sign all checks, and no depository bank or savings and loan association shall be authorized to pay checks not bearing the Treasurer's official signature. The Treasurer
                    is authorized to use a facsimile signature machine or device in affixing the Treasurer's signature to warrants, checks or any other instrument the Treasurer is required by law to sign. The Commissioner of Banks, the bank examiners,
                    and the savings and loan examiners, when so required by the State Treasurer, shall keep the State Treasurer fully informed at all times as to the condition of all these depository banks and savings and loan associations, so as to fully
                    protect the State from loss. The State Treasurer shall, before making deposits in any bank or savings and loan association, require ample security from the bank or savings and loan association for these deposits.

                    A State agency to which an account receivable is owed is responsible for collecting the account receivable. In fulfilling this responsibility, a State agency shall establish internal policies and procedures for the management and collection of accounts
                    receivable and shall submit its internal policies and procedures to the State Controller for review.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The State Controller shall examine the policies and procedures submitted by a State agency to determine whether they are consistent with statewide policies and procedures adopted by the State Controller. The statewide policies and procedures shall ensure
                    that a State agency takes all cost-effective and appropriate actions to collect accounts receivable owed to it. If the State Controller determines that a State agency's policies and procedures are not consistent with the statewide
                    policies and procedures, the State Controller shall discuss the inconsistencies with the State agency to determine whether special circumstances, such as a requirement of federal law, justify the inconsistencies. If the State Controller,
                    after consulting with the Office of the Attorney General, finds that no special circumstances justify the inconsistencies, the State Controller shall notify the State agency and the State agency shall conform its policies and procedures
                    to the statewide policies and procedures. If the State Controller finds that special circumstances justify the inconsistencies, the State agency's internal policies and procedures shall reflect the special circumstances.

                        On July 23, 2004, the United States Congress declared that "the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide."

                    <li id="t147a6Ds147-86.41ol12">
                        On September 9, 2004, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee that "genocide has occurred and may still be occurring in Darfur" and "the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed bear responsibility."

                    <li id="t147a6Ds147-86.41ol13">
                        On September 21, 2004, addressing the United Nations General Assembly, President George W. Bush affirmed the Secretary of State's finding and stated, "At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of
                        Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are genocide."

                        On December 7, 2004, the U.S. Congress noted that the genocidal policy in Darfur has led to reports of "systematic rape of thousands of women and girls, the abduction of women and children, and the destruction of hundreds of ethnically African villages,
                        including the poisoning of their wells and the plunder of their crops and cattle upon which the people of such villages sustain themselves."

                    <li id="t147a6Ds147-86.41ol15">
                        Also on December 7, 2004, Congress found that "the Government of Sudan has restricted access by humanitarian and human rights workers to the Darfur area through intimidation by military and security forces, and through bureaucratic and administrative
                        obstruction, in an attempt to inflict the most devastating harm on those individuals displaced from their villages and homes without any means of sustenance or shelter."

                        On September 25, 2006, Congress reaffirmed that "the genocide unfolding in the Darfur region of Sudan is characterized by acts of terrorism and atrocities directed against civilians, including mass murder, rape, and sexual violence committed by the Janjaweed
                        and associated militias with the complicity and support of the National Congress Party-led faction of the Government of Sudan."

                        On September 26, 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives stated that "an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 people have been killed by the Government of Sudan and its Janjaweed allies since the [Darfur] crisis began in 2003, more than 2,000,000 people have
                        been displaced from their homes, and more than 250,000 people from Darfur remain in refugee camps in Chad."

                        The Darfur crisis represents the first time the United States Government has labeled ongoing atrocities genocide.

                        The Federal Government has imposed sanctions against the Government of Sudan since 1997. These sanctions are monitored through the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).

                        According to a former chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, "the fact that a foreign company is doing material business with a country, government, or entity on OFAC's sanctions list is, in the SEC staff's view, substantially likely to
                        be significant to a reasonable investor's decision about whether to invest in that company."

                        Since 1993, the U.S. Secretary of State has determined that Sudan is a country the government of which has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, thereby restricting United States assistance, defense exports and sales, and financial
                        and other transactions with the Government of Sudan.

                        A 2006 U.S. House of Representatives report states that "a company's association with sponsors of terrorism and human rights abuses, no matter how large or small, can have a materially adverse result on a public company's operations, financial condition,
                        earnings, and stock prices, all of which can negatively affect the value of an investment."

                        In response to the financial risk posed by investments in companies doing business with a terrorist-sponsoring state, the Securities and Exchange Commission established its Office of Global Security Risk to provide for enhanced disclosure of material
                        information regarding such companies.

                        It is the judgment of this General Assembly that mandatory divestment of public funds from certain companies is a measure that should be employed sparingly and judiciously. A Congressional and Presidential declaration of genocide satisfies this high threshold.

                    "Whereas, boycotts and related tactics have become a tool of economic warfare that threaten the sovereignty and security of key allies and trade partners of the United States; and
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whereas, the State of Israel is the most prominent target of such boycott activity, which began with, but has not been limited to, the Arab League Boycott adopted in 1945, even before Israel's declaration of independence as the reestablished national
                    state of the Jewish people; and
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Whereas, Israel in particular is known for its dynamic and innovative approach in many business sectors, and, therefore, a company's decision to discriminate against Israel, Israeli entities, or entities that do business with or in Israel is an unsound
                    business practice making such a company an unduly risky contracting partner or vehicle for investment; Now, therefore,"
