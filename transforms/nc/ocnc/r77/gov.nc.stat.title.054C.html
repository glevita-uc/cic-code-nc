       § 54C-31. Conversion from State to federal charter.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A State savings bank, stock or mutual, organized and operated under this Chapter, may convert to a federal charter in accordance with the laws and regulations of the United States and with the same force and effect as though originally incorporated under these laws.
   The procedure to effect this conversion is as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-31ol11">
       The savings bank shall submit a plan of conversion to the Commissioner of Banks, who may approve the plan, with or without amendment, or refuse to approve the plan.  If the Commissioner of Banks approves the plan, then the plan shall be submitted to the members or stockholders as provided in the subdivision (2) of this section.  If the Commissioner of Banks refuses to approve the plan, the objections shall be stated in writing and the converting savings bank shall be given an opportunity to amend the plan to obviate the objections or to appeal the Commissioner of Banks' decision to the Commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-31ol12">
       A meeting of the members or stockholders shall be held upon not less than 15 days' notice to each member or stockholder. Notice of the meeting may be mailed to each member or stockholder, postage prepaid, to the last known address, or the board of directors may cause notice of the meeting to be published, once a week for two weeks preceding the meeting, in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the savings bank has its principal office. It is regarded as sufficient notice of the purpose of the meeting if the notice contains substantially the following statement:  "The purpose of this meeting is to consider the conversion of this State chartered savings bank to a federal charter, under the laws of the United States." An appropriate officer of the savings bank shall make proof by affidavit at the meeting of due service of the notice or call for the meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-31ol13">
       At the meeting of the members or stockholders of the savings bank, the members or stockholders may, by affirmative vote of a majority of votes or shares present, in person or by proxy, resolve to convert the savings bank to a federal charter.  A copy of the minutes of the meeting of the members or stockholders certified by an appropriate officer of the savings bank shall be filed in the office of the Commissioner of Banks.  The certified copy when so filed is prima facie evidence of the holding and the action of the meeting.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-31ol14">
       Within a reasonable time after the receipt of a certified copy of the minutes, the Commissioner of Banks shall either approve or disapprove the proceedings of the meeting for compliance with the procedure set forth in this section.  If the Commissioner of Banks approves the proceedings, the Commissioner of Banks shall issue a certificate of approval of the conversion.  The savings bank shall record the certificate in the office of the Secretary of State.  If the Commissioner of Banks disapproves the proceedings, the Commissioner of Banks shall provide a written explanation of the disapproval and notify the savings bank of the disapproval. The savings bank may appeal a disapproval to the Commission.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-31ol15">
       The savings bank shall file an application, in the manner prescribed or authorized by the laws and regulations of the United States, to consummate the conversion to a federal charter.  A copy of the charter or authorization issued to the savings bank by the appropriate federal regulatory authority shall be filed with the Commissioner of Banks.  Upon filing with the Commissioner of Banks, the savings bank shall cease to be a State savings bank and shall be a federal depository institution.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-31ol16">
       Whenever any savings bank converts to a federal charter it shall cease to be a savings bank under the laws of this State, except that its corporate existence is deemed to be extended for the purpose of prosecuting or defending suits by or against it and of enabling it to close its business affairs as a State savings bank and to dispose of and convey its property.  At the time when the conversion becomes effective all the property of the State savings bank including all its rights, title, and interest in and to all property of whatever kind, whether real, personal or mixed, and things in action, and every right, privilege, interest, and asset of any conceivable value or benefit then existing, belonging or pertaining to it, or which would inure to it, shall immediately by act of law and without any conveyance or transfer, and without any further act or deed, be vested in and become the property of the federal depository institution, which shall have, hold and enjoy the same in its own right as fully and to the same extent as the same was possessed, held, and enjoyed by the savings bank; and the federal depository institution as of the effective time of the conversion shall succeed to all the rights, obligations, and relations of the State savings bank.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Any two or more mutual savings banks or any two or more stock savings banks organized and operating, may merge or consolidate into a single savings bank. The procedure to effect the merger is as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-35ol11">
       The directors, or a majority of them, of the savings banks that desire to merge may, at separate meetings, enter into a written agreement of merger signed by them and under the corporate seals of the respective savings banks specifying each savings bank to be merged and the savings bank that is to receive into itself the merging savings bank or banks, and prescribing the terms and conditions of the merger and the mode of carrying it into effect. The merger agreement may provide other provisions with respect to the merger as appear necessary or desirable, or as the Commissioner of Banks may require.
      </li>
      <li id="t54Ca03s54C-35ol12">
       The merger agreement together with copies of the minutes of the meetings of the respective boards of directors verified by the secretaries of the respective savings banks shall be submitted to the Commissioner of Banks, who shall cause a careful investigation and examination to be made of the affairs of the savings banks proposing to merge, including a determination of their respective assets and liabilities. Each savings bank that is investigated and examined shall pay the cost and expense for the examination. If, as a result of the investigation, the Commissioner of Banks concludes that the members or stockholders of each of the savings banks proposing to merge will be benefited by the merger, the Commissioner of Banks shall, in writing, approve the merger. If the Commissioner of Banks deems that the proposed merger will not be in the interest of all members or stockholders of the savings banks so merging, the Commissioner of Banks shall, in writing, disapprove the merger. If the Commissioner of Banks approves the merger agreement, then it shall be submitted, within 45 days after notice to the savings banks of the approval, to the members or stockholders of each savings bank, as provided in subdivision (3) of this section. The savings bank may appeal the disapproval of the merger to the Commission.
