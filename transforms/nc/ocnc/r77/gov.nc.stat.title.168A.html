     Editor's Note.
    </b>
    - Session Laws 2008-83, s. 2, provides: "The UNC-CH Division TEACCH Autism Program (TEACCH), in consultation with the School of Government and the Autism Society of NC, shall develop a video to raise awareness of autism for those involved in government and public service, including information on recognizing the signs and symptoms of autism spectrum disorders, and contacts for further information on appropriate responses to individuals with autism."
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 2009-264, s. 1, provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly to refer to a person with a disability as a person first when directing the drafting of statutes and resolutions. The Legislative Services Office shall incorporate into its drafting training of legislative drafters the preference to avoid language that implies a person as a whole is disabled, equates a person with his or her condition, or is regarded as derogatory or demeaning. The Arc of North Carolina shall provide a list of nationally recognized descriptors to the Legislative Services Office to be used in this training."
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 2009-264, s. 2, provides: "The General Statutes Commission shall recommend to the 2010 reconvened session of the 2009 General Assembly and to the 2011 Regular Session of the General Assembly any statutory changes and drafting policies needed to make the General Statutes and administrative rules refer to a person with a disability as a person first. The goal of such revisions shall be to avoid language that implies a person as a whole is disabled, equates a person with his or her condition, or is regarded as derogatory or demeaning. In making recommendations, the General Statutes Commission shall distinguish those instances where a word or phrase is required by federal law or regulation, is describing a medical diagnosis, or is referring to nonliving entities such as facilities, organizations, programs, services, or zone designations."
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 2009-451, s. 10.21D(a)-(i), as amended by Session Laws 2010-31, s. 10.9, provides: "(a) There is established the Joint Study Committee on Autism Spectrum Disorder and Public Safety (Committee). The Committee shall consist of members and co-chairs appointed by the President Pro Tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The Committee and the terms of the members shall expire when the Committee submits a final report to the General Assembly. Members serve at the pleasure of the appointing officer.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(b) The Committee shall study ways to increase the availability of appropriate autism-specific education and training to public safety personnel, first responder units, judges, district attorneys, magistrates, and related organizations. The Committee may also study any other issue it deems relevant to Autism Spectrum Disorder and public safety.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(c) The Committee shall meet upon the call of its co-chairs. A quorum of the Committee is a majority of its members. No action may be taken except by a majority vote at a meeting at which a quorum is present.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(d) The Committee, while in the discharge of its official duties, may exercise all powers provided for under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120.html#t120a05s120-19" target="_blank">G.S. 120-19</a></cite> and Article 5A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120.html" target="_blank">Chapter 120</a></cite> of the General Statutes.

   </p>
   <p>
    "(e) Members of the Committee shall receive per diem, subsistence, and travel allowance as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.120.html#t120a36s120-311" target="_blank">G.S. 120-3.1</a></cite>, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138.html#t138s138-5" target="_blank">G.S. 138-5</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.138.html#t138s138-6" target="_blank">G.S. 138-6</a></cite>, as appropriate.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(f) The expenses of the Committee shall be considered expenses incurred for the joint operation of the General Assembly. Funds for the Committee shall be as appropriated to the General Assembly for this purpose.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(g) The Legislative Services Officer shall assign professional and clerical staff to assist the Committee in its work. The Director of Legislative Assistants of the House of Representatives and the Director of Legislative Assistants of the Senate shall assign clerical support staff to the Committee.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(h) The Committee may meet at various locations around the State in order to promote greater public participation in its deliberations.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(i) The Committee may submit an interim report on the results of its study, including any proposed legislation, to the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives on or before May 1, 2010, by filing a copy of the report with the Office of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Legislative Library. The Committee shall submit a final report on the results of its study, including any proposed legislation, to the members of the Senate and the House of Representatives upon the completion of its work by filing a copy of the report with the Office of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate, the Office of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Legislative Library. The Committee shall terminate upon the completion of its work."

    Legislative Intent.
   
   - Both the plain language of its provisions and the legislative history surrounding this act indicate that the legislature did not intend to protect persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) under this particular act. Burgess v. Your House of Raleigh, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 205</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 134 (1990).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Act Does Not Protect Asymptomatic Persons Infected with HIV.
   
   - A person who is infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), but who is otherwise asymptomatic, is not entitled to protection under the provisions of this act. Burgess v. Your House of Raleigh, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 205</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 134 (1990).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Plaintiff's claim was not filed within a reasonable time
   
   after the former Handicapped Persons Act right to employment statute was repealed and the new Act was enacted; since "reasonable time" cannot exceed the limitations period allowed under the new law, plaintiff had 180 days after the new Act became effective in which to sue, and plaintiff failed to file within that time period. Spaulding v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 770, 379 S.E.2d 49 (1989), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 44</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 168 (1990).

     School Suspension of ADHD Student Justified.

    - Plaintiffs, student's parents, offered no evidence to show a violation of any North Carolina statute or the North Carolina Constitution where student diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder admitted that he had a gun clip with live bullets in school and he was subjected to external school suspension, his parents attended and participated in disciplinary proceedings, and he was assigned to management school which could accommodate his specialized needs.

    Failure to Rehire Actionable
   
   - An employee had an actionable claim under the NCPDPA for employment discrimination based on an employer's failure to rehire solely for unlawful motives. On remand, there was to be a hearing to determine damages, costs and attorney's fees. Johnson v. Bd. of Trs. of Durham Tech. Cmty. College, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C.

     The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure equality of opportunity, to promote independent living, self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency, and to encourage and enable all persons with disabilities to participate fully to the maximum extent of their abilities in the social and economic life of the State, to engage in remunerative employment, to use available public accommodations and public services, and to otherwise pursue their rights and privileges as inhabitants of this State.
    </li>
    <li id="t168As168A-2ol1b">
     The General Assembly finds that: the practice of discrimination based upon a disabling condition is contrary to the public interest and to the principles of freedom and equality of opportunity; the practice of discrimination on the basis of a disabling condition threatens the rights and proper privileges of the inhabitants of this State; and such discrimination results in a failure to realize the productive capacity of individuals to their fullest extent.

   19 of the North Carolina Constitution, as this section provides an adequate state remedy for the plaintiff's allegation that a judge discriminated against him by refusing to allow his companion dog to accompany him into the judge's courtroom, and having failed to timely use this remedy, he could not call on the court to fashion one under the state constitution.

    <b>
     Action Under Federal Rehabilitation Act.
    </b>
    - When a state has enacted a counterpart to the federal Rehabilitation Act, the statute of limitations of the state counterpart and not the personal injury statute is most analogous and therefore, the most appropriate limitations period. Because this Act is the most analogous statute to the Rehabilitation Act, an action under the federal act must be brought within this section's 180-day period. McCullough v. Branch Banking & Trust Co., 35 F.3d 127 (4th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1151, 115 S. Ct. 1101, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (1995).

    Suit Under Americans with Disabilities Act.
   
   - A visually impaired man's discrimination suit was barred by the 180-day limitations period of this section, where he alleged that a judge barred his companion dog from the courtroom in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.168.html#t168a01s168-4.2" target="_blank">G.S. 168-4.2</a></cite> and federal law. Stroud v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 480, 508 S.E.2d 527 (1998).
   </p>
   <p>
    Where a former graduate student sued a state university and several of its officers (defendants) alleging that she was dismissed from the program due to her disability in violation of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C.S.
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    701 et seq., and common law, dismissal based on the statute of limitations was not warranted because defendants did not show that the student's allegations of disability would have been sufficient to state a claim before enactment of the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, 122 Stat. 3553, and thus application of a two-year limitations period under North Carolina law, rather than a four-year limitation period under 28 U.S.C.S.
    <span class="s1">
     §

    1658, was not warranted. Dickinson v. Univ. of N.C. 91 F. Supp. 3d 755 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 16, 2015).

     Claim Barred.
    </b>
    - Where former employee was officially aware of his termination on January 7, 1993, when he received COBRA eligibility form, but did not file suit until January 31, 1994, his claim was time-barred; he should have filed action within 180 days of January 7, 1993, in order to seek relief. Gower v. Wrenn Handling, Inc., 892 F. Supp. 724 (M.D.N.C. 1995).
   </p>
   <p>
    Because the employee did not file his claim under the NCPDPA until 273 days after the last alleged discriminatory act, the employee's claim was time-barred by the 180 day statute of limitations set forth in
