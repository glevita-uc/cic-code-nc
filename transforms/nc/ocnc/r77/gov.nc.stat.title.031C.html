   <p>
    Upon death of a married person, one half of the property to which this Chapter applies is the property of the surviving spouse and is not subject to testamentary disposition by the decedent or distribution under the laws of succession of this State. One half of that property is the property of the decedent and is subject to testamentary disposition or distribution under the laws of succession of this State. With respect to property to which this Chapter applies, the one half of the property of the decedent is not subject to the surviving spouse's right to petition for an elective share under the provisions of Article 1A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.030.html" target="_blank">Chapter 30</a></cite>, and is not subject to the right to elect a life estate under the provisions of Article 8 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html" target="_blank">Chapter 29</a></cite>.

   <p>
    If the title to any property to which this Chapter applies was held by the decedent at the time of death, or by a trustee of a revocable inter vivos trust created by the decedent, title of the surviving spouse may be perfected by an order of the clerk of superior court who appointed the decedent's personal representative or by execution of an instrument by the personal representative or the heirs or devisees of the decedent with the approval of the said clerk. Neither the personal representative nor the court in which the decedent's estate is being administered has a duty to discover or attempt to discover whether property held by the decedent is property to which this Chapter applies, unless a written demand is made by the surviving spouse or the spouse's successor in interest.
