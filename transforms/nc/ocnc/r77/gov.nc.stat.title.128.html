                            Offices whose duties are congruous may be consolidated; but it is just, in cases of consolidation of offices, to postpone the operation of the law until a vacancy appears in the office whose duties are to be transferred. Troy v. Wooten,
                            <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. 377</cite> (1849).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Legislature May Change Duties and Emoluments. - The legislature may reduce or increase the salaries of such officers as are not protected by the Constitution during their term of office, but cannot deprive them of the whole. Cotten v. Ellis,
                            <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. 545</cite> (1860).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The legislature may attach additional duties to an existing office, and it may afterwards lop off those duties and assign them to a new office, leaving the original office as it was before the additional duties were attached to it. State ex rel. Dowtin
                            v. Beardsley, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 119</cite>, 35 S.E. 241 (1900).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In respect to offices created and provided for by the Constitution, the people in convention assembled alone can alter, change their tenure, duties or emoluments, or abolish them; while in respect to legislative offices, it is entirely within the power
                            of the legislature to deal with them as public policy may suggest and public interest may demand. Mial v. Ellington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 131</cite>, 46 S.E. 961 (1903).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Unless the Constitution otherwise expressly provides, the legislature has power to increase or vary the duties, or diminish the salary or other compensation appurtenant to the office, or abolish any of its rights or privileges before the end of the term,
                            or to alter or abridge the term, or to abolish the office itself. State ex rel. Caldwell v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 425</cite>, 28 S.E. 554 (1897), appeal dismissed, 169 U.S. 586,
                            18 S. Ct. 435, 42 L. Ed. 865 (1898); Mial v. Ellington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 131</cite>, 46 S.E. 961 (1903).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although an office is a constitutional one, the legislature may, within reasonable limits, change the statutory duties and diminish the emoluments of such office, if the public welfare requires it. Fortune v. Buncombe County Comm'rs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 322</cite>, 52 S.E. 950 (1905); Commissioners v. Stedman, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 448</cite>, 54 S.E. 269 (1906).

                        <p>
                            Necessity of Taking Oath. - The taking of an oath of office is not an indispensable criterion, for the office may exist without it. State ex rel. Clark v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 59</cite> (1872); State ex rel.
                            Bryan v. Patrick, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 651</cite>, 33 S.E. 151 (1899).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Manner of Appointment. - Where officers have to be appointed to fill a regular term, the Governor nominates to the Senate, unless it be an officer who is elected by the people, and then he fills the vacancy or term until the people can elect his successor.

                            The power to create vacancies in a public office, the incumbents of which are charged with continuing duties and responsibilities, rests, in the absence of provisions to the contrary, in the body possessing the original power of appointment. State ex

                            In General. - Public office is tenure by virtue of an appointment, conferred by public authority. Willis v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 62</cite> (1860).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The term embraces the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument and duties. State ex rel. Bryan v. Patrick, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 651</cite>, 33 S.E. 151 (1899).

                        <p>
                            A public office is an agency for the State, and the person whose duty it is to perform this agency is a public officer. State ex rel. Clark v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 59</cite>, 8 Am. R. 488 (1872); State ex
                            rel. Barnhill v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 493</cite>, 29 S.E. 720 (1898); State Prison v. Day, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 362</cite>, 32 S.E. 748 (1899).

                        <p>
                            Definition of Public Officer - This is considered to be the true definition of a public officer in its original, broad sense. The essence of it is the duty of performing an agency, that is, of doing some act or acts or series of acts for the State. State
                            ex rel. Clark v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 59</cite> (1872).

                        <p>
                            True Test of Public Office is Parcel of the Administration of Government. - The true test of a public office is that it is a parcel of the administration of government, or is itself directly created by the lawmaking power. Eliason v. Coleman,
                            <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 235</cite> (1882).

                        <p>
                            Portion of Sovereignty Attaches. - An office or place of trust requiring a proceeding by quo warranto for the removal of the incumbent is defined as a public position to which a portion of the sovereignty of the country, either legislative, executive
                            or judicial, attaches for the time being, and which is exercised for the benefit of the public. State ex rel. Wooten v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 476</cite>, 59 S.E. 649 (1907).

                        <p>
                            Combination of Duty and Agency. - The word "office" in its primary signification implies a duty or duties - the agency from the State to perform the duties. The duties of the office are of first consequence, and the agency from the State to perform those
                            duties is the next step in the creation of an office. It is the union of the two factors, duty and agency, which makes the office. State Prison v. Day, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 362</cite>,
                            32 S.E. 748, 46 L.R.A. 295 (1899).

                        <p>
                            Public Office Distinguished from Public Agency. - The most important characteristic which distinguishes an office from a public agency is that the conferring of the office carries with it a delegation to the individual of some of the sovereign functions
                            of the government. In this respect the terms "office" and "place of trust" as used in our Constitution are synonymous. Doyle v. Aldermen of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 133</cite>, 45 Am.
                            R. 677 (1883); State ex rel. Barnhill v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 493</cite>, 29 S.E. 720 (1898); State ex rel. Wooten v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 476</cite>, 59 S.E. 649 (1907).

                        <p>
                            Addition of Duties to Existing Office. - An act which merely attaches new duties to existing offices does not create a new office. McCullers v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 75</cite>, 73 S.E. 816 (1911).

                            Authority to Appoint to Office. - If a person is authorized to appoint to an office, this duty of itself constitutes him a public officer. State ex rel. Clark v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 59</cite>, 8 Am. R. 488
                            (1872); State ex rel. Howerton v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 546</cite> (1873).

                        <p>
                            Office Distinguished from Employment and Contract. - An "office" is defined by good authority as involving a delegation to the individual of some of the sovereign functions of government, to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public, by which
                            it is distinguished from "employment" or "contract." Eliason v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 235</cite> (1882); State ex rel. Barnhill v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 493</cite>,
                            29 S.E. 720 (1898).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A public office is an administrative agency or public employment, and although an office is an employment, it does not follow that every employment is an office. State ex rel. Wooten v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 476</cite>,
                            59 S.E. 649 (1907).

                        <p>
                            Officers Distinguished from Placemen. - The distinction between officers and placemen is that the former are required to take an oath to support the Constitutions of the State and of the United States, while the latter are not. Worthy v. Barrett,
                            <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 199</cite> (1869), appeal dismissed, 76 U.S. 611, 19 L. Ed. 565 (1870).

                        Sheriff's Agreement With Immigration and Customs Enforcement. - Trial court had no jurisdiction to issue writs of habeas corpus directing a sheriff to release prisoners detained at the request of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because the statute
                        authorizing the sheriff to detain the prisoners controlled over a more general statute preventing a sheriff from detaining a prisoner otherwise eligible for release. Chavez v. Carmichael, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite>                        196, 822 S.E.2d 131 (2018).

                        While a trial judge presented with an application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus has the authority to determine whether it is entitled to act upon any such petition, it should (1) summarily deny an application seeking the issuance of a writ
                        of habeas corpus that alleges that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government and (2) deny a petitioner's
                        request for discharge in the event that the return filed by a sheriff who has entered into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government claims that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant
                        or detainer. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139 (2020).

                    <p>
                        Ordering two habeas petitioners' release was error where they were held due to an immigration-related process by a sheriff who was a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. Thus, the court's state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness
                        of petitioners' detentions had been superseded by federal law. Although the trial court had authority to make an initial determination as to its authority, an examination of the applications themselves should have led it to summarily
                        deny the habeas corpus petitions. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139 (2020).

                        Theory of Appointments. - By the theory of our government, appointments to office are presumed to be made solely upon the principle detur digniori, and any practice whereby the bare consideration of money is brought to bear in any form upon such appointments
                        to or resignation of office conflicts with and degrades this great principle. The services performed under such appointments are paid for by salary or fees, presumed to be adjusted at the point of adequate remuneration only. Any
                        premium paid to obtain office interferes with this adjustment and tempts to speculation, overcharges and frauds in the effort to restore the balance thus disturbed. Basket v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 448</cite>,

                        Agreements Void. - Public offices are public trusts, and should be conferred solely upon considerations of ability, integrity, fidelity and fitness for the position. Agreements for compensation to procure these tend directly and necessarily to lower the
                        character of the appointments, to the great detriment of the public. Hence, such agreements, of whatever nature, have always been held void as being against public policy. Basket v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 448</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Acts of de facto officers, who exercise their office for a considerable length of time, are as effectual when they concern the rights of third persons or the public as if they were officers de jure. Hughes v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 52</cite>,

                            Usurping, De Facto and De Jure Officers Distinguished. - A usurper is one who takes possession without any authority. His acts are utterly void, unless he continues to act for so long a time or under such circumstances as to afford a presumption of his
                            right to act. And then his acts are valid as to the public and third persons. But he has no defense in a direct proceeding against himself. A de facto officer is one who goes in under color of authority or who exercises the
                            duties of the office so long or under such circumstances as to raise a presumption of his right, in which cases his necessary official acts are valid as to the public and third persons; but he may be ousted by a direct proceeding.
                            A de jure officer is one who is regularly and lawfully elected or appointed and inducted into office and exercises the duties as his right. All his necessary official acts are valid, and he cannot be ousted. The only difference
                            between an officer de facto and an officer de jure is that the former may be ousted in a direct proceeding against him, while the latter cannot be. So far as the public and third persons are concerned, there is no difference
                            whatever. The acts of one have precisely the same force and effect as the acts of the other. People ex rel. Norfleet v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 546</cite> (1875).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A mere intruder or usurper is not ordinarily, but may become, an officer de facto in some cases. This can happen only by the continued exercise of the office by him and the acquiescence therein by the public authorities and the public for such length
                            of time as to afford to citizens generally a strong presumption that he had been duly appointed. But when without color of authority he simply assumes to act, to exercise authority as an officer, and the public knows the fact,
                            or reasonably ought to know that he is a usurper, his acts are absolutely void for all purposes. The mere fact that, apart from his usurpation, his supposed official acts were fair and honest could not impart to them validity
                            and efficiency. Burke v. Elliott, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 355</cite> (1844); People ex rel. Norfleet v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 546</cite> (1875); State ex rel. Van Amringe v.

                        <p>
                            A usurper in office is distinguished from a de facto officer in that a usurper takes possession of office and undertakes to act officially without any authority, either actual or apparent. Since he is not an officer at all or for any purpose, his acts
                            are absolutely void, and they can be impeached at any time in any proceeding. People ex rel. Duncan v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 713</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 796 (1978).

                            To constitute one an officer de facto there must be an actual exercise of the office and acquiescence of the public authorities long enough to cause, in the mind of the citizen, a strong presumption that the officer was duly appointed. Hughes v. Long,
                            <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 52</cite>, 25 S.E. 743 (1896).

                        <p>
                            The indispensable basis of being a de facto officer is that there is such an office. State v. Shuford, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 588</cite>, 38 S.E. 808 (1901).

                            An officer de facto is one whose acts, though not those of a lawful officer, the law, upon principles of policy and justice, will hold valid, so far as they involve the interests of the public and third persons, where the duties of the office were exercised
                            (1) without a known appointment or election, but under such circumstances of reputation or acquiescence as were calculated to induce people, without inquiry, to submit to or revoke his action, supposing him to be the officer
                            he assumed to be; (2) under color of a known and valid appointment or election, but where the officer failed to conform to some precedent requirement or condition, such as taking an oath, giving a bond, or the like; (3) under
                            color of a known election or appointment, void because there was a want of power in the electing or appointing body, or by reason of some defect or irregularity in its exercise, such ineligibility, want of power or defect being
                            unknown to the public; (4) under color of an election or appointment, by or pursuant to a public unconstitutional law, before the same is adjudged to be such. State v.

                            A judge de facto is defined as one who occupies a judicial office under some color of right, and for the time being performs its duties with public acquiescence, though having no right in fact. In order for one to be deemed a judge de facto, he must have
                            satisfied the following four conditions: (1) He assumes to be the judge of a court which is established by law; (2) he is in possession of the judicial office in question, and is discharging its duties; (3) his incumbency of
                            the judicial office is illegal in some respects; and (4) he has at least a fair color of right or title to the judicial office, or has acted as its occupant for so long a time and under such circumstances of reputation or acquiescence
                            by the public generally as are calculated to afford a presumption of his right to act and to induce people, without inquiry, to submit to or invoke official action on his part on the supposition that he is the judge he assumes
                            to be. People ex rel. Duncan v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 713</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 796 (1978).

                            So far as the public and third persons are concerned, a judge de facto is competent to do whatever may be done by a judge de jure. In consequence, acts done by a judge de facto in the discharge of the duties of his judicial office are as effectual so
                            far as the rights of third persons or the public are concerned as if he were a judge de jure. People ex rel. Duncan v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 713</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 796 (1978).

                            A Judge De Jure. - A judge de jure exercises the office of judge as a matter of right. In order to become a judge de jure one must satisfy three requirements: (1) He must possess the legal qualifications for the judicial office in question; (2) he must
                            be lawfully chosen to such office; and (3) he must have qualified himself to perform the duties of such office according to the mode prescribed by law. People ex rel. Duncan v. Beach, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 713</cite>,

                            Injunction is not the proper method of trying title to an office, and it will not lie at the suit of the incumbent of a public office to restrain a claimant of the office from claiming and exercising its powers and duties. Patterson v. Hubbs,
                            <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 119</cite> (1871); Jones v. Commissioners of Granville, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 280</cite> (1877).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The erroneous action of the county commissioners in declaring an office vacant because of an apparent tie vote, and ordering a new election, does not warrant the granting of an injunction to one of the candidates, since the title to the office can be
                            inquired into by quo warranto even after such a new election. Cozart v. Fleming, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 547</cite>, 31 S.E. 822 (1898).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Injunction does not lie to restrain county commissioners from declaring a public office vacant because of an apparent tie vote where it is an attempt, in effect, to try the title to the office by injunction, which is not permissible. Cozart v. Fleming,
                            <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. 547</cite>, 31 S.E. 822 (1898).

                            Proceeding Is in Nature of Quo Warranto. - Title to a public office cannot be tried by motion, but must be determined by a proceeding in the nature of quo warranto. Sneed v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. 282</cite>                            (1877).

                            Who May Bring Action. - An action to try the right of an incumbent to any public office may be brought by the Attorney General upon his own information, or upon the complaint of any private party. People ex rel. Cloud v. Wilson,

                            Any person having a right to an office can, in his own name, bring an action for the purpose of testing his right as against one claiming adversely. Brown v. Turner, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 93</cite> (1874).

                            in court, cognizant of what was going on, and did not object thereto, but surrendered up the office and records to the new clerk and retired from the performance of the duties of the office for 12 months thereafter, it was
                            held, in an action in the nature of quo warranto, that such conduct in the old clerk amounted to a surrender of his office to the court, and justified the reception and induction into office of the newly elected clerk. Williams

                        appointed. Therefore, because the commissioner's appointment was void before the opinion and award were entered, and because the commissioner's concurrence in the opinion and award was not the act of a qualified officer - neither
                        de jure nor de facto - the concurrence was a nullity. Baxter v. Danny Nicholson, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 168, 661 S.E.2d 892 (2008).

                        Holding Over Until Successor Takes Oath. - Although an industrial commissioner had been notified that his service was at an end and that his successor had been appointed, a decision awarding workers' compensation benefits was within the commissioner's

                        The mayor of a municipality was constituted a special court for the municipality by valid act (Chapter 144, Private Laws of 1913). A duly elected and qualified mayor assumed the duties as judge of the special court under claim of authority. By

                        no other office. The town commissioners failed to appoint a judge under the provisions of this act. It was held that a sentence imposed by the mayor acting as judge of the special court cannot be collaterally attacked in habeas
                        corpus since he was at least a judge de facto if not de jure. In re Wingler, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 560</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 372 (1950).

                <p>
                    When an official of a county, city or town is liable upon his bond for unlawfully and wrongfully retaining by virtue of his office a fund, or a part thereof, to which the county, city or town is entitled, any citizen and taxpayer may, in his own name
                    for the benefit of the county, city or town, institute suit and recover from the delinquent official the fund so retained. Any county commissioners, aldermen, councilmen or governing board who fraudulently, wrongfully and unlawfully
                    permit an official so to retain funds shall be personally liable therefor; any citizen and taxpayer may, in his own name for the benefit of the county, city or town, institute suit and recover from such county commissioners, aldermen,
                    councilmen, or governing board, the fund so retained. Before instituting suit under this section, the citizen and taxpayer shall file a statement before the county commissioners, treasurer, or other officers authorized by law to institute
                    the suit, setting forth the fund alleged to be retained or permitted to be retained, and demanding that suit be instituted by the authorities authorized to sue within 60 days. The citizen and taxpayer so suing shall receive one-third
                    part, up to the sum of five hundred dollars ($500.00), of the amount recovered, to indemnify him for his services, but the amount received by the taxpayer and citizen as indemnity shall in no case exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00).

                        their duties in this respect. Weaver v. Hampton, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 798</cite>, 161 S.E. 480 (1931).

                        the recovery, it was held that after a recovery by plaintiffs and the entry of a consent judgment dismissing the appeals, wherein no mention was made of indemnifying plaintiffs for their services, the resident judge was without
                        authority to entertain a petition of one of the original taxpayer plaintiffs for such reimbursement. Hill v. Stansbury, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 356</cite>, 30 S.E.2d 150 (1944).

                        by law, where the evidence tended to show that the county treasurer's salary was fixed at $1,800 a year in 1927, and that in 1931, agreeable to the Machinery Act of that year, the commissioners designated the county treasurer to
                        receive tax prepayments and for this extra service allowed him $1,200 per year additional, and again in 1939 allowed him $240 more per year, both without legislative authority, judgment of nonsuit as to the commissioners was properly
                        allowed under the express provisions of this section, there being no evidence of bad faith, etc., while such judgment as to the county treasurer was reversed. Hill v. Stansbury, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 193</cite>,

                        Statutory Factors Not Present. - This section does not create an initial cause of action against commissioners, but rather establishes a derivative remedy, requiring both retained funds by a bonded officer and refusal to act by commissioners. The allegations
                        and the pleadings indicate that neither of these factors were present in action wherein county commissioners expended county funds to produce and distribute information concerning referenda regarding redistricting and merger or
                        nonmerger of county public schools. Bardolph v. Arnold, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 435 S.E.2d 109, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 552</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 141 (1993), cert.

                        for such misbehavior, notwithstanding the fact that he failed to take the oath of office. State v. Cansler, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 442</cite> (1876).

                    <p>
                        Sufficiency of Evidence. - Under this section as it stood before the 1973 amendment, it was held that the evidence in proceedings to remove a prosecuting attorney from office under this section was sufficient to sustain an order removing him when he admitted
                        that he attempted to induce, and did induce, a person to violate the statutes of the State in participating in acts made an offense for immorality, etc., whatever his intent may have been therein. State ex rel. Hyatt v. Hamme,
                        <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 684</cite>, 104 S.E. 174 (1920), wherein it was also held that defendant could not complain because he was removed not in accordance with the specifications alleged in the petition, but upon his own
                        evidence.

                    <p>
                        Hearing Required. - Because of the severe adverse consequences possible for the office holder in an action under this Article, fundamental fairness entitles such office holder to a hearing which meets the basic requirements of due process, requirements
                        which must include adequate time and opportunity to prepare to respond to the accusations against him. State ex rel. Leonard v. Huskey, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 309 S.E.2d 726 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Jury Not Required. - The proceedings under this section do not require an issue to be submitted to the jury. A public office is not a property right under former N.C. Const., Art. I,
                        <span class="s1">

                        Time of Trial. - Although this Article requires a prompt trial, its terms are broad enough to allow the trial court to set the time of trial within his discretion, considering, among other things, the nature of the charges brought and the terms of court
                        available for trial. State ex rel. Leonard v. Huskey, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 309 S.E.2d 726 (1983).

                        Appeal from Superior Court. - An appeal from the judgment of the superior court judge that a prosecuting attorney be removed for "willful misconduct or maladministration in office," etc., is upon questions of law and legal inferences, if justified by
                        the findings of facts supported by evidence, N.C. Const., Art. VI,

                        Enjoining Vacating of Office by Commissioners Before They Have Qualified. - An action to enjoin newly elected county commissioners, who had not yet qualified, from declaring a public office vacant, and electing a successor, is properly dismissed as premature.

                    In the trial of the cause in the superior court the cause shall be advanced and take precedence over all other causes upon the court calendar, and shall be heard at the next session after the petition is filed, provided the proceedings are filed in said
                    court in time for said action to be heard. The superior court shall fix the time of hearing. If the final termination of such proceedings be favorable to any accused officer, said officer shall be allowed the reasonable and necessary
                    expense, including a reasonable attorney fee, to be fixed by the judge, he has incurred in making his defense, by the county, if he be a county officer, or by the city or town in which he holds office, if he be a city officer. If the
                    action is instituted upon the complaint of citizens as herein provided, and it appears to the court that there was no reasonable cause for filing the complaint, the costs may be taxed against the complaining parties.

                    to all retirees who elected not to be covered under this benefit or who failed to make any election at the time of their retirement and shall send a second notice by U.S. mail to any such retiree who fails to make an election within
                    60 days of the notification of the open enrollment period. Notice, at minimum, shall consist of notification of the open enrollment period and the consequences of failure to respond within the specified time frames, informational materials
                    explaining the benefit program and the associated costs, and a preprinted personalized enrollment application to facilitate the enrollment process indicating each individual retiree's contribution rate. The contribution rate for retirees
                    electing coverage during the open enrollment period shall be increased by eleven and one-tenth percent (11.1%) the rate established for retirees who elected coverage when first eligible, at retirement. For retirees electing coverage
                    during this open enrollment period, coverage shall become effective the first of the month following the month in which the election of coverage is received by the Retirement Systems Division but not before February 1, 2008. Contribution
                    rates for coverage shall be based upon the retiree's nearest age as of the effective date of coverage and shall begin by deduction from the retiree's net monthly retirement allowance in the month in which coverage becomes effective.
                    Coverage elected by retirees during this open enrollment period shall be subject to all other laws and rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees governing the Contributory Death Benefit for Retired Members."

                    A Retirement System is hereby established and placed under the management of the Board of Trustees for the purpose of providing retirement allowances and other benefits under the provisions of this Article for employees of those counties, cities and towns
                    or other eligible employers participating in the said Retirement System. Following the filing of the application as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t128a03s128-23ol1c" target="_self">G.S. 128-23(c)</a></cite>,
                    the Board shall set a date, effective the first day of a calendar quarter, not more than 90 days thereafter, as of which date participation of the employer may begin, which date shall be known as the date of participation for such
                    employer: Provided, that in the judgment of the Board of Trustees an adequate number of persons have indicated their intention to participate; otherwise at such later date as the Board of Trustees may set.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This Retirement System is a governmental plan, within the meaning of Section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. Therefore, the nondiscrimination rules of Sections 401(a)(5) and 401(a)(26) of the Code do not apply. This System shall have the power and
                    privileges of a corporation and shall be known as the "North Carolina Local Governmental Employees' Retirement System," and by such name all of its business shall be transacted, all of its funds invested, and all of its cash and securities
                    and other property held.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consistent with Section 401(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, all contributions from participating employers and participating employees to this Retirement System shall be made to funds held in trust through trust instruments that have the purposes
                    of distributing trust principal and income to retired members and their beneficiaries and of paying other definitely determinable benefits under this Chapter, after meeting the necessary expenses of administering this Retirement System.
                    Neither the trust corpus nor income from this trust can be used for purposes other than the exclusive benefit of members or their beneficiaries, except that employer contributions made to the trust under a good faith mistake of fact
                    may be returned to an employer, where the refund can occur within less than one year after the mistaken contribution was made, consistent with the rule adopted by the Board of Trustees. The Retirement System shall have a consolidated
                    Plan document, consisting of Article V, Section 6(2) of the North Carolina Constitution, relevant statutory provisions in this Chapter, associated regulations in the North Carolina Administrative Code, substantive and procedural information
                    on the official forms used by the Retirement System, and policies and minutes of the Board of Trustees.

                    accumulation fund. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account.

                <p>
                    Creditable service allowed under this subdivision shall be only for the initial period of "active duty", as defined in 38 U.S. Code Section 101(21), in the Armed Forces of the United States up to the date the member was first eligible to be separated
                    and released and for subsequent periods of "active duty", as defined in 38 U.S. Code Section 101(21), as required by the Armed Forces of the United States up to the date of first eligibility for separation or release, but shall not
                    include periods of active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States creditable in any other retirement system except the National Guard or any reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States, and shall not include periods
                    of "active duty for training", as defined in 38 U.S. Code Section 101(22), or periods of "inactive duty training", as defined in 38 U.S. Code Section 101(23), rendered in any reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States.
                    Provided, creditable service may be allowed only for active duty in the Armed Forces of the United States of a member that resulted in a general or honorable discharge from duty. The member shall submit satisfactory evidence of the
                    service claimed. For purposes of this subsection, membership service may include any membership or prior service credits transferred to this Retirement System pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t128a03s128-24" target="_self">G.S. 128-24</a></cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Current membership service shall mean membership service earned since the service previously rendered to any state, territory, or other governmental subdivision of the United States other than this State. Creditable service under this subsection shall
                    be allowed only at the rate of one year of out-of-state service for each year of service in this State, with a maximum allowable of 10 years of out-of-state service. Such service is limited to full-time service which would be allowable
                    under the laws governing this System. Credit will be allowed only if no benefit is allowable in another public retirement system as a result of the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Creditable service under this subsection shall be allowed only at the rate of one year of out-of-state service for each year of membership service in this State, with a maximum allowable of five years of out-of-state service. Such service is limited to
                    full-time service that would be allowable under the laws governing this Retirement System. Credit will be allowed only if no benefit is allowable in another public retirement system as a result of the service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subject to the requirements of this subsection, an employer may pay all or part of the cost of a service purchase of a member in service. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the employer, the cost paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension
                    accumulation fund. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whenever the creditable service purchased pursuant to this subsection is for a period that occurs during the four consecutive calendar years that would have produced the highest average annual compensation pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t128a03s128-21" target="_self">G.S. 128-21(5)</a></cite>                    had the member not been on leave of absence without pay, then the compensation that the member would have received during the purchased period shall be included in calculating the member's average final compensation. In such cases,
                    the compensation that the member would have received during the purchased period shall be based on the annual rate of compensation of the member immediately prior to the leave of absence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the case of a law enforcement officer electing to purchase service under this section who is in receipt of benefits under the North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act due to serious bodily injury suffered in the line of duty as a result of an intentional
                    or unlawful act of another, as certified by the head of the employing law enforcement agency, and whose approved leave of absence terminates on or before a return to service on and after August 1, 2006, the employer percentage rate
                    of contribution payable under subdivision (2) of this subsection shall be made by the employer that granted the leave of absence. The cost to the law enforcement officer shall be reduced by the amount paid by the employer. For purposes
                    of this subsection, "serious bodily injury" means bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death, or that causes serious permanent disfigurement, coma, a permanent or protracted condition that causes extreme pain, or permanent
                    or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ, or that results in prolonged hospitalization.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing in this subsection prevents an employer from voluntarily paying all or a part of the employee portion of the total cost of the service credit purchased, and the employer does not discriminate against any eligible law enforcement officer in this
                    subsection employed by the employer by paying that portion of cost. To the extent paid by the employer, the employee portion paid by the employer shall be credited to the Pension Accumulation Fund; to the extent paid by the member,
                    the employee portion paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account. A member shall pay any part of the employee portion of the total cost not paid by the employer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent an employer or member from paying all or a part of the cost of the omitted membership service; and to the extent paid by the employer, the cost paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension accumulation
                    fund; and to the extent paid by the member, the cost paid by the members shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account; provided, however, an employer does not discriminate against any member or group of members in his
                    employ in paying all or any part of the cost of the omitted membership service. In the event an employer pays all or a part of the full actuarial cost as determined in subdivision (3) of this subsection, the employer may, at its option,
                    pay such amount either in a lump sum or by increasing its "accrued liability contribution" for the remainder of its accrued liability period. In the event an employer has satisfied its accrued liability contribution, the employer may
                    amortize its portion of the full actuarial cost over a period not to exceed ten years. The expense of making an actuarial valuation to determine the accrued liability contribution or the additional accrued liability contribution, required
                    to amortize the portion of the full actuarial cost paid by the employer, shall be paid by the employer in a lump sum at the time of the actuarial valuation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subject to the requirements of this subsection, an employer may pay all or part of the cost of a service purchase of a member in service. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the employer, the cost paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension
                    accumulation fund. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On or before December 31, 2021, members may also purchase creditable service for periods of employment with public community service entities within the State funded entirely with federal funds, other than the federal government, that are not covered
                    by the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t128a03s128-21" target="_self">G.S. 128-21(11)</a></cite> or <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.135.html#t135a01s135-1" target="_blank">G.S. 135-1(11)</a></cite>,
                    under the same terms and conditions that are applicable to the purchase of creditable service for periods of federal employment in accordance with this subsection. "Public community service entities" as used in this subsection shall
                    mean community action, human relations, manpower development, and community development programs as defined in Articles 19 and 21 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160A</a></cite> and
                    Article 18 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 153A</a></cite> of the General Statutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment for service purchased under this subsection shall be made in a single lump sum in an amount calculated by applying the ratio of actual gross compensation earned as a part-time employee to the gross compensation that would have been earned as a
                    full-time employee to the period of service rendered in months. The member shall purchase this service by paying a lump sum amount to the Annuity Savings Fund equal to the full liability increase due to the additional service credits
                    on the basis of the assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the liabilities of the Retirement System, except for the following assumptions specific to this calculation: (i) the allowance shall be assumed to
                    commence at the earliest age at which the member could retire on an unreduced retirement allowance and (ii) assumed annual postretirement allowance increases as set by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary.
                    The calculation of the amount payable shall also include an administrative fee to be set by the Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Board of Trustees shall adopt rules regarding how much service in any year, as based on compensation, is equivalent to one year of service in proportion to earnable compensation, but in no case shall more than one year of service be creditable for
                    all service in one year. Service rendered for the regular school year in any district shall be equivalent to one year of service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subject to the requirements of this subsection, an employer may pay all or part of the cost of a service purchase of a member in service. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the employer, the cost paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension
                    accumulation fund. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Provided, the member shall purchase this service by making a lump sum amount payable to the Annuity Savings Fund equal to the full liability of the service credits calculated on the basis of the assumptions used for purposes of the actuarial valuation
                    of the liabilities of the retirement system, and the calculation of the amount payable shall take into account the retirement allowance arising on account of the additional service credit commencing at the earliest age at which the
                    member could retire on an unreduced retirement allowance, as determined by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary, plus an administrative fee to be set by the Board of Trustees. In no instance shall the amount
                    payable be less than the contributions a member would have made during the employment plus four percent (4%) interest compounded annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection that provide for the purchase of service credits, the terms "full cost", "full liability", and "full actuarial cost" include assumed annual post-retirement allowance increases, as determined
                    by the Board of Trustees, from the earliest age at which a member could retire on an unreduced service allowance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent an employer or member from paying all or a part of the cost of the probationary employment; and to the extent paid by the employer, the cost paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension accumulation
                    fund; and to the extent paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account; provided, however, an employer does not discriminate against any member or group of members in its current
                    employ in paying all or any part of the cost of the probationary employment. In the event an employer pays all or a part of the full actuarial cost, the employer may, at its option, pay such amount either in a lump sum or by increasing
                    its "accrued liability contribution" for the remainder of its accrued liability period. In the event an employer has satisfied its accrued liability contribution, the employer may amortize its portion of the full actuarial cost over
                    a period not to exceed 10 years. The expense of making an actuarial valuation to determine the accrued liability contribution or the additional accrued liability contribution, required to amortize the portion of the full actuarial
                    cost paid by the employer, shall be paid by the employer in a lump sum at the time of the actuarial valuation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The member shall purchase this service by paying a lump sum amount to the Annuity Savings Fund equal to the full liability increase due to the additional service credits on the basis of the assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuation
                    of the liabilities of the Retirement System, except for the following assumptions specific to this calculation: (i) the allowance shall be assumed to commence at the earliest age at which the member could retire on an unreduced retirement
                    allowance and (ii) assumed annual postretirement allowance increases as set by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary. The increases as set by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting actuary
                    shall also include an administrative fee to be set by the Board.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subject to the requirements of this subsection, an employer may pay all or part of the cost of a service purchase of a member in service. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the employer, the cost paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension
                    accumulation fund. To the extent that the purchase is paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account.

                <p>
                    The amount of creditable service purchased under this subsection may not exceed a total of five years. A member shall purchase this service by making a lump sum payment into the Annuity Savings Fund equal to the full liability increase due to the additional
                    service credits on the basis of the assumptions used for the purposes of the actuarial valuation of the liabilities of the Retirement System, except for the following assumptions specific to this calculation: (i) the allowance shall
                    be assumed to commence at the earliest age at which the member could retire on an unreduced retirement allowance and (ii) assumed annual postretirement allowance increases as set by the Board of Trustees upon the advice of the consulting
                    actuary. The calculation of the amount payable shall also include an administrative fee to be set by the Board.

                    of Trustees, purchase such service credits through a direct transfer to the Annuity Savings Fund of funds from (i) an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code or (ii) an eligible plan under Section
                    457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state.

                    Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent an employer or member from paying all or a part of the cost of the retroactive membership service; and to the extent paid by the employer, the cost paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension
                    accumulation fund; and to the extent paid by the member, the cost paid by the member shall be credited to the member's annuity savings account; provided, however, an employer does not discriminate against any member or group of members
                    in his employ in paying all or any part of the cost of the retroactive membership service.

                    service which would be allowable under the laws governing this System. Credit will be allowed only if no benefit is allowable in another public retirement system as the result of the service. Payment shall be permitted only on a total

                        "Creditable Service." - Superior court erred in granting partial summary judgment awarding a sheriff a special separation allowance for 36 years of creditable service through two North Carolina retirement systems, state and local, because the sheriff
                        was not a member of the state system when he retired where, prior to his retirement from the sheriff's department, he began receiving retirement benefits from that system, and the sheriff was only entitled to credit for his 12
                        years of service under the local system where the county never issued the sheriff a prior service certificate, the sheriff never transferred membership of his state service to the local system, and the county never gave the sheriff
                        credit for prior service. Lovin v. Cherokee Cnty., <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 789 S.E.2d 869 (2016).

                                earned as an employee during the 12 consecutive months in the final 48 months of service prior to retirement producing the highest gross compensation excluding any compensation received on account of termination. If the

                    in a lump sum to the person or persons the member has designated as the contingent beneficiary for return of accumulated contributions, if the person or persons are living at the time the payment falls due, otherwise to the principal
                    beneficiary's legal representative. For purposes of this paragraph, the term "accumulated contributions" includes amounts of employee voluntary contributions that were transferred from the Supplemental Retirement Income Plan of North

                    The minimum increase pursuant to this subsection (j) shall be five dollars ($5.00) per month; provided that, if an optional benefit has been elected, said minimum shall be reduced actuarially as determined by the Board and shall be applicable to a retired
                    member, if surviving, otherwise to his designated beneficiary under the option elected.

                    As of December 31, 1970, the ratio of the Consumer Price Index to such index one year earlier shall be determined. If such ratio indicates an increase of at least one per centum (1%), each beneficiary on the retirement rolls as of July 1, 1970, shall
                    be entitled to have his allowance increased effective July 1, 1971, as follows:

                    As of December 31, 1971, an increase in retirement allowances shall be calculated and made effective July 1, 1972, in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. As of December 31 of each year after 1971, the ratio (R) of the Consumer Price Index
                    to such index one year earlier shall be determined, and each beneficiary on the retirement rolls as of July 1 of the year of determination shall be entitled to have his allowance increased effective on July 1 of the year following
                    the year of determination by the same percentage of increase indicated by the ratio (R) calculated to the nearest tenth of one per centum (1/10 of 1%), but not more than four per centum (4%); provided that any such increase in allowances
                    shall be contingent upon the total fund providing sufficient investment gains to cover the additional actuarial liabilities on account of such increase. The determination of whether there are sufficient investment gains to cover the
                    possible postretirement increase in allowance shall reside exclusively within the discretion of the Board of Trustees and shall be informed by the findings within the annual actuarial valuation reports. In considering whether to grant
                    a postretirement increase, the Board of Trustees shall take into account both the rate of inflation as determined by the Consumer Price Index and the record of investment gains or losses during the preceding three-year period.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The allowance of a surviving annuitant of a beneficiary whose allowance is increased under this subsection shall, when and if payable, be increased by the same per centum.

                    Notwithstanding the foregoing linkage between increases in the Consumer Price Index and correlative contingent increases in retirement benefits determined by the availability of sufficient investment gains to cover the additional actuarial liabilities
                    arising from those increased benefits, the Board of Trustees, may in any year, considering an increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index, fund a cost-of-living increase in a percentage amount, measured in tenths of one percent (1/10
                    of 1%), of up to four percent (4%), provided that the Board may use only investment gains to fund such an increase.

                    subject to a minimum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000) and a maximum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000). Such death benefit shall be payable apart and separate from the payment of the member's accumulated contributions under the System on his
                    death pursuant to the provisions of subsection (f) of this section. For the purpose of the Plan, a member shall be deemed to be in service at the date of his death if his death occurs within 180 days from the last day of his actual

                    Notwithstanding the above provisions, the Board of Trustees may and is specifically authorized to provide the death benefit according to the terms and conditions otherwise appearing in this Plan in the form of group life insurance, either (i) by purchasing
                    a contract or contracts of group life insurance with any life insurance company or companies licensed and authorized to transact business in this State for the purpose of insuring the lives of members in service, or (ii) by establishing
                    a separate trust fund qualified under section 501(c)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended, for such purpose. To that end the Board of Trustees is authorized, empowered and directed to investigate the desirability of
                    utilizing group life insurance by either of the foregoing methods for the purpose of providing the death benefit. If a separate trust fund is established, it shall be operated in accordance with rules and regulations adopted by the
                    Board of Trustees and all investment earnings on the trust fund shall be credited to such fund.

                    The Board of Trustees may establish a minimum amount that must be transferred if a transfer is elected. The member may elect a special retirement allowance with no postretirement increases or a special retirement allowance with annual
                    postretirement increases equal to the annual increase in the U.S. Consumer Price Index. Postretirement increases on any other allowance will not apply to the special retirement allowance. The Board of Trustees shall provide educational
                    materials to the members who apply for the transfer authorized by this section. Those materials shall describe the special retirement allowance and shall explain the relationship between the transferred balance and the monthly benefit
                    and how the member's heirs may be impacted by the election to make this transfer and any costs and fees involved.

                    For the purpose of determining the special retirement allowance, the Board of Trustees shall adopt straight life annuity factors on the basis of yields on U.S. Treasury Bonds and mortality and such other tables as may be necessary based upon actual experience.
                    A single set of mortality and such other tables will be used for all members, with factors differing only based on the age of the member and the election of postretirement increases. The Board of Trustees shall modify the mortality
                    and such other tables every five years, as shall be deemed necessary, based upon the five-year experience study as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t128a03s128-28ol1o" target="_self">G.S. 128-28(o)</a></cite>.

                    on the special retirement allowance the same as if that special retirement allowance had been paid directly by the eligible plan or the plan through which the transfer was made, whichever is most favorable to the member. The Local
                    Governmental Employees' Retirement System shall be responsible to determine the taxable amount, if any, and report accordingly.

                    the actual cost of the administrative expenses relating to these transfers. An eligible plan shall not assess a fee specifically relating to a transfer of accumulated contributions authorized under this subsection. This provision shall
                    not prohibit other fees that may be assessable under the plan. Each plan, contract, account, or annuity shall fully disclose to any member participating in a transfer under this subsection any surrender charges or other fees, and that
                    disclosure shall be made contemporaneous with the initiation of the transfer by the member.

                    his employer. This deduction, however, shall not reduce his compensation as defined in subdivision (7a) of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t128a03s128-21" target="_self">G.S. 128-21</a></cite>. Picked-up contributions
                    shall be transmitted to the System monthly for the preceding month by means of a warrant drawn by the employer and payable to the Local Governmental Employees' Retirement System and shall be accompanied by a schedule of the picked-up
                    contributions on such forms as may be prescribed. In the case of a failure to fulfill these conditions the provisions of subsection (g)(3) of this section shall apply.

                <p>
                    For members or beneficiaries electing to make the employee contributions on the retroactive adjustment in compensation or on the underreported compensation, the member's or beneficiary's employer, which granted the retroactive promotion or erred in underreporting
                    compensation and contributions, shall make the required employer contributions. Nothing contained in this subsection shall prevent an employer from paying all or a part of the interest assessed on the employee contributions; and to
                    the extent paid by the employer, the interest paid by the employer shall be credited to the pension accumulation fund; provided, however, an employer does not discriminate against any member or beneficiary or group of members or beneficiaries
                    in his employ in paying all or any part of the interest assessed on the employee contributions due.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the event the retroactive adjustment in compensation or the underreported compensation is for a period that occurs during the four consecutive calendar years that would have produced the highest average annual compensation pursuant to

                    or beneficiary's average final compensation only in the event the appropriate employee and employer contributions are paid on such compensation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An employer error in underreporting compensation shall not include a retroactive increase in compensation that occurs during the four consecutive calendar years that would have produced the highest average annual compensation pursuant to
                    <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.135.html#t135a01s135-1" target="_blank">G.S. 135-1(5)</a></cite>, for reasons other than a wrongfully denied promotional opportunity or wrongful demotion where the member is promoted or
                    the demotion is reversed retroactively.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under such rules as the Board of Trustees shall adopt, the Retirement System shall report monthly to each employer a list of those members for whom the employer made a contribution to the Retirement System in the preceding month that are most likely to
                    require an additional employer contribution should they elect to retire in the following 12 months, if applicable. Reports received under this section shall not be public records. Employers or former employers in receipt of a report
                    under this section shall treat the report, and the information contained within that report, as confidential and as though it were still held by the Retirement System under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t128a03s128-33.1" target="_self">G.S. 128-33.1</a></cite>.

                    date set by the Board of Trustees, the Board shall notify the State Treasurer of its intent to collect the delinquent contributions and other payments due to the Retirement Systems Division and request an interception of State appropriations
                    due to the participating employer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Except as provided in this subdivision, upon notification by the Board of Trustees to the State Treasurer and the Office of State Budget and Management as to the default of the employer, the Office of State Budget and Management shall withhold from any
                    State appropriation due to that employer an amount equal to the sum of all delinquent contributions and other debts due to the Retirement Systems Division and shall transmit that amount to the Retirement Systems Division. For the purposes
                    of this subsection, the date set by the Board of Trustees for payment of the contribution-based benefit cap liability shall be 12 months after the member's effective date of retirement.

                    about retirement benefits was intended to be included among those records required to be maintained for public inspection by each department, agency, institution, commission, and bureau of the State and that as a result the Retirement
                    Systems Division of the Department of the State Treasurer makes that information available for public inspection and examination. The General Assembly finds that the interests of clarity require statutory language providing guidance
                    to the Retirement Systems Division in determining and maintaining consistency as to what information should be made available about the retirement accounts of State and local employees."

                        This subsection applies to distributions and rollovers from the Plan. The Plan does not have mandatory distributions within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Internal Revenue Code. With respect to distributions from the Plan and notwithstanding
                        any other provision of the Plan to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this Article, a distributee (including, after December 31, 2006, a non-spouse beneficiary if that non-spouse beneficiary
                        elects a direct rollover only to an inherited traditional or Roth IRA as permitted under applicable federal law) may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan administrator, to have any portion of an eligible
                        rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. As used in this subsection, an "eligible retirement plan" means an individual retirement account described in
                        Section 408(a) of the Code, an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code, an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code, on and after January 1, 2009, a Roth IRA, or a qualified trust described
                        in Section 401(a) of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. Effective on and after January 1, 2002, an eligible retirement plan also means an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the
                        Code and an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code that is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately
                        account for amounts transferred into that plan from this Plan. As used in this subsection, a "direct rollover" is a payment by the Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. Provided, an eligible rollover
                        distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution shall not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially
                        equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary,
                        or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income (determined
                        without regard to the exclusion for net realized appreciation with respect to employer securities). Effective as of January 1, 2002, and notwithstanding the exclusion of any after-tax portion from such a rollover distribution in
                        the preceding sentence, a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible in gross income. That portion
                        may be transferred, pursuant to applicable federal law, to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or (b) of the Code, to a qualified defined benefit plan, or to a qualified defined contribution
                        plan described in Section 401(a), 403(a), or 403(b) of the Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income
                        and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible. The definition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate
                        payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in Section 414(p) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a court-ordered equitable distribution of marital property, as provided under G.S. 50-20.1. Effective on and after
                        January 1, 2007, notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, a nonspouse beneficiary of a deceased member may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the administrator of the Board of Trustees of this Retirement
                        System, to directly roll over any portion of the beneficiary's distribution from the Retirement System; however, such rollover shall conform with the provisions of section 402(c)(11) of the Code.

                    Any elective or appointive State official may obtain leave of absence from the official's duties for protracted illness or other reason satisfactory to the Governor, for such period as the Governor may designate. The leave shall be obtained only upon
                    application by the official and with the consent of the Governor. The official shall receive no salary during the period of leave unless the leave of absence is granted by reason of protracted illness, in which event the granting of
                    a leave of absence shall not deprive the official of the benefits of cumulative sick leave to which the official may be entitled under rules and regulations adopted pursuant to G.S. 143-37 or to which he may otherwise be entitled by
                    law. The period of leave may be extended upon application to and with the approval of the Governor if the reason for the original leave still exists, and it may be shortened if the reason shall unexpectedly terminate: Provided, that
                    no leave or extension thereof shall operate to extend the term of office of any official beyond the period for which the official was elected or appointed. If, by reason of the length of the period of absence or the nature of the duties
                    of the official, the Governor deems it necessary, the Governor may appoint any citizen of the State, without regard to residence or district, as a temporary replacement for the period of the official's leave of absence. This appointee
                    shall have all the authority, duties, perquisites, and emoluments of the official temporarily replaced. The appointee shall possess all the qualifications required by law for holding the office for which the temporary replacement official
                    is appointed.
