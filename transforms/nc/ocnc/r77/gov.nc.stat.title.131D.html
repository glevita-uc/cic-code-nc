      </b>
      - Session Laws 2009-232, s. 2, repealed Session Laws 2009-232, s. 1, contingent on House Bill 456, 2009 Regular Session, becoming law. House Bill 456 was enacted as Session Laws 2009-462. Therefore the amendment by Session Laws 2009-232, s. 1, which would have amended subdivision (b)(1a)b by deleting "and perform any required follow-up inspection" at the end of the first sentence, did not take effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2009-451, s. 10.76(a), effective August 14, 2009 until the repeal of this section, in subdivision (b)(1), in the introductory language, substituted "three hundred fifteen dollars ($315.00)" for "two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)" in the third sentence, and in the fourth sentence, substituted "three hundred sixty dollars ($360.00)" for "three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00)" near the middle, and "seventeen dollars and fifty cents ($17.50)" for "twelve dollars and fifty cents ($12.50)" at the end.

     <p>
      As used in this Article:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol11">
       Abuse. - The willful or grossly negligent infliction of physical pain, injury, or mental anguish, unreasonable confinement, or the willful or grossly negligent deprivation by the administrator or staff of an adult care home of services which are necessary to maintain mental and physical health.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol12">
       Administrator. - A person approved by the Department of Health and Human Services as an assisted living administrator under G.S. 90-288.14 or as an adult care home administrator under G.S. 90-288.14A, who has the responsibility for the total operation of a licensed adult care home.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol13">
       Adult care home. -  An assisted living residence in which the housing management provides 24-hour scheduled and unscheduled personal care services to two or more residents, either directly or for scheduled needs, through formal written agreement with licensed home care or hospice agencies. Some licensed adult care homes provide supervision to persons with cognitive impairments whose decisions, if made independently, may jeopardize the safety or well-being of themselves or others and therefore require supervision. Medication in an adult care home may be administered by designated trained staff. Adult care homes that provide care to two to six unrelated residents are commonly called family care homes.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol1-3a">
       Adult care home resident discharge team. - A team consisting of one member from the department of social services and one member from the local management entity responsible for assisting in finding an appropriate placement for discharged residents, as established by the county department of social services in every county which contains an adult care home licensed under this Chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol14">
       Amenities. - Services such as meals, housekeeping, transportation, and grocery shopping that do not involve hands-on personal care.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol15">
       Assisted living residence. - Any group housing and services program for two or more unrelated adults, by whatever name it is called, that makes available, at a minimum, one meal a day and housekeeping services and provides personal care services directly or through a formal written agreement with one or more licensed home care or hospice agencies. The Department may allow nursing service exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Settings in which services are delivered may include self-contained apartment units or single or shared room units with private or area baths. Assisted living residences are to be distinguished from nursing homes subject to provisions of G.S. 131E-102. There are three types of assisted living residences: adult care homes, adult care homes that serve only elderly persons, and multiunit assisted housing with services. As used in this section, "elderly person" means:
       <ol type="a">
        <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol15a">
         Any person who has attained the age of 55 years or older and requires assistance with activities of daily living, housing, and services, or
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol15b">
         Any adult who has a primary diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or other form of dementia who requires assistance with activities of daily living, housing, and services provided by a licensed Alzheimer's and dementia care unit.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da01s131D-2.1ol16">

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - Subdivisions (16) and (17), as enacted by Session Laws 2011-272, s. 1, were redesignated as subdivisions (9a) and (3a), respectively, at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes to maintain alphabetical order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-389, s. 1, provides: "The Department of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with the Department of Correction [now the Division of Adult Correction of the Department of Public Safety], shall establish a pilot program to allow certain inmates released from confinement pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.148.html#t148a01s148-4" target="_blank">G.S. 148-4</a></cite> or Article 84B of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15A</a></cite> of the General Statutes, who have been determined by the Department of Correction to be in need of personal care services and medication management, to be placed in an adult care home licensed under Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 131D</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The purpose of the pilot program is to determine if placing this population of released inmates in an adult care home provides the State with a lower cost alternative to providing for their care upon release from confinement without jeopardizing the health and safety of the inmates or the public. The Department of Health and Human Services shall select one adult care home to participate in the pilot program. The selected adult care home is prohibited from having or admitting any residents other than the inmates selected to participate in the pilot program. The Secretary of Health and Human Services may waive any rule adopted under Article 1 or Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html" target="_blank">Chapter 131D</a></cite> of the General Statutes as necessary to protect the public health and safety."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-389, s. 2, provides: "Not later than 18 months after the participating adult care home admits its first resident in accordance with the pilot program established under Section 1 of this act, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Correction [now the Division of Adult Correction of the Department of Public Safety] shall report their findings and recommendations to the Joint Legislative Corrections, Crime Control, and Juvenile Justice Oversight Committee. The report shall include an analysis of the costs and benefits of allowing this population of released inmates to be placed in an adult care home setting as compared to continuing their incarceration in a unit of the State prison system."

The General Assembly also is committed to the development of a plan that continues to advance the State's current system into a statewide system of person-centered, affordable services and supports that emphasize an individual's dignity, choice, and independence and provides new opportunities and increased capacity for community housing and community supports.
     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      "(4) For adults with intellectual and other developmental disabilities, expansion of community-based services and supports, housing options, and supported work. Maximize the use of habilitation services that may be available via the Medicaid "I" option for individuals who do not meet the ICF-MR level of need.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Methods to responsibly manage the growth in long-term care spending, including use of Medicaid waivers.

     </p>
     <p>
      "(e) Of the amount appropriated to the Fund established in subsection (d) of this section, the sum of ten million three hundred thousand dollars ($10,300,000) is appropriated to support the Department of Health and Human Services in its plan for transitioning individuals with severe mental illness and severe and persistent mental illness into community living arrangements, including establishing a rental assistance program. If the State executes an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) in response to the USDOJ findings dated July 28, 2011, or implements a plan in response to the USDOJ findings, these funds shall be used to implement the requirements of the first year of the agreement or the plan. In the event such an agreement is reached, a recurring appropriation will be necessary to fully implement it. The Department may issue temporary rules to implement this subsection."

     <p>
      Session Laws 2012-142, s. 10.23A(f), as amended by Session Laws 2012-145, s. 3.6, provides: "Of the amount appropriated to the Fund established in subsection (d) of this section, the sum of thirty-nine million seven hundred thousand dollars ($39,700,000) is designated for implementation of the State's plan to provide temporary, short-term assistance only to adult care homes as they transition into the State's Transitions to Community Living Initiative. These funds shall be used only for this purpose. The General Assembly recognizes that while transformation of the system is being undertaken, adult care homes provide stable and safe housing and care to many of North Carolina's frail and elderly population, and it is necessary during this time of transition and transformation of the statewide system that the industry remain able to provide such care.

     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a State-County Special Assistance program that allows counties greater flexibility in serving individual needs within their communities and greater control over how county funds are used to support this program in light of the fact that counties are required to pay for fifty percent (50%) of the costs of this program. To that end, the General Assembly directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) The Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Aging and Adult Services (Department), shall establish a pilot program to implement a tiered rate structure within the State-County Special Assistance program for individuals residing in group homes, in-home living arrangements, and assisted living residences as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Da01s131D-2.1" target="_self">G.S. 131D-2.1</a></cite>. The purposes of the pilot program are to (i) determine the best way to implement a block grant for this program statewide and (ii) test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a tiered rate structure to address program participants' intensity of need, including medication management. The Department shall select a minimum of four and a maximum of six counties to participate in the pilot program, at least two of which shall be rural counties and at least two of which shall be urban counties. The pilot program shall (i) be implemented during the 2013-2014 fiscal year, (ii) operate for at least a 12-month period, and (iii) comply with any agreements in effect between the State of North Carolina and the United States government.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) The Department shall implement the pilot program in collaboration with the local departments of social services in the counties selected for participation. As part of the pilot program, the selected counties shall receive a State General Fund allocation as a block grant to be equally matched with county general funds. The General Fund allocation provided to each county participating in the pilot program shall be calculated based upon the average annual Special Assistance expenditures for that county during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, adjusted for the amount of projected annual growth in the number of Special Assistance recipients in that county during the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium. These funds may be used to pay for room, board, and personal care services, including medication management, for individuals eligible to receive State-County Special Assistance, subject to the following limitations and requirements:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) These funds shall not be used to cover any portion of the cost of providing services for which an individual receives Medicaid coverage.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The pilot program shall comply with all federal and State requirements governing the existing State-County Special Assistance program, except that Section 12D.3 does not apply to the pilot program.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The tiered rate structure shall be based upon intensity of need, and an individual's placement within a tier shall be based upon an independent assessment of the individual's need for room, board, and assistance with activities of daily living, including medication management.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e) By February 1, 2014, the Department shall submit a progress report on the implementation and operation of the pilot program, including any obstacles to implementation; and by February 1, 2015, the Department shall submit a final report on the results of the pilot program, along with any recommendations based on these results, to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and the Fiscal Research Division.

       It is the policy of this State to strengthen and preserve the family as a unit consistent with a high priority of protecting children's welfare. When a child requires care outside the family unit, it is the duty of the State to assure that the quality of substitute care is as close as possible to the care and nurturing that society expects of a family. However, the State recognizes there are instances when protecting a child's welfare outweighs reunifying the family unit, and as such, the care of residential care facilities providing high quality services that include meeting the children's educational needs as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services can satisfy the standard of protecting a child's welfare, regardless of the child's age, particularly when the sibling groups can be kept intact. To that end, the General Assembly promotes the following in the provision of foster care:
       <ol>

         The ability to communicate with the assigned social worker or case worker overseeing the child's case and have calls made to the social worker or case worker returned within a reasonable period of time.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da1As131D-10.1ol1a4">
         Allowing the child to remain enrolled in the school the child attended before being placed in foster care, if at all possible.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da1As131D-10.1ol1a5">
         Having a social worker, when a child is removed from the home, to immediately begin conducting an investigation to identify and locate all grandparents, adult siblings, and other adult relatives of the child to provide those persons with specific information and explanation of various options to participate in placement of a child.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da1As131D-10.1ol1a6">

   - Session Laws 2017-41, s. 6.1(a), (b), provides: "(a) The General Assembly recognizes that not having a drivers license is a barrier to education, employment, health care, and other community-based activities for older youth in foster care, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Da1As131D-10.2" target="_self">G.S. 131D-10.2(9)</a></cite>, working toward independence. One of the biggest barriers to accessing a drivers license for such youth is the ability to obtain insurance. Therefore, to assist in this effort, the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, shall establish a two-year pilot program that shall reimburse, on a first-come, first-served basis, youth and caregivers' costs associated with drivers license education, drivers license fees, insurance costs, and any other costs associated with obtaining a drivers license. The Division shall take appropriate steps to ensure proper advertising of the pilot program.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) The Division of Social Services shall report on the pilot project to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services by March 1, 2018."

       Pilot Waiver for IAFT Foster Parents.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2017-41, s. 7(a)-(c), provides: "(a) The General Assembly has determined that in an effort to maximize funding, local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs) are utilizing Intensive Alternative Family Treatment (IAFT), which is a means of cost-effective, specialized foster care treatment service that is being used for many youth who would have previously been treated in Medicaid congregate care, such as psychiatric residential treatment facilities. The General Assembly finds that these higher-need youth are often (i) suspended or expelled from school or day programs and (ii) require multiple appointments on a weekly basis to address needs, such as therapy, medication management, and school individual education plans (IEPs). Further, in accordance with rules, foster parents are required to maintain outside employment while providing foster care, but the constant demands of meeting the needs of these foster youth often lead to disruption in placement as the foster parent is unable to meet those needs while maintaining the parent's employment obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) To that end, the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services (Division), shall establish a pilot program that will allow the Division to waive the employment requirement for foster parents with children utilizing the Intensive Alternative Family Treatment (IAFT). The Division shall solicit participation in the pilot program from interested local management entities/managed care organizations (LME/MCOs). The participating LME/MCOs shall conduct comparison measures between existing IAFT outcomes and those of pilots to determine any impact the waiver may have on outside employment. LME/MCOs shall measure progress of the pilot waivers based on the expectation of meeting the following outcomes:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Improved placement stability with less than twenty percent (20%) of moves of youth occurring due to therapeutic foster parent request.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Seventy-five percent (75%) of youth and families meeting their treatment goals within the projected time frame.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) No more than a ten percent (10%) increase in higher-level hospital bed days.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) LME/MCOs participating in the IAFT pilot waiver program shall provide a report on the outcomes of the pilots, along with any recommendations, to the Division. The Division shall then submit a report on the pilot waiver program to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services by December 1, 2018."

     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2014-100, s. 12C.1(a)-(g) provides: "(a) Findings and Intent. - The General Assembly makes the following findings:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Child Protective Services' policy from the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, recommends that the average child protective services caseload be no greater than 10 families at any time for workers performing child protective services assessments and 10 families at any time for staff providing in-home services. However, data suggests that in 43 of the counties in this State, 21 have a caseload size of more than 15 cases per worker; and further, in nine of those 21 counties, there is an average caseload size of more than 20 cases per worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) During the 2013-2014 fiscal year, county departments of social services lost federal funding for child protective services under the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Block Grant and Title IV-E funding. However, the number of Child Protective Services investigations has grown by twenty percent (20%) from fiscal year 2002 to fiscal year 2012.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) There is no current, statewide data available on the performance of county departments of social services regarding child protective services.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) There exists the potential for a conflict of interest to arise when a county department of social services has been appointed as guardian for both (i) a child who is the subject of a report of abuse, neglect, or dependency that would be investigated by Child Protective Services and (ii) for the parent or legal guardian of the child.
     </p>
     <p>
      "It is the intent of the General Assembly to (i) reduce caseload size for Child Protective Services' workers to the recommended standard, (ii) provide adequate resources for county departments of social services to provide child protective services for abused, neglected, and dependent children, (iii) provide for a comprehensive evaluation of various functions and funding regarding child protective services, and (iv) study ways to reduce conflicts of interest regarding guardianship and child protective services. To that end, the General Assembly supports the initiatives and the allocation of funds for child welfare services as described in this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) Funds for Child Protective Services. - Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of seven million three hundred sixty-nine thousand nine hundred seventy dollars ($7,369,970) shall be allocated to county departments of social services. Four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000) of those funds shall be used to replace federal funds counties lost during the 2013-2014 fiscal year previously used to pay for child protective services' workers. Beginning October 1, 2014, the remaining two million eight hundred sixty-nine thousand nine hundred seventy dollars ($2,869,970) shall be used to provide additional funding for child protective services' workers to reduce caseloads to an average of 10 families per worker.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) Funds for In-Home Services. - Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000) shall be allocated for child welfare in-home services to provide and coordinate interventions and services that focus on child safety and protection, family preservation, and the prevention of further abuse or neglect.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) Funds for Oversight of Child Welfare Services. - Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of seven hundred fifty thousand dollars ($750,000) shall be allocated to fund nine positions to the Division to enhance oversight of child welfare services in county departments of social services. These positions shall be used to monitor, train, and provide technical assistance to the county departments of social services to ensure children and families are provided services that address the safety, permanency, and well-being of children served by child welfare services.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e) Pilot Program. - Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000) shall be used to establish and implement a child protective services pilot program. The funds shall be used to enhance coordination of services and information among county departments of social services, local law enforcement agencies, the court system, guardian ad litem programs, and other agencies as deemed appropriate by the Department. The Department shall determine the number of sites that may participate in the pilot program and include regions that are geographically diverse.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The Division shall coordinate with the Government Data Analytics Center (GDAC) in developing the pilot program and commence the pilot program by December 1, 2014.

     </p>
     <p>
      "(f) Statewide Evaluation. - Of the funds appropriated in this act to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, the sum of seven hundred thousand dollars ($700,000) shall be used to provide for a comprehensive, statewide evaluation of the State's child protective services system. The Division of Social Services shall contract for an independent evaluation of the system, which evaluation shall include developing recommendations on the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The performance of county departments of social services as related to child protective services.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Caseload sizes.

      "The Division shall report the findings and recommendations from the evaluation to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services no later than January 1, 2016.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(g) Study Conflicts of Interest/Public Guardianship and Child Protective Services. - The Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Social Services, shall study the issue of conflicts of interest in child welfare cases as related to public guardianship. In conducting the study, the Department shall consider the following regarding addressing potential conflicts of interest:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) Creating internal firewalls to prevent information sharing and influence among staff members involved with the conflicting cases.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Creating a formal or an informal "buddy system" allowing a county with a conflict to refer a case to a neighboring county.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Referring the guardianship to a corporate guardian until the child welfare case is resolved.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Having the Department assume responsibility for either the guardianship or the child welfare case.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Recommending legislation to permit the clerk the option to appoint a public agency or official, other than the Director of Social Services, to serve as a disinterested public agent in exceptional circumstances only.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Any other issues specific to this matter the Department deems appropriate.

     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) The Department shall collaborate with other affected State agencies such as the Department of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, the Department of Public Instruction, the Administrative Office of the Courts, and with local departments of social services, area mental health programs, and local education agencies to eliminate cost shifting and facilitate cost-sharing among these governmental agencies with respect to the treatment and placement services.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) The Department shall not allocate funds appropriated for Program services until a Memorandum of Agreement has been executed between the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Public Instruction, and other affected State agencies. The Memorandum of Agreement shall address specifically the roles and responsibilities of the various departmental divisions and affected State agencies involved in the administration, financing, care, and placement of children at risk of institutionalization or other out-of-home placement.

     </p>
     <p>
      MANDATORY CRIMINAL HISTORY CHECK
     </p>
     <p>
      <br />
   NORTH CAROLINA LAW REQUIRES THAT A CRIMINAL HISTORY CHECK BE CONDUCTED ON ALL PERSONS 18 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER WHO RESIDE IN A LICENSED FAMILY FOSTER HOME.
   <br />
<br />
   "Criminal history" includes any county, State, and federal conviction of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction or pending felony indictment of a crime for child abuse or neglect, spousal abuse, a crime against a child, including child pornography, or for a crime involving violence, including rape, sexual assault, or homicide, other than physical assault or battery; a county, State, or federal conviction of a felony by a court of competent jurisdiction or a pending felony indictment for physical assault, battery, or a drug related offense, if the offense was committed within the past five years; or similar crimes under federal law or under the laws of other states. Your fingerprints will be used to check the criminal history records of the State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
   <br />
<br />
   If it is determined, based on your criminal history, that you are unfit to have a foster child reside with you, you shall have the opportunity to complete or challenge the accuracy of the information contained in the SBI or FBI identification records.
   <br />
<br />
   If licensure is denied or the foster home license is revoked by the Department of Health and Human Services as a result of the criminal history check, if you are a foster parent, or are applying to become a foster parent, you may request a hearing pursuant to Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the Administrative Procedure Act.
   <br />
<br />
   Any person who intentionally falsifies any information required to be furnished to conduct the criminal history is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor."
     </p>
     <p>
      Refusal to consent to a criminal history check is grounds for the Department to deny or revoke a license to provide foster care. Any person who intentionally falsifies any information required to be furnished to conduct the criminal history is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.
     </p>
     <p>
      A foster parent who disagrees with the Department's decision may request a hearing pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the Administrative Procedure Act.

     <p>
      Meaning of "Places Children."
   
   - This section must be read in conjunction with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite> of the General Statutes which, among other things, prescribes procedures for adoptions; it is clear that placement for adoption has a much broader meaning than mere physical receipt or placement. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James B. Wood, President, Johnston Memorial Hospital, 59 N.C.A.G. 27 (1989).
     </p>
     <p>
      The words "place" or "placement," when used in the context of adoptions, refer to greater involvement in the adoption process than the physical delivery of a child to his adoptive parents. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James B. Wood, President, Johnson Memorial Hospital, 59 N.C.A.G. 27 (1989).
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       Hospital's Discharge of Infant to Adoptive Parents.
      </b>
      - Reading this section in the context of the chapter on licensing and inspection of child placing agencies leads to the conclusion that this section was not intended to address the situation in which a hospital employee, with no involvement in the arrangement of adoption, simply delivers an infant to adoptive parents. In addition, the language "in . . . adoptive homes" goes beyond what a hospital employee does when he releases a new born child to an adoptive parent; consequently, a hospital's discharge of an infant to adoptive parents does not constitute a violation of this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. James B. Wood, President, Johnston Memorial Hospital, 59 N.C.A.G. 27 (1989).

      "(b) To that end, there is created the Foster Care Transitional Living Initiative Fund that will support a demonstration project with services provided by Youth Villages to (i) improve outcomes for youth ages 17-21 years who transition from foster care through implementation of outcome-based Transitional Living Services, (ii) identify cost-savings in social services and juvenile and adult correction services associated with the provision of Transitional Living Services to youth aging out of foster care, and (iii) take necessary steps to establish an evidence-based transitional living program available to all youth aging out of foster care.

      "(1) Transitional Living Services, which is an outcome-based program that follows the Youth Villages Transitional Living Model. Outcomes on more than 7,000 participants have been tracked since the program's inception. The program has been evaluated through an independent Randomized Controlled Trial. Results indicate that Youth Villages Transitional Living Model had positive impacts in a variety of areas, including housing stability, earnings, economic hardship, mental health, and intimate partner violence in comparison to the control population.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Public-Private Partnership, which is a commitment by private-sector funding partners to match one hundred percent (100%) of the funds appropriated to the Foster Care Transitional Living Initiative Fund for the 2015-2017 fiscal biennium for the purposes of providing Transitional Living Services through the Youth Villages Transitional Living Model to youth aging out of foster care.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Impact Measurement and Evaluation, which are services funded through private partners to provide independent measurement and evaluation of the impact the Youth Villages Transitional Living Model has on the youth served, the foster care system, and on other programs and services provided by the State which are utilized by former foster care youth.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Advancement of Evidence-Based Process, which is the implementation and ongoing evaluation of the Youth Villages Transitional Living Model for the purposes of establishing the first evidence-based transitional living program in the nation. To establish the evidence-based program, additional randomized controlled trials may be conducted to advance the model."

       "Adult care home" is an assisted living residence in which the housing management provides 24-hour scheduled and unscheduled personal care services to two or more residents, either directly or, for scheduled needs, through formal written agreement with licensed home care or hospice agencies. Some licensed adult care homes provide supervision to persons with cognitive impairments whose decisions, if made independently, may jeopardize the safety or well-being of themselves or others and therefore require supervision. Medication in an adult care home may be administered by designated, trained staff. Adult care homes that provide care to two to six unrelated residents are commonly called family care homes. Adult care homes and family care homes are subject to licensure by the Division of Health Service Regulation.

       "Assisted living residence" means any group housing and services program for two or more unrelated adults, by whatever name it is called, that makes available, at a minimum, one meal a day and housekeeping services and provides personal care services directly or through a formal written agreement with one or more licensed home care or hospice agencies. The Department may allow nursing service exceptions on a case-by-case basis. Settings in which services are delivered may include self-contained apartment units or single or shared room units with private or area baths. Assisted living residences are to be distinguished from nursing homes subject to provisions of G.S. 131E-102.

       Statement of Purpose. - It is the intention of the General Assembly that community advisory committee members function as representatives of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman and through their designation work to maintain the intent of the Adult Care Home Residents' Bill of Rights within the licensed adult care homes in this State. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that the committees promote community involvement and cooperation with adult care homes to ensure quality care for the elderly and adults with disabilities.

      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1b">
       Establishment and Appointment of Committees. -
       <ol>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1b1">
         A community advisory committee shall be established in each county that has at least one licensed adult care home, shall serve all the homes in the county, and shall work with each of these homes for the best interests of the residents. In a county that has one, two, or three adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall have five members.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1b2">
         In a county with four or more adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall have one additional member for each adult care home with 10 or more beds in excess of three, and may have up to five additional members at the discretion of the county commissioners, not to exceed a maximum of 25 members. In each county with four or more adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall establish a subcommittee of no more than five members and no fewer than three members from the committee for each adult care home in the county. Each member must serve on at least one subcommittee.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1b3">
         In counties with no adult care homes with 10 or more beds, the committee shall have five members. Regardless of how many members a particular community advisory committee is required to have, at least one member of each committee shall be a person involved in the area of intellectual or other developmental disabilities.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1b4">
         The boards of county commissioners are encouraged to appoint the adult care home community advisory committees. Of the members, a minority (not less than one-third, but as close to one-third as possible) shall be chosen from among persons nominated by a majority of the chief administrators of adult care homes in the county. If the adult care home administrators fail to make a nomination within 45 days after written notification has been sent to them requesting a nomination, these appointments may be made without nominations. If the county commissioners fail to appoint members to a committee, the appointments shall be made by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman no sooner than 45 days after nominations have been requested from the adult care home administrators. In making appointments, the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman shall follow the same appointment process as that specified for the county commissioners.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1b5">
         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article, appointment to an adult care home community advisory committee is contingent upon designation of the appointee by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman in accordance with G.S. 143B-181.18. A designated appointee is directly accountable to the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program in order to perform the duties as a representative of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. Removal of the appointee's designation by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman automatically rescinds the appointment to the adult care home community advisory committee.
        </li>
        <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1b6">
         Any individual who serves as a community advisory committee member must go through the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman's certification and designation process and meet the certification and designation requirements in accordance with the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program Policies and Procedures.

       Joint Nursing and Adult Care Home Community Advisory Committees. - Appointment to the nursing home community advisory committees shall preclude appointment to the adult care home community advisory committees except where written approval to combine these committees is obtained from the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman. Where this approval is obtained, the joint nursing and adult care home community advisory committee shall have the membership required of nursing home community advisory committees and one additional member for each adult care home with 10 or more beds licensed in the county. In counties with no adult care homes with 10 or more beds, there shall be one additional member for every four other types of adult care homes in the county. In no case shall the number of members on the joint nursing and adult care home community advisory committee exceed 25. Each member shall exercise the statutory rights and responsibilities of both nursing home community advisory committees and adult care home community advisory committees. In making appointments to this joint committee, the county commissioners shall solicit nominations from both nursing and adult care home administrators for the appointment of approximately (but no more than) one-third of the members.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1d">
       Terms of Office. - Each committee member shall serve an initial term of one year. Any person reappointed to a second or subsequent term in the same county shall serve a two-or three-year term at the county commissioners' discretion to ensure staggered terms of office.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1e">
       Vacancies. - Any vacancy shall be filled by appointment of a person for a one-year term. If this vacancy is in a position filled by an appointee nominated by the chief administrators of adult care homes within the county, then the county commissioners shall fill the vacancy from persons nominated by a majority of the chief administrators. If the adult care home administrators fail to make a nomination by registered mail within 45 days after written notification has been sent to them requesting a nomination, this appointment may be made without nominations. If the county commissioners fail to fill a vacancy, the vacancy shall be filled by the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman no sooner than 45 days after the commissioners have been notified of the appointment or vacancy.

      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1g">
       Minimum Qualifications for Appointment. - Each member must be a resident of the county which the committee serves. No person or immediate family member of a person with a financial interest in a home served by the committee, or employee or governing board member of a home served by the committee, or immediate family member of a resident in a home served by the committee may be a member of that committee. Any county commissioner who is appointed to the committee serves on the committee in an ex officio capacity. Members of the committee shall serve without compensation, but may be reimbursed for actual expenses incurred by them in the performance of their duties. The names of the committee members and the date of expiration of their terms shall be filed with the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1h">
       Training, Certification, and Designation. - The Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman shall develop training requirements for certification and designation in accordance with 45 C.F.R. § 1324.13(c)(2). Each committee member must receive certification training as specified by the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program Policies and Procedures and be designated as representatives of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program prior to exercising any power under G.S. 131D-32. The State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program shall provide the committees with information, guidelines, training, and consultation to direct them in the performance of their duties.
      </li>
      <li id="t131Da03s131D-31ol1i">
       Privilege. - Any written communication made by a member of an adult care home advisory committee within the course and scope of the member's duties, as specified in G.S. 131D-32, is privileged to the extent provided in this subsection. All communication is the property of the Office of the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman and is subject to the Office's disclosure policies. This privilege is a defense in a cause of action for libel if the member was acting in good faith and the statements and communications do not amount to intentional wrongdoing.

      To the extent that any adult care home advisory committee or any member is covered by liability insurance, that committee or member shall be deemed to have waived the qualified immunity provided in this subsection to the extent of indemnification by insurance.

The verification from the physician shall include the name of the controlled substance, the prescribed dosage and frequency, and the condition for which the substance is prescribed. If the result of an applicant's or employee's examination and screening indicates the presence of a controlled substance, the adult care home may require a second examination and screening to verify the results of the prior examination and screening.
