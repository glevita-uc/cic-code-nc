    Constitutionality.
   
   - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 74A</a></cite> was unconstitutional as applied to the delegation of police powers to Campbell University.

    Record revealed sufficient evidence to support the superior court's determination that a university was a religious institution; as such, the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t74Es74E-1" target="_self">G.S. 74E-1</a></cite> et seq., as applied, were unconstitutional.

    Applicability
   
   - Dismissal of the suit under the North Carolina Public Records Act, N.C. Gen. Stat. ch. 132, was proper, because the university campus police department was not subject to the Act, when campus police departments were not enumerated in the list of departments and agencies qualifying as a public law enforcement agency, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074G.html#t74Gs74G-5ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 74G-5(a)</a></cite> did not specifically charge the Attorney General with the custodianship of arrest or incident reports of campus police departments; there was no evidence of record or argument by the parties that the board of trustees for the university elected to continue its officers' certification pursuant to the Company Police Act.

     The purpose of this Chapter is to ensure a minimum level of integrity, proficiency, and competence among company police agencies and company police officers. To achieve this purpose, the General Assembly finds that a Company Police Program needs to be established. As part of the Company Police Program, the Attorney General is given the authority to certify an agency as a company police agency and to commission an individual as a company police officer.

    <li id="t74Es74E-2ol1b">
     A hospital, a State institution, or a corporation engaged in providing on-site police security personnel services for persons or property may apply to the Attorney General to be certified as a company police agency.

The policy or certificate of self-insurance must provide not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000) of coverage per incident for personal injury or property damage resulting from a negligent act of the applicant or an agent or employee of the applicant operating in the course and scope of employment or under color of law.

    A railroad policeman appointed pursuant to former G.S. 60-83 was prima facie a public officer,
   
   but the question of whether a particular act was done as an employee of the railroad company or as a public officer was a question to be determined from the nature of the act, whether it related to vindication and enforcement of public justice or whether it was in the scope of duties owed to the company by reason of employment.

     As-Needed Assistance. - All company police may provide temporary assistance to a law enforcement agency at the request of the head of that agency, or the head of that agency's designee, such as the sheriff or chief of police, regardless of whether there is an agreement in place under subsection (h) of this section.

   <p>
    <b>
     Jurisdiction of Company Police Officers Limited to Real Property of Employer.
    </b>
    - Company police officers are limited to exercising law enforcement authority only on the real property of their employer; unless the company police officers are in continuous and immediate pursuit of a person for an offense committed upon this real property, the officers lack the territorial jurisdiction to take law enforcement actions on the streets and highways in and around this real property; thus, assuming an agreement between North Carolina Special Police (NCSP) and a town was lawful, the NCSP officers lacked law enforcement authority on the streets and private businesses in the town. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. G. Dewey Hudson, District Attorney, Fourth Prosecutorial District, 2001 N.C. AG LEXIS 4 (2/23/2001).
   </p>
   <p>
    Jurisdiction of Company or Special Police to Make Arrests Off Campus Grounds.
   
   - Special policemen appointed pursuant to former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 74A</a></cite> have territorial limits placed upon their power to arrest as set forth in this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. William S. Mason, Jr., Business Manager, Pembroke State University, 40 N.C.A.G. 164 (1970), issued under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 74A</a></cite>.
