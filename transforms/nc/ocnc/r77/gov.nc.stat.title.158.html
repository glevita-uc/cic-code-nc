                        on the wages to be paid by the initial users of a new manufacturing facility to its employees and any provisions necessary to implement the wage requirement. The issuing unit's governing body shall not adopt a plan until the Secretary
                        of Commerce certifies that the Secretary has reviewed the average weekly manufacturing wage required by the plan to be paid to the employees of a new manufacturing facility and has found either (i) that the wages proposed by the
                        initial users of a new manufacturing facility are in compliance with the amount required by this subsection or (ii) that the plan is exempt from the requirement of this subsection. The Secretary of Commerce may exempt a plan from
                        the requirement of this subsection if the Secretary receives a resolution from the issuing unit's governing body requesting an exemption from the wage requirement and a letter from an appropriate State official, selected by the

                        production of tangible personal property, including the processing resulting in a change in the condition of the property.

                        during this time defendant made full payments of its proportionate share of plaintiff's budget as set forth in plaintiff's bylaws, and where, most significantly, defendant indicated in a letter of March 8, 1982, that the county
                        board of commissioners unanimously voted to comply with the obligations incumbent on a withdrawing member, and furthermore, where defendant did not raise any material question of fact pertaining to plaintiff's request that defendant

                    If the majority of the qualified voters voting in such election favor the levying of such a tax, then and in that event, the county commissioners may create a commission to be known as the "Industrial Development Commission" for said county. Such commission
                    shall be composed of nine members. The terms of office of the members of the commission shall be three years, with the exception of the first two years' existence of the commission, in which three shall be appointed to serve for a
                    period of one year, three for a period of two years, and three for a period of three years; thereafter, all members shall be appointed for three years, and shall serve until their successors have been appointed and qualified. All appointments
                    for unexpired terms resulting from resignation, death or other causes, shall be made by the county board of commissioners. The commission shall hold its first meeting within 30 days after its appointment as provided for in this Article,
                    and the beginning date of all terms of office of the commissioners shall be the date on which the commission holds its first meeting. After the members of the commission shall have been appointed and at the time of the holding of the
                    first meeting, they shall, by a majority vote, name and select from their membership their own chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and treasurer, and shall draw up and ratify their own bylaws and procedural rules and policies. The commission
                    member who shall be named treasurer shall have supervision of all funds administered by the commission in any way whatsoever; shall sign and countersign all checks, drafts, bills of exchange, or any and all other negotiable instruments
                    which shall properly be issued under his supervision; and shall furnish such surety bond as shall be designated by the board of county commissioners. No money, property or funds of the commission herein created shall be used directly
                    or indirectly as a subsidy or investment in capital assets in any business, industry or business venture.

                    Session Laws 2013-360, s. 15.28(b), provides: "Upon the dissolution of North Carolina's Eastern Region, the North Carolina's Eastern Region Development Commission, the governing body of North Carolina's Eastern Region, shall liquidate the assets of the
                    Region to the extent possible and distribute all Region assets to the counties of the Region in proportion to the amount of the vehicle registration tax levied by the Commission and collected in each county. The assets of the Region
                    that exceed the amount of the vehicle registration tax collected by the counties and are attributable to an appropriation made to the Region by the General Assembly shall revert to the General Fund and may not be distributed to the
                    counties. A county may use funds distributed to it pursuant to this subsection only for economic development projects and infrastructure construction projects. In calculating the amount to be refunded to each county, the Region shall
                    first allocate amounts loaned and not yet repaid as follows:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Amounts loaned for a project in a county will be allocated to that county to the extent of its beneficial ownership of the principal of the interest-bearing trust account in which the proceeds of the vehicle registration tax levied by the Commission
                    were placed, and the county will become the owner of the right to repayment of the amount loaned to the extent of its beneficial ownership of the principal of the trust account.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Amounts not allocated pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be allocated among the remaining counties in proportion to the amount of the vehicle registration tax collected in each county, and the remaining counties shall become the
                    owners of the right to repayment of the amounts loaned in proportion to the amount of the vehicle registration tax collected in each county.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Notes and other instruments representing the right to repayment shall, upon dissolution of the Region, be held and collected by the State Treasurer, who shall disburse the collections to the counties as provided in this subsection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "The Commission shall distribute those assets that it is unable to liquidate among the Region counties insofar as practical on an equitable basis, as determined by the Commission. Upon dissolution, the State of North Carolina shall succeed to any remaining
                    rights, obligations, and liabilities of the Region not assigned to the Region counties."
