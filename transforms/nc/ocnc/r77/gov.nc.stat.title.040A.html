       Notwithstanding the provisions of any local act, it is the intent of the General Assembly that, effective August 15, 2006, the uses set out in G.S. 40A-3 are the exclusive uses for which the authority to exercise the power of eminent domain is granted to private condemnors, local public condemnors, and other public condemnors. Effective August 15, 2006, a local act granting the authority to exercise the power of eminent domain to a private condemnor, local public condemnor, or other public condemnor for a use or purpose other than those granted to it in G.S. 40A-3(a), (b), (b1), or (c) is not effective for that use or purpose. Provided that, any eminent domain action commenced before August 15, 2006, for a use or purpose granted in a local act, may be lawfully completed pursuant to the provisions of that local act. The provisions of this subsection shall not repeal any provision of a local act limiting the purposes for which the authority to exercise the power of eminent domain may be used.

      </p>
      <p>
       Power of Eminent Domain Is Attribute of Sovereignty.
   
   - The power of eminent domain is one of the attributes of a sovereign state. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Eminent Domain Exists Independently of Constitutional Provisions.
   
   - The right to take private property for public use exists independently of constitutional provisions. In fact, such provisions are limitations on the State's power to exercise the right. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Eminent Domain Is Exclusively in Control of Legislature.
   
   - The method of taking land for a public use is within the exclusive control of the legislature, limited by organic law, and the courts cannot help the injured landowner, where the statute has been strictly followed, until the question of compensation is reached. Durham v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 128</cite>, 53 S.E. 531 (1906).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of eminent domain is possessed by the government,
   
   and may be exercised by the legislature or under its authority. It is peculiarly fit to be wielded by the legislature, as it is a power founded on necessity. Raleigh &amp; G.R.R. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 451</cite> (1837).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless Properly Delegated.
   
   - The right to exercise the power of eminent domain belongs to every independent government exercising sovereign power, as a necessary incident to its sovereignty, and this power, unless otherwise provided in the organic law, rests solely in the State unless by legislative action the power is delegated, the purposes for which it may be exercised enumerated, and the procedure for such exercise prescribed. Mount Olive v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 259</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 525 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason for Eminent Domain.
   
   - The right of eminent domain is granted because the public interest requires that private property shall be taken for public use under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by law. Raleigh, C. &amp; S.R.R. v. Mecklenburg Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 168</cite>, 82 S.E. 5 (1914).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Public necessity alone justifies governmental taking of private property.
   
   State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The power of eminent domain cannot be implied
   
   or inferred from vague or doubtful language. Commissioners of Beaufort County v. Bonner, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 66</cite>, 68 S.E. 970 (1910).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the statute is silent on the subject it is to be presumed that the legislature intended that the necessary property should be obtained by contract. Commissioners of Beaufort County v. Bonner, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 66</cite>, 68 S.E. 970 (1910).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes Giving Power Must Be Strictly Construed.
   
   - Statutes which authorize the exercise of the power of eminent domain must be strictly construed. Durham &amp; N.R.R. v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 16</cite>, 10 S.E. 1041 (1890); Caroline &amp; N.W.R.R. v. Pennearden Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 644</cite>, 44 S.E. 358 (1903); Board of Educ. v. Forrest, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 519</cite>, 137 S.E. 431 (1927).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Strict Construction of Authority to Condemn Land for Schools.
   
   - The statutory authority given the county board of education to condemn land for school purposes will be strictly construed as to the extent or limit of the power given. Board of Educ. v. Forrest, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 519</cite>, 137 S.E. 431 (1927).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter Is Applicable to Private Landowners.
   
   - Even though private landowners are not specifically mentioned in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa01s40A-3" target="_self">G.S. 40A-3</a></cite>, they are bound by the provisions of this Chapter. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of eminent domain can be exercised only in the mode pointed out in the statute
   
   conferring it. Allen v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 381</cite>, 9 S.E. 4 (1889).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability of Rules of Civil Procedure to Private Condemnation Proceedings.
   
   - Section 40A-12, together with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sXIIa33s1-393" target="_blank">G.S. 1-393</a></cite>, gives trial courts clear authority to apply the Rules of Civil Procedure in private condemnation proceedings, at least to the extent that those rules do not directly conflict with procedures specifically mandated by this Chapter. VEPCO v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 73</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 62 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability of Rule 60, Rules of Civil Procedure.
   
   - Rule 60, of the Rules of Civil Procedure, applies to proceedings under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.040A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 40A</a></cite> in order to provide relief from judgments or orders when necessary to promote the interests of justice. City of Durham v. Woo, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 497 S.E.2d 457, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 496</cite>, 518 S.E.2d 380 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversion of Private Condemnation Proceedings into Quiet Title Action.
   
   - Trial court did not err by applying <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 15(b) in such a way as to convert condemnation proceedings brought by private condemnors, with the consent of the parties, into an action to quiet title. VEPCO v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 73</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 62 (1986).

       Meaning of "Eminent Domain".
   
   - The words "eminent domain" mean the power of the sovereign or some agency authorized by it to take private property for public use. VEPCO v. King, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 219</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 318 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Eminent Domain Not Intended Absent Provision for Compensation.
   
   - Where a statute makes no provision for compensation, it is to be presumed that the legislature did not intend that the power of eminent domain should be exercised. Commissioners of Beaufort County v. Bonner, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 66</cite>, 68 S.E. 970 (1910).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Impairment of Property Rights Unconstitutional Unless Compensation Provided.
   
   - A statutory amendment to a former statute which destroyed and sensibly impaired vested property rights acquired under the former statute or which attempted to transfer them either to the public or any other, except under the principles of eminent domain and upon compensation duly made, was unconstitutional and invalid. Watts v. Lenoir &amp; Blowing Rock Turnpike Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 129</cite>, 106 S.E. 497 (1921).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Definition of "property" is broad enough to include profits a prendre,
   
   requiring just compensation to the owner of that interest when the right to enter upon lands is lost through condemnation. In re Lee, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 354 S.E.2d 759, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 513</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 520 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Inclusion of Equipment Within Definition of Property
   
   - It was not error for trial court to allow testimony about the value of the property to be taken which included various equipment present on the property, as the authority proposing to take the property never specifically excluded this equipment from its taking, and it could be included within the definition of property in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa01s40A-2" target="_self">G.S. 40A-2(7)</a></cite>. Piedmont Triad Reg'l Water Auth. v. Lamb, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 564 S.E.2d 71, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 166</cite>, 568 S.E.2d 608 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Diversion of Water as a "Taking".
   
   - Diversion of the natural flow and drainage of streams and surface waters incident to the construction of a highway, resulting in the periodic flooding of the lands of a proprietor, is a "taking" of property for which just compensation must be paid. Braswell v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 508</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 912 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly applied the common law doctrine of riparian rights to determine that a public water authority had taken property owners' riparian rights and that the owners were entitled to compensation for the taking because the owners were able to present evidence at trial that the authority's diversion of water had reduced and would continue to reduce the natural rate of flow in a river, and nothing in the impoundment statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html#t143a21s143-215.44" target="_blank">G.S. 143-215.44</a></cite> to 143-215.50, or a North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) certificate stated that the authority was not obligated to pay just compensation; the impoundment statutes and the EMC certificate authorized the authority to exercise its power of eminent domain by diverting the water flow in the river in order to develop a public water supply, but just because the authority was authorized to exercise its powers of eminent domain, it did not follow that the authority was relieved of the constitutional mandate to compensate those whose property was taken. L&amp;S Water Power, Inc. v. Piedmont Triad Reg'l Water Auth., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 712 S.E.2d 146 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "other persons" as used in the cartway statute, does include counties.
   
   Davis v. Forsyth County, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 725, 453 S.E.2d 231 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Month-to-Month Tenant as Owner.
   
   - A tenant having month-to-month tenancy based upon periodic rental payments without a written document is considered to be an "owner" as defined by this section, and has standing to challenge a condemnation proceeding itself as arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Calco Enters., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 511 S.E.2d 671 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Digging a ditch across private land to drain a public road amounts to a taking
   
   of private property for a public use. State v. New, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 731</cite>, 41 S.E. 1033 (1902).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute giving power to overseers of roads to cut poles on adjacent land
   
   was an instance of the exercise on the part of the sovereign of the right to take private property for the use of the public upon making compensation. Collins v. Creecy, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. 333</cite> (1861).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a landowner has granted a right-of-way over his land, he must look to his contract for compensation,
   
   as it cannot be awarded to him in condemnation proceedings, provided the contract is valid, and all its conditions have been complied with by the grantee. Feldman v. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 162, 175 S.E.2d 713 (1970).

        Chapter Is Applicable to Private Landowners.
   
   - Even though private landowners are not specifically mentioned in this section, they are bound by the provisions of this Chapter. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).

        Although a condemning entity must establish that a proposed taking will further a public purpose before a condemnation can be authorized, there is no reason why a reciprocal burden to establish the existence of a public purpose should be imposed upon a property owner who has been deprived of his or her property by governmental action taken for a non-public purpose.

        Taking of Private Property Must Be for Public Use.
   
   - In the exercise of the sovereign power of eminent domain, private property can be taken only for a public use and upon the payment of just compensation. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126 (1965).

        Meaning of "Public Use".
   
   - "Public use," as applied in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, is not capable of a precise definition applicable to all situations. The term is elastic, and keeps pace with changing conditions, since the progressive demands of society and changing concepts of governmental duties and functions are constantly bringing new subjects forward as being for "public use." State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory phrase "the public use or benefit" is incapable of a precise definition applicable to all situations. Rather, because of the progressive demands of an ever-changing society and the perpetually fluid concept of governmental duty and function, the phrase is elastic and keeps pace with the changing times. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 426</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 399 (1988).

        Test of Public Use or Benefit.
   
   - On judicial determination of whether a condemnor's intended use is an action for "the public use or benefit" under this section, courts in this and other states have employed essentially two approaches to this problem. The first approach - the public use test - asks whether the public has a right to a definite use of the condemned property. The second approach - the public benefit test - asks whether some benefit accrues to the public as a result of the desired condemnation. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 426</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 399 (1988).

        Question of Law.
   
   - While the delegation of the power of eminent domain is for the legislature, the determination of whether a condemnor's intended use of the land is for "the public use or benefit" is a question of law for the courts. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 426</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 399 (1988).

       </p>
       <p>
        A taking can be for public use or benefit even when there is also a substantial private use,
   
   so long as the private use in question is incidental to the paramount public use. Carolina Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. McLeod, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 426</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 399 (1988).

        City Authorized to Expand Sewer
   
   - In a declaratory judgment action challenging a city's condemnation proceeding for expansion of the city's sewer system, a judgment for the city was proper because the intended use of the condemnation satisfied the public use and public benefit test as all city residents, including the landowners whose property was being condemned, would have the equal right to connect to the expanded sewer system, which was an essential service. Tucker v. City of Kannapolis, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 174, 582 S.E.2d 697 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Expansion of sewer service constituted an action for the public use, and a city validly exercised its power of eminent domain to condemn a sewer easement over land because the easement area would be available to the public at large; using the eminent domain power to connect the city's property to the sewer pump station under the owner's property benefited the public because there was no sewer access on the city's property, and extending the sewer lines would allow the development of the land. City of Asheville v. Resurgence Dev. Co., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 748 S.E.2d 751 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        City validly exercised its power of eminent domain to condemn a sewer easement over an owner's land because the
   development of affordable housing for the area was the predominant interest at stake. City of Asheville v. Resurgence Dev. Co., LLC, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 748 S.E.2d 751 (2013).

       <p>
        Term "public purposes" is employed in the same sense in the law of taxation and of eminent domain.
   
   Thus, if the General Assembly may authorize a State agency to expend public money for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a hospital facility to the leased to and ultimately conveyed to a private agency, it may also authorize the acquisition of a site for such facility by exercise of the power of eminent domain.

       <p>
        The use which will justify the taking of private property
   
   under the exercise of the right of eminent domain is the use by or for the government, the general public, or some portion thereof as such, and not the use by or for particular individuals or for the benefit of particular estates. The use may be limited to the inhabitants of a small locality, but the benefit must be in common. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126 (1965).

       <p>
        Scenic Value of Road May Be Considered.
   
   - The scenic value of a road and its necessity as a part of the system of scenic highways for the public may be considered in determining whether taking over the road is for a public or private purpose. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126 (1965).

        Use of the words "commercial railway" in a petition

        Condemnation Not Prohibited.
   
   - Summary judgment was properly entered in a declaratory action regarding the applicability of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html#t153Aa02s153A-15ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 153A-15(b)</a></cite> because a condemnation action by a city in order to facilitate the construction of a water supply and distribution facility did not require any approval since the city and the land were located in the same county; moreover, the evidence showed that the real and substantial benefits of the condemnation accrued to the city in question, and not other parties in the case that were located in different counties. Caswell County v. Town of Yanceyville, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 611 S.E.2d 451 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Condemnation Action Served No Public Benefit.
   
   - Town's condemnation action was properly dismissed because property owners showed the action served no public benefit, as (1) the action would not "open" a street, since the street had not been closed, as access to the street was never blocked, and other portions of the street were not public, especially when the property was at the end of a dead-end street, (2) condemnation would not provide neighbors' access to land, utility service provider access, fire fighters' access to water, or general community interconnectedness, and (3) the evidence showed the town was motivated by considerations irrelevant to the public benefit.

        Right to Exercise Eminent Domain - Railroads.
   
   - Railroads are quasi-public corporations, created to serve primarily the public good and convenience, and as such they exercise public franchise rights, including that of eminent domain. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 495</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 771 (1954).

       <p>
        Right to Exercise Eminent Domain - Public Service Corporations Generally.
   
   - A public service corporation has no power to condemn land by reason of its being a riparian proprietor, but only under authority given to it by a valid statute to do so. Carolina-Tennessee Power Co. v. Hiawassee River Power Co., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 668</cite>, 96 S.E. 99 (1918), appeal dismissed, 252 U.S. 341, 40 S. Ct. 330, 64 L. Ed. 601 (1920).

       <p>
        Right to Exercise Eminent Domain - Public Service Corporations Generating Electricity.
   
   - A corporation furnishing electricity for public use may condemn lands of a private owner necessary for its transmission lines, but it is unlawful for a power company to enter upon and take the lands of the owner for such purpose without complying with the statutory procedure. Crisp v. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 46</cite>, 158 S.E. 845 (1931).

        Where a corporation is authorized by its charter to generate and sell electricity and to build dams and hydroelectric plants necessary to the generation of such hydroelectric power, and is therein given power of eminent domain to acquire the necessary rights-of-way and lands for its dams and the ponding of water, such corporation is a public service corporation and has the power of eminent domain, and it cannot be successfully contended that its taking of lands for ponding water necessary for one of its dams is a taking of private lands for a private use, nor does the fact that such public service corporation also engages in private enterprises not connected with its public service alter this result. Whiting Mfg. Co. v. Carolina Aluminum Co., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 52</cite>, 175 S.E. 698 (1934).

       <p>
        Condemnation Rights Not Impaired by Charter Rights of Private Nature.
   
   - The right of a corporation to condemn lands for a public use is not affected or impaired because in its charter it may be given rights of a more private nature to which the right of condemnation may not attach. Mountain Retreat Ass'n v. Mount Mitchell Dev. Co., <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 43</cite>, 110 S.E. 524 (1922).

        Where the Utilities Commission, acting under former G.S. 40-4, selected a site after due inquiry, the railroads would not be enjoined, at the instance of citizens and property owners, from erecting the depot, either on the ground that the city was being sidetracked or that property would be damaged by the proposed change.

        The grant of a right-of-way of a specified width does not preclude the grantor from such use of his land himself or by others with his permission which is not in conflict therewith. Goldsboro Lumber Co. v. Hines Bros. Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 254</cite>, 35 S.E. 458 (1900).

       <p>
        Cultivation of Land by Owner.
   
   - While land included in the right-of-way of a railroad company, not necessary for the purposes of the company, may be cultivated by the servient owner, the crop must not be of such inflammable or combustible nature, when matured or maturing, as to endanger the safety of the company's passengers or cause injury to adjoining lands in case of ignition of such crops by sparks from the company's engines; in such a case, the company would have the right to enter and remove such crops. Raleigh &amp; Augusta Air Line R.R. v. Sturgeon, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 225</cite>, 26 S.E. 779 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless the land is needed for some use, the occupation and cultivation by the owner of the servient tenement will be disturbed only when it becomes necessary for the company to enter in order to remove something which endangers the safety of its passengers, or which might, if undisturbed, subject the owner to liability for injury to adjacent lands or property. Ward v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 358</cite>, 13 S.E. 926 (1891); Ward v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 566</cite>, 18 S.E. 211 (1893); Blue v. Aberdeen &amp; W.E.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 644</cite>, 23 S.E. 275 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of Company to Clear Right-of-Way.
   
   - A railroad company is not negligent in failing to cut down bushes or weeds on the right-of-way beyond the portion over which it is exercising actual control for corporate purposes, but is required to keep the right-of-way clear of such growth to the outside of the side ditches on either side of the track. Ward v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 358</cite>, 13 S.E. 926 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a railroad company permitted dry grass or leaves or other combustible rubbish to remain near its track and the same took fire from sparks emitted from one of its locomotives which had no spark arrester, and the fire was thereby communicated to the plaintiff's adjoining land, destroying timber, etc., it was held that the injury resulted from the negligence of the defendant company. Aycock v. Raleigh &amp; Augusta Air Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 321</cite> (1883).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only Easement Rights Held Acquired.
   
   - Only an easement in lands passes from the owner to a railroad company under condemnation proceedings divesting all the rights of owners who are parties to the proceedings in such easement during the corporate existence of the company, but allowing them to use and occupy the right-of-way in any manner not inconsistent with the easement acquired.

        Public Recreational Facility Need Not Be Designed Before Land Is Acquired.
   
   - Neither subdivision (b)(3) of this section, which vests municipalities with the power of eminent domain to establish, enlarge or improve parks, playgrounds and other recreational facilities, nor <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa18s160A-353" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-353</a></cite>, of similar import, nor any other statute contains any requirement that the city design a public facility authorized by resolution before the land for the facility is acquired. City of Charlotte v. Rousso, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 588, 346 S.E.2d 693 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Local Zoning Laws.
   
   - While municipalities or counties may exercise the power of eminent domain for the construction, enlarging or improving of those buildings listed in subdivision (b)(6), the power of eminent domain does not include locating a particular building in violation of another jurisdiction's zoning laws, by virtue of the fact that through G.S. 153A-347 and 160A-392 the Legislature has made zoning regulations with regard to buildings specifically applicable to political subdivisions. The same zoning restrictions do not apply, however, to the construction, establishment, enlargement, improvement, maintenance, ownership or operation of a public enterprise unless the Legislature has clearly manifested a contrary intent. Davidson County v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 354 S.E.2d 280, modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 252</cite>, 362 S.E.2d 553 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A municipal corporation can only exercise the right of eminent domain when authorized
   
   to do so by its charter or by general law, being a creature of the Legislature. Mount Olive v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 259</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 525 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Condemnation by Municipalities for Operation of Water and Sewer Systems.
   
   - The right of eminent domain has been conferred upon municipalities operating water and sewer systems. If such corporation is unable to agree with a landowner for the purchase of land it needs for such purpose, it may acquire the land, or an easement therein, by following the procedure set forth. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).

       </p>
       <p>
        Exercise of Discretion in Widening Streets of Town.
   
   - Where it appeared that the governing authorities of a town took lands to widen a street intersecting with other streets so as to lessen the danger to traffic thereon, and that doing so was a reasonable exercise of discretion, finding that such course was unnecessary was not binding on the Supreme Court, the question being, primarily, whether the administrative authorities of the town so grossly and manifestly abused the exercise of their discretionary powers as to render their action ineffectual. Lee v. Town of Waynesville, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 565</cite>, 115 S.E. 51 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Acquisition of Storm Sewer Easement by Payment of Permanent Damages.
   
   - Where plaintiff landowners demanded permanent damages in their action against a municipality for trespass based upon the construction by the municipality of a storm sewer line over their lands, and defendant municipality prayed for an easement for the purpose of maintaining such drainage system, under the verdict and judgment awarding permanent damages the municipality, upon payment of the damages awarded, acquired a permanent easement to maintain its storm sewer line so long as it was kept in proper repair. McLean v. Town of Mooresville, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 498</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 327 (1953).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Improvements Held No Bar to Condemnation.
   
   - The governing authorities of a town are not estopped to condemn land for the widening or improvement of its streets by reason of an owner having put extensive improvements on his land a long time prior to the time it was condemned for that purpose, the power of condemnation, in cases of such character, being a continuing one to be exercised when and to the extent that the public good may require it. Lee v. Town of Waynesville, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 565</cite>, 115 S.E. 51 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Condemnation proceedings for a school site
   
   must be considered as instituted under former G.S. 40-2 (similar to this section) pursuant to authority conferred by former G.S. 115-125 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsIXa37s115C-517" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-517</a></cite>).

        It was not error to find that plaintiff was authorized to acquire land for parks, recreational programs and facilities
   
   through exercise of power of eminent domain. Town of Chapel Hill v. Burchette, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 157, 394 S.E.2d 698 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Trust Rights.
   
   - It was error to grant a town judgment notwithstanding a verdict in a condemnation case on a theory that the public trust doctrine made the taking noncompensable because (1) the theory was not raised on directed verdict, (2) the sua sponte order was entered months after final judgment, and (3) the town was estopped from asserting the town possessed rights taken as the town's complaint said the town did not, the town did not raise the issue at an "all other issues" hearing, at which the town disavowed the public trust doctrine, the town did not immediately appeal a vital ruling that the town condemned the property, and landowners introduced a scintilla of supporting evidence. Town of Nags Head v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 817 S.E.2d 874 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 349</cite>, 828 S.E.2d 154, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 523 (2019).

        To Whom Limitation Applicable.
   
   - Limitation in former G.S. 40-10 as to condemnation of the owner's dwelling, burial grounds, etc., was only upon such corporations as were defined and named in the former article, when exercising the power of eminent domain granted in such article in connection with the construction of the works or projects enumerated therein, and pursuant to the authority granted thereby. Mount Olive v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 259</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 525 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing Project Not Covered.
   
   - Prohibition against condemnation of burial grounds, dwelling houses, etc., without the consent of the owner is not applicable to proceeding to condemn lands for housing project. In re Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 649</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 761 (1951).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Was Former Park Commission.
   
   - Former North Carolina National Park Commission created by Public Acts 1927, c. 48, was an agency of the State created by statute, vested with the power of eminent domain, and was not subject to the limitations provided for corporations by former G.S. 40-8 and G.S. 40-11. Yarbrough v. North Carolina Park Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 284</cite>, 145 S.E. 563 (1928).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Municipality to Acquire Dwellings by Condemnation.
   
   - The governing body of a municipality, for the purpose of erecting an elevated water storage tank as an addition to its water system, has the power, in the exercise of a sound discretion, to acquire dwelling-house properties either within or outside the city by condemnation. City of Raleigh v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 671</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 396 (1952), commented on in, 31 N.C.L. Rev. 125 (1952). See also Mount Olive v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 259</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 525 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent Charter Restrictions to the Contrary.
   
   - Where a city, under its charter, is given the same power to condemn lands of private owners for municipal purposes that is given to railroads and other public utilities, it is bound by the restrictions placed on them by this section. Selma v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 322</cite>, 111 S.E. 543 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not apply to tenant houses,
   
   but only to the dwellings of the owner of the lands, which are preserved to him for sentimental reasons, and which could not exist where such owner is a corporation renting dwellings to its tenants. Raleigh, C. &amp; S.R.R. v. Mecklenburg Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 168</cite>, 82 S.E. 5 (1914).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use by Owner Subsequent to Acquisition of Right-of-Way Not Protected.
   
   - When a provision in a charter of a railroad company or a deed granting it a right-of-way prohibited it from entering upon the yard, garden, burial ground, etc., of the defendants, but no portion of the right-of-way was so used at the date of its acquisition, the right of the company would not be interfered with by the fact that it has since been appropriated to such use. Dargan v. Carolina Cent. R.R., <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 623</cite>, 42 S.E. 979 (1902); Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Olive, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 257</cite>, 55 S.E. 263 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Maintenance of Nuisance as Violation of Prohibition.
   
   - The creation and maintenance of a nuisance which sensibly impairs the value of lands of private owners is a "taking" within the principle of eminent domain and condemnation proceedings thereunder, and falls within the exception as to dwellings. Selma v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 322</cite>, 111 S.E. 543 (1922).

        House standing on the right-of-way does not become the property of the condemnor.

        What Is Public Use as Question for Court.
   
   - In any proceeding for condemnation under the sovereign power of eminent domain, what is a public use is a judicial question for ultimate decision by the court as a matter of law, reviewable upon appeal. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 346</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 126 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To determine whether an exaction amounts to an unconstitutional taking,
   
   the court shall: (1) identify the condition imposed; (2) identify the regulation which caused the condition to be imposed; (3) determine whether the regulation substantially advances a legitimate state interest. If the regulation substantially advances a legitimate state interest, the court shall then determine (4) whether the condition imposed advances that interest; and (5) whether the condition imposed is proportionally related to the impact of the development. Franklin Rd. Properties v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 731, 381 S.E.2d 487 (1989), citing Batch v. Town of Chapel Hill, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretion of Condemnors as to Extent and Limit of Rights to Be Acquired.
   
   - The extent and limit of the rights to be acquired are primarily and very largely referred to the companies or grantees of the power, and only become an issuable question, usually determinable by the court, on allegation of fact tending to show bad faith on the part of the companies or an oppressive or manifest abuse of their discretion. Yadkin River Power Co. v. Wissler, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 269</cite>, 76 S.E. 267 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining what property is necessary for a public housing site, a broad discretion is vested by statute in housing authority commissioners, to whom the power of eminent domain is delegated. Housing Auth. v. Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 358</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 101 (1962); Philbrook v. Chapel Hill Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 598</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 153 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Condemnors' Discretion Not Subject to Review Absent Abuse.
   
   - Where the general power to condemn exists, the right of selection as to route, quantity, etc., is left largely to the discretion of the company or corporation, and does not become the subject of judicial inquiry except on allegations of fact tending to show bad faith on the part of the company or corporation or an oppressive and manifest abuse of the discretion conferred upon them by the law. Selma v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 322</cite>, 111 S.E. 543 (1922); Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an agency has the power of condemnation, the choice of route is primarily in its discretion and will not be reviewed on the ground that another route may have been more appropriately chosen, unless it appears that there has been an abuse of discretion. Duke Power Co. v. Ribet, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 87, 212 S.E.2d 182 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exercise of discretion by the condemnor will not be interfered with on the ground that the condemnor acted unreasonably and without justification when there is neither allegation nor evidence that the condemnor acted either arbitrarily or capriciously or in a manner constituting an abuse of discretion in the selection of the route to condemn. Duke Power Co. v. Ribet, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 87, 212 S.E.2d 182 (1975).
   <br />

        Existence of Less Intrusive Means not Abuse of Discretion.

       Procedure for Condemning Excess Property.
   
   - The condemnor may condemn property in excess of that needed for an otherwise valid public purpose, as envisioned under this section, provided that it identifies the land to be condemned, demonstrates that the unneeded remainder of property is "of little value"; the condemnor has carried its burden of proof, the condemning authority must then affirmatively demonstrate the proposed condemnation is authorized by subsection (a)(1), (2), or (3).

   - This section applies only to cases involving partial takings. Town of Hillsborough v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 547 S.E.2d 139, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 75</cite>, 553 S.E.2d 213 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Little Value" Not Shown.
   
   - Condemnor's failure on appeal to contradict the court's finding regarding the value of land it sought to condemn in excess of that needed for an otherwise valid public purpose supported the trial court's conclusion of law that the 97-acre remainder was "not of such shape, size or condition as to render it of little value."

      <p>
       Appellate review
   
   is appropriate to protect the due process rights of landowners affected by a condemnor who seeks to condemn property in excess of what is needed for an otherwise valid public purpose; de novo review of whether the condemnor has satisfied the "of little value" requirement, as well as the condemnor's burden of proof under subsection (a)(1), (2), or (3), best ensures uniform and constitutional application of this section.

      </p>
      <p>
       Constitutionality.
   
   - Statutes authorizing bodies having the power of eminent domain to enter onto land for purposes of conducting preliminary surveys and the like, containing no provision for compensation to the landowner for such use of the land, are not violative of constitutional provisions against the taking of private property for public purposes without prior payment of just compensation. Duke Power Co. v. Herndon, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 217 S.E.2d 82 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Nature of Right of Entry.
   
   - The right of entry granted a railroad company under this section is only for the purpose of marking out the route and designating the building sites desired, to the end that the parties may come to an intelligent agreement as to the price, and without the consent of the owner the company cannot enter by virtue of this section for the purpose of building its road. State v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 590</cite>, 55 S.E. 210 (1906).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Entry Prior to Condemnation Not a "Taking."
   
   - An entry for the purpose of laying out the proposed route for an easement does not constitute a "taking." Duke Power Co. v. Herndon, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 217 S.E.2d 82 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere threat to take a right-of-way under the power of eminent domain and an isolated act in going upon the land to make a preliminary survey are insufficient to constitute a "taking." Penn v. Carolina Va. Coastal Corp., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 481</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 817 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Railroad Company Not a Trespasser.
   
   - A railroad company having the right of eminent domain, entering upon and occupying lands for building its tracks, is not a trespasser. Abernathy v. South &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 97</cite>, 63 S.E. 180 (1908).

       Power of Court to Make Rules of Procedure.
   
   - The legislature, recognizing the difficulty of doing more than outlining the mode of practice so as to safeguard the rights of the parties, has conferred upon the court the power to make rules of procedure when they are not expressly provided by statute.

       Taxing of Costs Where Owner Not Entitled to Recovery.
   
   - In an action to recover damages for the taking of land for use as a sidewalk by defendant municipality, where the jury found plaintiff was entitled to recover nothing, the court could properly tax the costs against the defendant. Jervis v. Mars Hill, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 323</cite>, 199 S.E. 96 (1938), decided under prior law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under former law, when it was decided by the superior court that defendant owner's benefit equalled the damages, the plaintiff corporation would pay the costs; however, if the defendant appealed and the decision of the lower court was affirmed, then the cost of the appeal would fall upon the defendant. Madison County R.R. v. Gahagan, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 190</cite>, 76 S.E. 696 (1912), decided under prior law.

        </b>
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutes prescribing the procedure to condemn lands should be strictly construed.
   
   Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 174 S.E.2d 839 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       One cannot condemn that which he owns.
   
   VEPCO v. King, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 219</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 318 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Condemnation under the power of eminent domain is a proceeding in rem
   
   against the property. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Only when the parties cannot agree may condemnation proceedings be instituted.
   
   Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 717</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 539 (1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory method of condemning a right-of-way can be exercised when the parties are unable to agree upon the terms of acquisition. Allen v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 381</cite>, 9 S.E. 4 (1889).
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the right of eminent domain accrues to the condemnor, there must exist an inability to agree for the purchase price. This has been held to be a preliminary jurisdictional fact. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Matthis, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 163 S.E.2d 35 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       And Condemnor Must First Make a Bona Fide Effort to Purchase.
   
   - Before the agency seeking to acquire can ask the court to condemn, it must make a bona fide effort to purchase by private negotiation. VEPCO v. King, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 219</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 318 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless Minors Are Interested in Land Sought to Be Acquired.
   
   - It is not required of a quasi public service corporation authorized to condemn land that it first endeavor to agree with the owners when it is made to appear that infants have an interest therein, and otherwise that a title to the lands could not be acquired in such way. Western Carolina Power Co. v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 744</cite>, 133 S.E. 5 (1926).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Procedure Applicable Only to Acquisition of Right, etc., to Specific Land.
   
   - Provisions for commissioners, appraisal, viewing the premises, etc., are applicable only to instances where the condemnor acquires title and right to possession of specific land. Eller v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 584</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 144 (1955).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Procedure Not Applicable to Trespasses.
   
   - Provisions with regard to procedure by private condemnors only apply to the mode of acquiring title to real estate and getting a right-of-way, and have no application to trespasses committed outside of the right-of-way in building the road; for such trespasses, the corporations are liable in a civil action. Bridgers v. Dill, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 222</cite>, 1 S.E. 767 (1887).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability of Procedure to Railroads.
   
   - The method of proceeding prescribed for the condemnation of land by railroad corporations is applicable to all railroads, whether formed under the general law or special act of incorporation. Allen v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 381</cite>, 9 S.E. 4 (1889).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Condemnation by Department of Transportation.
   
   - The procedure prescribed by former G.S. 40-11, et seq. was applicable to condemnation proceedings instituted by the Board (now Department) of Transportation prior to July 1, 1960, while the procedure presently applicable to condemnation proceedings by the Board (now Department) of Transportation is prescribed by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.136.html#t136a09s136-103" target="_blank">G.S. 136-103</a></cite> et seq.

       Conversion of Private Condemnation Proceeding into Quiet Title Action.
   
   - Trial court did not err by applying <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 15(b) in such a way as to convert condemnation proceeding brought by private condemnors with the consent of the parties, into an action to quiet title.

      <p>
       Payment Prerequisite to Right of Entry.
   
   - If the parties cannot agree, the company may proceed to condemn the land; it does not acquire the right to enter for the purpose of constructing the road until the amount of the appraisement has been paid into court. State v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 590</cite>, 55 S.E. 210 (1906).

       A condemnor acquires no right to possession in a condemnation proceeding until it pays into court the value of the subject property, as determined by appraisers. City of Kings Mountain v. Goforth, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 316</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 231 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Payment Prerequisite to Acquisition of Title.
   
   - A condemnor acquires no title to the property until it obtains a final judgment and pays to the landowner the amount of compensation fixed by such judgment. City of Kings Mountain v. Goforth, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 316</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 231 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of Property by Owner Until Payment.
   
   - Absent unusual circumstances, the landowner may continue to use his property from the commencement of a condemnation proceeding until the payment into court by the condemnor of the value of the property as determined by commissioners, to the same extent and in the same manner as he had been using it prior to commencement of the condemnation proceeding. City of Kings Mountain v. Goforth, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 316</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 231 (1973).

       Each owner is entitled to defend
   
   upon the ground that his property does not qualify for the purpose intended, or that its selection was the result of arbitrary or capricious conduct on the part of the taking agency. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).

       Election to Sue for Damages.
   
   - Where a railroad or other public service corporation has made the entry, appropriated the right-of-way, constructed its road and is operating the same, and neither party has seen fit to resort to the statutory method, the owner of the land has the right at his election to sue for permanent damages, and on payment of the same the easement will pass to the defendant.

     </h3>
     <p>
      For the purpose of acquiring property a condemnor listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa01s40A-3ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 40A-3(a)</a></cite>, or the owner of the property sought to be condemned, may present a petition to the clerk of the superior court of any county in which the real estate described in the petition is situated, praying for the appointment of commissioners of appraisal. The petition shall be signed and verified. If filed by the condemnor, it must contain a description of the property which the condemnor seeks to acquire; and it must state that the condemnor is duly incorporated, and that it is its intention in good faith to conduct and carry on the public business authorized by its charter, stating in detail the nature of its public business, and the specific use of the property; and that the property described in the petition is required for the purpose of conducting the proposed business. The petition, if filed by the condemnor, must also contain a statement as to whether the owner will be permitted to remove all or a specified portion of any buildings, structures, permanent improvements, or fixtures situated on or affixed to the land. The petition, whether filed by the condemnor or the owner, must also state the names and places of residence of all other owners, so far as the same can by reasonable diligence be ascertained, or those who claim to be owners of the property. If any such persons are infants, their ages, as near as may be known, must be stated; and if any such persons are incompetents, inebriates or are unknown, that fact must be stated, together with any other allegations and statements of liens or encumbrances on the property which the condemnor or the owner may see fit to make.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this section shall in any manner affect an owner's common-law right to bring an action in tort for damage to his property.

       <p>
        Perfunctory Proceeding Not Intended.
   
   - A perfunctory proceeding leading automatically to the granting of the petition is not contemplated by the law; the landowner may deny any of the allegations in the petition, and is entitled to a hearing before commissioners are appointed to appraise the damages he will sustain if his property is taken. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Taking" Prerequisite to Proceeding by Owner.
   
   - The owner's right to have the land appraised must necessarily be predicated upon a taking of the property by the corporation possessing the right of eminent domain. And "taking" under the power of eminent domain may be defined as entering upon private property for more than a momentary period, and, under warrant or color of legal authority, devoting it to a public use, or otherwise informally appropriating or injuriously affecting it in such a way as substantially to oust the owner and deprive him of all beneficial enjoyment thereof. Penn v. Carolina Va. Coastal Corp., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 481</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 817 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Owner may not maintain a proceeding for the assessment of damages until there has been a taking of his property under the power of eminent domain; hence, demurrer to a petition was properly sustained when its allegations amounted to no more than that respondent had threatened to take an easement and had made preliminary surveys incidental thereto, since in such instance the petition failed to allege a taking of the property. Penn v. Carolina Va. Coastal Corp., <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 481</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 817 (1950).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Recovery of Compensation Where Taking Not for Private Purpose.
   
   - Where there was no evidence upon the record showing that the taking over of a road was for a private purpose sufficient to raise an issue of fact, the plaintiff was remitted to his rights for the recovery of just compensation. Reed v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 648</cite>, 184 S.E. 513 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Recovery of Consideration Agreed On.
   
   - Where the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) failed to pay consideration for a right-of-way easement executed by landowners in accordance with an agreement, the landowners could bring an action at law in the superior court to recover such consideration; a special condemnation proceeding was not proper. Sale v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 612</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 290 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Setting Aside of Fraudulent Deed.
   
   - Where a deed for a right-of-way was obtained from a landowner by fraud on the part of a railroad company, the superior court had jurisdiction to set aside the conveyance, but could not go further in the same action and ascertain and enforce payment of damages suffered by the grantor by reason of the appropriation of his land as a right-of-way by the company, although such appropriation was made by the company under the deed in question. Allen v. Wilmington &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 381</cite>, 9 S.E. 4 (1889).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that cotenant granted a right-of-way to railroad would not prevent another owner from instituting proceedings
   
   for the assessment of damages sustained by him, nor would such facts prevent the cotenant who had made such grant from becoming a party to the proceedings and having his rights adjusted thereunder, upon a claim that the company had forfeited its right under the grant by failure to comply with the conditions thereof, even though such forfeiture did not occur until after the petition was filed by the cotenant. Hill v. Glendon &amp; Gulf Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 259</cite>, 18 S.E. 171 (1893).

       </p>
       <p>
        Proceedings Involving Telegraph Companies.
   
   - Inasmuch as former G.S. 56-7 set forth all the necessary statements for the petition of the telegraph company, and former G.S. 56-8 provided for its service, only so much of the railroad law as directed proceedings after the petition was before the court was made applicable to telegraph companies. Phillips v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 513</cite>, 41 S.E. 1022, rev'd on other grounds on rehearing, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 225</cite>, 42 S.E. 587 (1902).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Joinder - Of Interested Parties Generally.
   
   - The petition, whether filed by an owner or by the company, should state the names of all persons interested, and all of them should be in court before the commissioners are appointed. Hill v. Glendon &amp; Gulf Mining &amp; Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 259</cite>, 18 S.E. 171 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by the owner of an interest in lands against the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to recover compensation for the taking of a portion of the land, the joinder, as a respondent, of the owner of the other interest in the land did not result in a misjoinder of parties and causes, since the action was to enforce a single right to recover compensation, and the joinder of all parties having an interest in the land was required. Tyson v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 732</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 630 (1959).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Joinder - Of Owners of Several Tracts.
   
   - Where it is sought to condemn several tracts of land belonging to different owners, all the owners may be joined in one proceeding in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary. Such a course is convenient, and can injure no one if damages are separately assessed to each owner. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial of Intervenor's Claim Not Required Prior to Intervention.
   
   - The court is not required to try and determine the validity of a claim of ownership advanced by an omitted claimant before it permits him to intervene in the proceeding for the purpose of asserting his claim. City of Raleigh v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 528</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 669 (1951).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Clerk Held to Have Jurisdiction.
   
   - Where the charter of a railroad company provided that it might condemn land by a proceeding commenced before a court of record having common-law jurisdiction, it was held that the clerk of a superior court had jurisdiction of such proceeding. Durham &amp; N.R.R. v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 16</cite>, 10 S.E. 1041 (1890).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Clerk and Court had Jurisdiction.
   
   - Trial court abused its discretion by denying a private-party condemnor's motion to amend its petition to condemn easements for a power line across two counties because the clerk of court and the trial court very clearly had jurisdiction over at least the property located in the county where the court was located, the condemnor sought leave to amend to correct its misunderstanding of the statute, and the trial court did not address any of the applicable categories. Rutherford Elec. Mbrshp. Corp. v. 130 of Chatham, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 87, 763 S.E.2d 296 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Right to Require Proceeding before Clerk.
   
   - Where a city was sued for damages for running its water-supply pipe on the plaintiff's lands, and it was made to appear that the pipeline was upon the State's highway over the plaintiff's land, the plaintiff, as the servient owner, could maintain his action; the denial of his title or right by the defendant was a waiver of its right that the plaintiff should have proceeded before the clerk under this section, so that the plaintiff could maintain his action of trespass in the superior court. Rouse v. Kinston, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 1</cite>, 123 S.E. 482 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Preliminary Hearing.
   
   - Where it was stipulated by the parties in condemnation proceedings that a hearing before commissioners appointed by the clerk should be waived, and judgment was rendered determining the amount of damages, and on appeal the Supreme Court affirmed the judgment as to the compensation allowed and remanded the cause for error in the exclusion of another element of compensation to which defendants were entitled, on the subsequent trial to determine the amount recoverable on such other element of compensation the parties were bound by the stipulation waiving a preliminary hearing by commissioners, and plaintiff's exception to the trial of the issue without such preliminary hearing would not be sustained. State ex rel. Myers v. Wilmington-Wrightsville Beach Causeway Co., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 508</cite>, 171 S.E. 859 (1933).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Clerk's Findings of Facts Not Final.
   
   - The finding of the facts of the clerk upon preliminary allegations in condemnation proceedings are not final and may be appealed from. Johnson City S.R.R. v. South &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 59</cite>, 61 S.E. 683 (1908).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessity of Taking Is Legislative Question.
   
   - As a general rule, once the public purpose is established, the necessity or expediency of the taking is a legislative, and not a judicial question. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 245 S.E.2d 390, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 548</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 726 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 912, 99 S.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judicial Inquiry into Allegations of Bad Faith.
   
   - Upon specific allegations tending to show bad faith, malice, wantonness, or oppressive and manifest abuse of discretion by the condemnor, the issue raised becomes the subject of judicial inquiry as a question of fact to be determined by the judge. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 662, 245 S.E.2d 390, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 548</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 726 (1978), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 912, 99 S. Ct. 1224, 59 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1979).

        Sufficiency of Petition.
   
   - A petition to condemn land for urban renewal is sufficient under the Rules of Civil Procedure to state a claim for relief where it gives notice of the nature and basis of the petitioners' claim and the type of case brought, and alleges generally the occurrence or performance of the conditions precedent.

       <p>
        Energy company's petition for condemnation in order to condemn an easement across the property owner's property as part of a plan to build a power line across the forum county was sufficient to describe the easement, as the petition included a legal description of the property and the easement area, described the intended use of the easement, and further described the nature of the right, title, and interest sought to be condemned.

   - Ordinarily, condemnation proceedings are instituted by the condemnor by petition containing an accurate description of the property which it seeks to condemn, thereby placing the landowner on the defendant's side of the indexes and cross-indexes of the public records and furnishing accessible means by which the property may be identified. Hughes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 121</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 321 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Description of the Entire Tract Required.
   
   - A description of the property sought to be acquired, and not merely a description of the entire tract over which the right-of-way, privilege, or easement is to run, is necessary. City of Gastonia v. Glenn, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 510</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 459 (1940).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the condemnor seeks to follow the procedure permitted by statute, his petition must contain a description of the property actually in litigation, and not merely a description of the entire tract. The property must "first be located." Hughes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 121</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 321 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        With Reference to Uncontroverted Monuments.
   
   - It is for the condemnor to determine what land it seeks to condemn and to describe it in its petition by reference to uncontroverted monuments. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Creasman, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 390</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 497 (1964); Duke Power Co. v. Herndon, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 217 S.E.2d 82 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The condemnor must "first locate the property."
   
   Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Creasman, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 390</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 497 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Owner Should Know Exact Limits.
   
   - The statutory procedure for the award of just compensation to the owner of private property appropriated to public use presupposes that the owner shall know with certainty the exact limits of the appropriation made. Cannon v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 711</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 595 (1955), cert. denied, 352 U.S. 842, 77 S. Ct. 66, 1 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Filing of Map and Profile Required.
   
   - It is deemed necessary, so that the landowner may know what land is intended to be appropriated and can have his grievances adjusted, to require the filing of maps, profiles, etc. Durham &amp; N.R.R. v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 16</cite>, 10 S.E. 1041 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        The filing of a proper profile is a condition precedent before an order of condemnation shall be granted to a railroad. Kinston &amp; C.R.R. v. Stroud, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. 413</cite>, 43 S.E. 913 (1903).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to file a map and profile may be cured by amendment.
   
   Holly Shelter R.R. v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 132</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 136</cite>, 45 S.E. 549 (1903); State v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 590</cite>, 55 S.E. 210 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only Property Described May Be Acquired.
   
   - Ordinarily, absent an amendment, the only property a condemnor may acquire is that described in the petition. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Creasman, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 390</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 497 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Remedy for Failure of Agency to Define Extent of Claim.
   
   - Where the State Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) claimed a right-of-way over land, the landowner was entitled as a matter of right to require that the Commission (now Department) define with particularity the location and extent of its claim and if it refused or failed to do so, the landowner could invoke the remedy of mandamus. Cannon v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 711</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 595 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Allegation of Damages.
   
   - In a special proceeding to assess compensation for land taken from an educational institution for highway purposes, it was not required that petitioners allege with particularity the various respects in which the property was adversely affected by the new highway, and since evidence in support of all elements of damage recoverable is competent under the general allegation of damage, petitioners were not prejudiced by an order striking from the petition allegations relating thereto. Gallimore v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 350</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 392 (1955).

       Strict Construction.
   
   - Statutes prescribing the procedure to condemn lands should be strictly construed. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 174 S.E.2d 839, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1970).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative Intent with Regard to Parties.
   
   - Tenant having month-to-month tenancy based upon periodic rental payments without a written document is a person having an estate or interest affected by condemnation proceedings; if the legislature had intended to give a diminished status to month-to-month tenancies, it could have expressly done so. Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. v. Calco Enters., <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 237, 511 S.E.2d 671 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The clerk is to hold the hearing on the challenge only after notice
   
   to the parties. Collins v. North Carolina State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 277</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 709 (1953); City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory procedure is designed to provide to the landowner a fair determination of his damages; it would be converted into a farce if it were construed to permit the clerk to appoint commissioners, the commissioners to meet and determine the damages and report the same to the clerk, and the clerk 20 days later to enter a final judgment, all with no notice whatever to the landowner, other than the original summons in the proceedings, and all before the time for filing his answer, as extended by the clerk, expired. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden on Respondent.
   
   - Trial court's finding that the energy company's condemnation of part of the property owner's property to condemn an easement across the property would not affect the property owner's reasonable-size garden was supported by the evidence, and thus the order granting condemnation would not be overturned; the property owner, as the respondent, had the burden of proof to show that condemnation in the private condemnation proceeding initiated by the energy company would not be proper and the property owner did not meet that burden. Progress Energy Carolinas, Inc. v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 640 S.E.2d 856 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Notice of Hearing.
   
   - If the landowner is given notice of the hearing before the clerk, this would, no doubt, be sufficient to charge him with notice of an order entered by the clerk, at such hearing, appointed commissioners and fixing the time and place for their first meeting. In turn, this would charge him with notice of actions of the commissioners at such first meeting, including the adjournment of such meeting to another time and place. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice of Motions.
   
   - All motions made before the clerk, other than those grantable as a matter of course or those specifically provided for by law, require notice to the parties affected thereby. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Advisability of Street Widening Project in Discretion of Aldermen.
   
   - The advisability of widening a street is a matter committed by law to the sound discretion of the aldermen, with which neither the defendants nor the courts can interfere; it is a political and administrative measure of which the defendants are not even entitled to notice or to be heard. Durham v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 128</cite>, 53 S.E. 531 (1906).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Railroad as Judge of Necessity of Land for Right-of-Way.
   
   - A railroad company is entitled to so much of the right-of-way as may be necessary for the purpose of the company; hence, the denial by a person in the possession of a portion of the right-of-way that the portion in controversy was necessary for the purposes of the company did not raise an issue of fact to be determined by a jury, as the company was the judge of the necessity and extent of such use. Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Olive, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 257</cite>, 55 S.E. 263 (1906).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Extent of Rights to Be Acquired Are an Issuable Question.
   
   - The extent and limit of the rights to be acquired are primarily and very largely referred to the companies or grantees of the power, and only becomes an issuable question, usually determinable by the court, on allegation of fact tending to show bad faith on the part of the companies or an oppressive or manifest abuse of their discretion. Yadkin River Power Co. v. Wissler, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 269</cite>, 76 S.E. 267 (1912), distinguishing, Carolina Cent. R.R. v. Love, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. 434</cite> (1879).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Clerk Without Authority to Appoint Commissioners Until Determination of Controverted Facts.
   
   - In a special proceeding to condemn land for urban renewal, the clerk of superior court does not have authority to issue an order appointing commissioners of appraisal where respondents deny the allegations of the petition; the record must show that after a proper hearing the controverted facts had been determined in favor of petitioner, the clerk's finding that commissioners should be appointed not being a sufficient finding of the controverted facts. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 174 S.E.2d 839 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Procedure Where Issuable Matters Are Raised Before Clerk.
   
   - Where issuable matters are raised before the clerk he should pass upon these matters presented in the record, and have the land assessed through commissioners, as the statute directs, allowing the parties, by exceptions, to raise any question of law or fact issuable or otherwise to be considered on appeal to the superior court from his award of damages, as provided by law. Selma v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 322</cite>, 111 S.E. 543 (1922).
      </p>

       When respondents in a special proceeding to condemn land for urban renewal deny the allegations of the petition, the clerk of superior court has the duty, after notice, to hear the parties and pass upon the disputed matters presented on the record; if the allegations of the petition are found to be true, the clerk must then appoint commissioners to appraise the property and assess damages for the taking.

       Procedure Where Only Issue of Just Compensation Is Raised.
   
   - Where the answer does not deny the right of the city to acquire the desired easements by condemnation and raises no issue save that of just compensation, the only matter to be determined by the clerk at the initial hearing is the selection and appointment of the commissioners and the fixing of the time and place for their first meeting.

       Pretrial Conference.
   
   - In a condemnation proceeding, the trial court should conduct a pretrial conference where the record shows that the parties have different concepts of what phase of the matter they are going to try.

       Appeal from Ruling of Clerk.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The commissioners, before entering upon the discharge of their duties, shall take and subscribe an oath that they will fairly and impartially appraise the property in the petition. Any one of them may issue subpoenas, administer oaths to witnesses, and any two of them may adjourn the proceedings before them from time to time, in their discretion. Whenever they meet, except by the appointment of the clerk or pursuant to adjournment, they shall cause 10 days' notice of such meeting to be given to the parties who are affected by their proceedings, or their attorney or agent. They shall view the premises described in the petition, hear the proofs and allegations of the parties, and reduce the testimony, if any is taken by them, to writing. After the testimony is closed in each case, and without any unnecessary delay, and before proceeding to the examination of any other claim, a majority of the commissioners being present and acting, shall ascertain and determine the compensation which ought justly to be made by the condemnor to the owners of the property appraised by them. The commissioners shall determine the compensation to be awarded in accordance with the principles established by Article 4 of this Chapter. They shall report the same to the clerk within 10 days.

        Determination of Commissioners Not an Interference with Right to Jury Trial.
   
   - It seems to have been settled in Raleigh &amp; G.R.R. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. 451</cite> (1837), that the Constitution guarantees the right to trial by jury in controversies respecting property only in cases where, under the common law, the demand that the facts should be so found could not have been refused, and that in fixing the quantum of compensation to the landowner for a right-of-way condemned to the use of a railroad, commissioners do not invade the province that, under the ancient law, belonged peculiarly and exclusively to the jury. Chowan &amp; S.R.R. v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 246</cite>, 11 S.E. 328 (1890).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Availability of Method to Landowner.
   
   - The method prescribed for arriving at compensation for condemnation of land is open to the landowner as well. Hughes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 121</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 321 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Allegation of Compliance with Statutory Requirements.
   
   - In order to invoke the power of eminent domain, a redevelopment commission must affirmatively allege compliance with the statutory requirements. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The law contemplates notice to the landowner of the meeting of the commissioners
   
   at which they are to "hear" his proofs and allegations. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice Required.
   
   - The commissioners are required to give the parties or their attorneys notice of the meeting at which the report is adopted and ordered filed. Collins v. North Carolina State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 277</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 709 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory procedure is designed to provide to the landowner a fair determination of his damages. It would be converted into a farce if it were construed to permit the clerk to appoint commissioners, the commissioners to meet and determine the damages and report the same to the clerk, and the clerk 20 days later to enter a final judgment, all with no notice whatever to the landowner, other than the original summons in the proceedings, and all before the time for filing his answer, as extended by the clerk, expired. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If the landowner is given notice of the hearing before the clerk, this would, no doubt, be sufficient
   
   to charge him with notice of an order entered by the clerk, at such hearing, appointing commissioners and fixing the time and place for their first meeting. In turn, this would charge him with notice of actions of the commissioners at such first meeting, including the adjournment of such meeting to another time and place. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>

        Statutory procedure for condemnation does not contemplate that commissioners pass upon issues of fact
   
   prerequisite to an adjudication as to whether a landowner is entitled to recover for an alleged appropriation by use of an easement of flight. City of Charlotte v. Spratt, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 656</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 341 (1965).

        Report Held to Fail to Show Hearing.
   
   - A commissioners' report that simply stated that the commissioners met on a certain day in the office of the clerk and subsequently visited the premises of the defendant, and after taking into full consideration the quality and quantity of the land involved, and all inconveniences likely to result to defendant from the condemnation of the rights-of-way, asserted the damages at zero, did not purport to show any hearing by the commissioners of the proofs and allegations of the parties, as required both by law and by the order of the clerk.

         Passing of Cause for Flooding with Conveyance of Property.
        </b>
        - The right to flood lands in derogation of plaintiff's easement of access does not arise merely upon the erection of the structure causing the flooding, but upon the institution of proceedings looking to the award of due compensation; and until such proceedings are instituted by one side or the other, the flooding constitutes a mere invasion of rights which pass with a conveyance of the property to which they are attached.

         II. COMPENSATION.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Meaning of "Compensation which Ought Justly To Be Made".
   
   - It seems to be the general rule in this jurisdiction that "the compensation which ought justly to be made" is such compensation after special benefits peculiar to the land are set off against damages. Stamey v. Burnsville, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 39</cite>, 126 S.E. 103 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Compensation to Be Paid to Individual Who Owns Property at Time of Taking.
        </b>
        - Compensation for property taken in the exercise of the power of eminent domain is due to the owner at the time of the taking, and not to the owner at an earlier or later date. Empie v. United States, 131 F.2d 481 (4th Cir. 1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonowner Not Entitled to Compensation.
   
   - If plaintiff does not own the land upon which the defendant has constructed its road and imposed a burden, he has nothing to be "taken," and therefore nothing for which he is entitled to compensation. Abernathy v. South &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 97</cite>, 63 S.E. 180 (1908).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The owner is entitled to compensation for actual and direct damages
   
   which he may sustain by being deprived of his property. Raleigh, C. &amp; S.R.R. v. Mecklenburg Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 168</cite>, 82 S.E. 5 (1914), dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 156</cite>, 85 S.E. 390 (1915).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only Actual and Direct Damage Considered.
   
   - In estimating damages of any kind to lands taken by a railroad company, it is only proper to consider actual damages, not those remote or speculative or dependent upon a future possible use of the property. Madison County R. R. v. Gahagan, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 190</cite>, 76 S.E. 696 (1912).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Damage to Adjoining Lands Included.
   
   - The landowner will be entitled to have included in his assessment damages for injuries to lands adjoining those upon which the railroad is constructed. Hendrick v. Carolina Cent. R.R., <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. 617</cite>, 8 S.E. 236 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        Damages are limited to those which embrace the actual value of the property taken and the direct physical injuries to the remaining property. Raleigh, C. &amp; S.R.R. v. Mecklenburg Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 168</cite>, 82 S.E. 5 (1914), dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 156</cite>, 85 S.E. 390 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        The owner of land, a part of which is taken under the right of eminent domain, may recover as compensation not only the value of the land taken, but also the damages thereby caused, if any, to the remaining land. Western Carolina Power Co. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 104</cite>, 136 S.E. 353 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Measure of Damages.
   
   - In condemnation proceedings the measure of damages is not the difference between the value of the owner's property before and after the taking, but the fair value of the land taken reduced by any special benefits received. Stamey v. Burnsville, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 39</cite>, 126 S.E. 103 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Basis of Damage Calculation.
   
   - Damages are not assessed upon the idea of a proposed actual dominion, occupation and perception of the profits of the whole right-of-way by the corporation; rather, the calculation is based on the principle that possession and exclusive control will be asserted only over so much of the condemned territory as may be necessary for corporate purposes, such as additional tracks, ditches and houses to be used for stations and section hands. Blue v. Aberdeen &amp; W.E.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 644</cite>, 23 S.E. 275 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two elements of damages legally cognizable
   
   in condemnation actions: (1) compensation for the value of property taken, and (2) compensation for any delay in paying for the property once it is taken. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 263</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 149 (1982), decided under former G.S. 40-17.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inclusion of Market Value in Damage Estimate.
   
   - In awarding damages to the owner of lands for an easement therein acquired for railroad purposes, there should, as a general rule, be included the market value of the land actually covered by the right-of-way, subject to modification under special circumstances, as where there is a mineral deposit with the use of which the easement does not interfere. Virginia &amp; C.S.R.R. v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 498</cite>, 74 S.E. 461 (1912).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Criteria in Estimating Fair Market Value.
   
   - In estimating the fair market value of property acquired by eminent domain, all of the capabilities of the property and all of the uses to which it may be applied or for which it is adapted which affect its value in the market are to be considered, and not merely the condition it is in at the time and the use to which it is then applied by the owner. City of Statesville v. Bowles, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 169 S.E.2d 467 (1969), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 497</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 111 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Matters such as the accessibility of the property, its slope and elevation, and the costs that will be involved for necessary grading and filling are often important factors to be considered in arriving at an opinion as to its value. City of Statesville v. Bowles, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 169 S.E.2d 467 (1969), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 497</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 111 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The use of property in combination with other property may be considered
   
   as a basis for awarding damages if the possibility of combination is so reasonably sufficient and the use so reasonably probable as to affect the market value. City of Statesville v. Bowles, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 169 S.E.2d 467 (1969), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 497</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 111 (1971).

        Compensation for Additional Burdens.
   
   - When a railroad company puts additional burdens upon a right-of-way which it has acquired by condemnation, not properly embraced in the general purpose for which it was obtained, the owner is entitled to compensation for them. Virginia &amp; C.S.R.R. v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 498</cite>, 74 S.E. 461 (1912).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Such as a Telegraph Line.
   
   - Telegraph line along a railroad and on the right-of-way of the railroad is an additional burden upon the land, for which the landowner is entitled to just compensation. Phillips v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 513</cite>, 41 S.E. 1022, 89 Am. St. R. 868, rev'd on other grounds on rehearing, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 225</cite>, 42 S.E. 587 (1902); Hodges v. Western Union Tel. Co., <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 225</cite>, 45 S.E. 572 (1903); Query v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 639</cite>, 101 S.E. 390, 8 A.L.R. 1290 (1919).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Or Sewer and Water Lines.
   
   - Where a city proposes to lay sewer and water lines in the right-of-way of a State highway, the owner of the fee in this land is entitled to just compensation for an additional burden beyond that of the original easement for the highway. The laying of a water main or sewer line in the right-of-way of a highway is an additional burden upon the owner of the fee. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Not Street Railway.
   
   - The use of streets for a street railway is one of the ordinary purposes for which streets and highways may be used, and does not impose an additional burden or servitude so as to entitle the abutting property owner to further compensation. Hester v. Durham Traction Co., <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 288</cite>, 50 S.E. 711, 1 L.R.A. (n.s.) 981 (1905).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Value Determined as of Date of Taking.
   
   - For the purpose of determining the sum to be paid as compensation for land taken under the right of eminent domain, the value of the land taken should be ascertained as of the date of the taking. The land is taken within the meaning of this principle when the proceeding is begun. Western Carolina Power Co. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 104</cite>, 136 S.E. 353 (1927); Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 263</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 149 (1982), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-17" target="_blank">G.S. 41-17</a></cite>.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Later Changes in Value Are Not Considered.
   
   - No change in the value of the land after the date of commencement of the proceeding, whether caused by the use for which it is to be condemned or not, can be considered in determining the amount which the owners shall receive and the petitioner shall pay as just compensation. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 263</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 149 (1982), decided under former G.S. 40-17.

       <p>
        Legislature has the power to allow municipal corporations to have general benefits assessed as offsets
   
   against damages in an action to acquire land for a public purpose, but the power or authority must be given either by special charter or general state act. Stamey v. Burnsville, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 39</cite>, 126 S.E. 103 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        General benefits are those which arise from fulfillment of the public object
   
   which justified the taking. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Mode, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 163 S.E.2d 429 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Special benefits are those which arise from the peculiar relation
   
   of the land in question to the public improvement. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Mode, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 464, 163 S.E.2d 429 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the compensation to be paid, account must be taking of benefits
   
   to the owner's property from the construction of the proposed improvement. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        What Pecuniary Advantages Deducted from Damages.
   
   - The owner of lands through which a railroad has acquired a right-of-way by condemnation is entitled to recover therefor the damages done to the remainder of the tract or portions of the land used by him as one tract, deducting from the estimate the pecuniary benefits or advantages which are special and peculiar to the tract in question, but not those which are shared by him in common with other owners of lands of like kind in the same vicinity. Virginia &amp; C.S.R.R. v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. 498</cite>, 74 S.E. 461 (1912). See also, Freedle v. North Carolina R.R., <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 89</cite> (1856); Southport, W. &amp; D.R.R. v. Owners of Platt Land, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 266</cite>, 45 S.E. 589 (1903).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admissibility of Evidence Showing Value.
   
   - In a proceeding to condemn land for a right-of-way, evidence to show the value of the land by its location and surroundings is admissible, but a tax list is not admissible for that purpose. Suffolk &amp; C. Ry. v. West End Land &amp; Imp. Co., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 330</cite>, 49 S.E. 350 (1904).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Expert Appraisers To Give Reasons for Opinion of Value.
   
   - It is proper and in fact desirable that expert real estate appraisers give the reasons upon which they base their opinion as to the fair market value of property immediately before and immediately after a taking for a sanitary sewer line easement. City of Statesville v. Bowles, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 169 S.E.2d 467 (1969), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 497</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 111 (1971).

        Finding of commissioners that land taken for railroad purposes received no special benefit is conclusive.

      <p>
       Report of the commissioners is not invalid because it does not contain a description of the land,
   
   as that can be ascertained by reference to the location of the roadbed and right-of-way. Hanes v. North Carolina R.R., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 490</cite>, 13 S.E. 896 (1891).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Easement should be described in the report
   
   of the commissioners as fully and correctly as it would be in a grant, as the easement is conveyed to the petitioner by the report when confirmed. Suffolk &amp; C.Ry. v. West End Land &amp; Imp. Co., <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 330</cite>, 49 S.E. 350 (1904).

      <p>
       Seal Not Required.
   
   - While it was formerly provided that the report of the commissioners should be under seal, this provision was not mandatory, but directory only, and omission of the seal was not a fatal defect. Hanes v. North Carolina R.R., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 490</cite>, 13 S.E. 896 (1891).

       Upon the filing of the report, the clerk shall forthwith mail copies to the parties. Within 20 days after the filing of the report any party to the proceedings may file exceptions thereto.

       If no exceptions are filed to the report, and if the clerk's final judgment rendered upon the petition and proceedings shall be in favor of the condemnor, and upon the deposit by the condemnor of the sum adjudged, together with all costs allowed, into the office of the clerk of superior court, then, in that event, all owners who have been made parties to the proceedings shall be divested of the property or interest therein to the extent set forth in the proceedings. A copy of the judgment, certified under the seal of the court, shall be registered in the county or counties where the land is situated, and the original judgment, or a certified copy thereof, or a certified copy of the registered judgment, may be given in evidence in all actions and proceedings as deeds for property are now allowed in evidence.

       Any party to the proceedings may file exceptions to the clerk's final determination on any exceptions to the report and may appeal to the judge of superior court having jurisdiction. Notice of appeal shall be filed within 10 days of the clerk's final determination. Upon appeal the clerk shall transfer the proceedings to the civil issue docket of the superior court. A judge in session shall hear and determine all matters in controversy and, subject to G.S. 40A-29 regarding trial by jury, shall determine any issues of compensation to be awarded in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of this Chapter.

        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Strict Construction.
   
   - The exercise of the power of eminent domain is in derogation of common right, and all laws conferring such power must be strictly construed. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 163 S.E.2d 118 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Acquiring Fee Not Restricted.
   
   - The legislature did not intend, by referring to the procedure to be used in acquiring by condemnation, to restrict the power of acquiring in fee when necessary; the reference was merely for procedural purposes. Town of Morganton v. Hutton &amp; Bourbonnais Co., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 531</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 111 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Estoppel to Contest Right to Condemn.
   
   - All questions, except the question of just compensation, were rendered moot by a stipulation which agreed that a city's payment; should be treated as if it were the amount of damages assessed by commissioners and paid into the office of the clerk of the superior court, and in the face of the stipulation that upon payment of the stipulated sum the city would acquire title, defendants were estopped to contest the city's right to condemn. City of Kings Mountain v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 269</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 284 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Temporary and Permanent Possession by Condemnor Distinguished.
   
   - Temporary possession, pendente lite, subject to removal by final adverse judgment, is quite different from a final judicial determination that the condemnor is entitled as a matter of right to permanent possession. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 163 S.E.2d 118 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Grant by Charter of Power to Enter before Condemnation.
   
   - The legislature may by charter empower a railroad company to enter land and construct a road before instituting condemnation proceedings. Compensation must be provided to warrant the taking, but it need not precede the taking, and the owner is confined to the special remedy given him by the statute under which his property is seized. State v. Lyle, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. 497</cite>, 6 S.E. 379 (1888); Watauga &amp; Y.R.R. v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 70</cite>, 85 S.E. 156 (1915); State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 753</cite>, 87 S.E. 235 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the legislature intended to confer the right to enter before the assessment is made or the damage paid, it has so declared in express terms in the charter. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 613</cite>, 52 S.E. 240 (1905).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirement of Payment before Entry.
   
   - Formerly the landowner had no right to a jury trial in fixing compensation upon condemnation of the right-of-way, nor was the compensation required to be paid before entry; now the company is required to pay into court the sum assessed before entry. Holly Shelter R.R. v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 132</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 136</cite>, 45 S.E. 549 (1903); State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 613</cite>, 52 S.E. 240 (1905).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions Granting Temporary Possession and Use Not Applicable to Cartway Proceedings.
   
   - Provision giving the court authority to give possession and use of land to the condemnor pending appeal is not applicable to proceedings to establish a Cartway brought under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.136.html#t136a04s136-68" target="_blank">G.S. 136-68</a></cite> et seq. Lowe v. Rhodes, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 111, 175 S.E.2d 721 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of Damages into Court Pendente Lite Does Not Vest Title in Condemnor.
   
   - In proceedings to condemn land for a school site, the payment into court by the county board of education of the amount of damages assessed by the commissioners and the taking of possession by it under order of the clerk, while the cause remained pending for trial on exceptions directed both to petitioner's right to condemn and to the adequacy of the damages awarded by the commissioners, did not vest title in the board. Topping v. State Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 291</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 502 (1959).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The title of the landowner is not divested until final confirmation and payment
   
   in full of the amount appraised. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co. v. Whiting Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 560</cite>, 184 S.E. 48 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the value of lands taken in condemnation proceedings is fixed as of the date the petition is filed, title to the land does not pass until the award, as assessed by the commissioners, is paid into court after confirmation of the commissioners' report. Bemis Hardwood Lumber Co. v. Graham County, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 167</cite>, 198 S.E. 843 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The title of the landowner is not divested unless and until the condemnor obtains a final judgment in his favor and pays to the landowner the amount of the damages fixed by such final judgment. Topping v. State Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 291</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 502 (1959); North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. York Indus. Center, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 230</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 253 (1964); Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Injunction to Restrain Entry Refused.
   
   - Where a railroad company seeking to condemn land for its right-of-way gave ample bond to cover any damages resulting from its wrongful entry upon the land, an injunction would not issue to restrain such company from entering upon the land before the appraisal of damages and the payment thereof into court. Wellington &amp; P.R.R. v. Cashie &amp; C.R.R. &amp; Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 924</cite>, 20 S.E. 964 (1895); Holly Shelter R.R. v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 132</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 136</cite>, 45 S.E. 549 (1903).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Date of Valuation Not Dependent on Whether Deposit Made.
   
   - The only thing which turns on the making of the deposit is the right of possession. The date for valuing the condemned property is not dependent on whether the condemnor makes the deposit. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 263</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 149 (1982), decided under former G.S. 40-19.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Deposit of the amount of the award by the condemnor is discretionary.
   
   The condemnor has a right or election to pay the award; it does not require it to do so. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Irvin, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 263</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 149 (1982), decided under former G.S. 40-19.
   <br />
       </p>

        Judge has the discretionary power to allow withdrawal of a deposit
   
   in a condemnation proceeding without prejudice to the withdrawing party to continue further litigation. It is incumbent upon petitioner, if aggrieved by this order, to object and except thereto. Public Serv. Co. v. Lovin, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 709, 177 S.E.2d 448 (1970).

       <p>
        Condemnor May Not Take Voluntary Nonsuit after Obtaining Temporary Possession.
   
   - A condemnor may not, as a matter of right, take a voluntary nonsuit, over the landowner's objection, after obtaining temporary possession by payment of the amount of damages assessed by the commissioners, because the landowner may, if he elects to do so, assert his claim for damages on account of the condemnor's possession pendente lite. Topping v. State Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 291</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 502 (1959).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor After a Decree Has Been Made.
   
   - In proceedings by one railroad company to condemn a right-of-way upon which another has lawfully constructed its roadbed, the plaintiff may not, as a matter of right, submit to a judgment of nonsuit after a decree has been made, for rights which the defendant is entitled to have settled by the action have attached.

       </p>
       <p>
        Former Provision as to Registration Superseded.
   
   - Provision that a copy of the judgment in eminent domain proceedings be registered in the county where the land lies was superseded by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.047.html#t47a02s47-27" target="_blank">G.S. 47-27</a></cite>. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 319</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 531 (1947).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Pretrial Conference.
   
   - In a condemnation proceeding, the trial court should conduct a pretrial conference where the record shows that the parties have different concepts of what phase of the matter they were going to try. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">8 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 174 S.E.2d 839 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment Should Fix Boundaries.
   
   - In an action for damages for the location of a railroad, the judgment should definitely fix the land over which the road is located and the width of the right-of-way. Beal v. Durham &amp; C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 298</cite>, 48 S.E. 674 (1904).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Property Involved in Voluntary Sale as Guide to Value.
   
   - Whether property involved in a voluntary sale is sufficiently similar in nature, location, and condition to the property appropriated by condemnation to admit evidence of its sale and the price paid therefor as a guide to the value of the condemned property is a question to be determined by the trial judge, in the exercise of his sound discretion. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Denny Roll &amp; Panel Co., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 368</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 861 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Accrual of Interest.
   
   - Damages given in condemnation proceedings fall directly under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.024.html#t24a01s24-5" target="_blank">G.S. 24-5</a></cite>, giving interest only from the rendition of the judgment; hence, a judgment allowing interest from the date of condemnation would be erroneous. Durham v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 305</cite>, 88 S.E. 433 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        The judgment in an action must correspond with the verdict, and where, in condemnation proceedings tried in the superior court on appeal, the jury have in their verdict ascertained the damages to the owner of the land, the verdict will be presumed to include the element of interest, nothing else appearing; hence, it was reversible error for the trial judge to allow interest from the time the damages were determined upon by the appraisers and render judgment accordingly. Red Springs City Bd. of Educ. v. McMillan, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 485</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 895 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondents, in an action to take land under eminent domain, are entitled to interest from the date the petitioner acquires the right to possession and not from the date the proceedings were instituted. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Briggs, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 158</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 16 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Extent of Right Acquired with Railroad Easement.
   
   - A house situated on the right-of-way of a railroad at the time of condemnation proceedings does not become the absolute property of the company. Shields v. Norfolk &amp; C.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 1</cite>, 39 S.E. 582 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        A railroad company, by condemnation proceedings, acquires an easement upon the land condemned, with the right to actual possession of, so much only thereof as is necessary for the operation of its road and to protect it against contingent damages. Phillips v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 513</cite>, 41 S.E. 1022 (1902).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability for Costs Where Proceedings Not Carried Through.
   
   - In the event, for any reason, that condemnation proceedings are not carried through, all the costs of the proceeding, except the appraised value of the land, shall be paid by the petitioners. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co. v. Whiting Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 560</cite>, 184 S.E. 48 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Cessation of Right to Property Where Appraised Value Not Timely Paid.
   
   - After final judgment fixing petitioner's right to condemn, if the appraised value of the land is not paid within one year (now 60 days) the petitioner's right to take the property shall end, and the petitioner or claimant shall not be liable for the consideration, i.e., the value of the land. Nantahala Power &amp; Light Co. v. Whiting Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 560</cite>, 184 S.E. 48 (1936).

         II. EXCEPTIONS AND APPEALS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        General Exceptions to Order Appointing Commissioners.
   
   - Upon proper denial of the matters alleged in the petition, exceptions to the clerk's order appointing commissioners in condemnation proceedings may be of general character, and, upon appeal, will present any question appearing upon the record. Johnson City S.R.R. v. South &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 59</cite>, 61 S.E. 683 (1908).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Filing Exceptions to Commissioner's Report as Prerequisite to Filing of Appeal.
   
   - The respondents failed to make any exceptions to the Commissioner's report. They also failed to file exceptions to the clerk's final judgment. Therefore, respondents' appeal was properly dismissed. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Crowder, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 578, 366 S.E.2d 499 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Filing exceptions to a commissioner's report that establishes a statutory cartway and determines the compensation to be paid to the affected property owners is a prerequisite to appeal. Hancock v. Tenery, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 505 S.E.2d 315 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Existence of Case or Controversy.
        </b>
        - A case or controversy existed with respect to challenges by a nonprofit corporation and its political action committee to statutes that criminalize certain election activities, despite the State's claim that it did not interpret the statutes to reach the corporation's or committee's activities, since the statutes applied by their terms, thereby presenting a credible threat of prosecution and chilling the corporation's exercise of its free speech rights. Reyes v. Chex Sys., Inc., 168 F.3d 705 (4th Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1153, 120 S. Ct. 1156, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The landowner has the right to file exceptions to the report
   
   of the commissioners within 20 days after the report is filed. He is entitled to be heard upon his exceptions. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Filing of Exceptions Nunc Pro Tunc.
   
   - The judge has the discretionary power to allow exceptions to be filed nunc pro tunc. Gatling v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 66</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 131 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirement of Timely Exceptions to Preserve Right to Appeal.
   
   - Absent insufficient notice of proceedings before the clerk, an appealing party must file timely exceptions to the commissioners' report to preserve their right to appeal. City of Raleigh v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 297 S.E.2d 916 (1982), decided under former G.S. 40-19.

        Former G.S. 40-20 (now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa02s40A-29" target="_self">G.S. 40A-29</a></cite>), which guaranteed the right to have a jury determine the amount of damages, did not override the requirement of former G.S. 40-19 (now this section), that exceptions be filed within 20 days of the commissioners' report. City of Raleigh v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 297 S.E.2d 916 (1982), decided under former G.S. 40-19.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exceptions Held Timely.
   
   - In the absence of notice of the meeting of commissioners, the filing of exceptions by the landowner on the twenty-first day after the filing of the report was held timely. Gatling v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 66</cite>, 95 S.E.2d 131 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Clerk to Make Determination on Exceptions Only after Notice.
   
   - The clerk is to make his determination on the exceptions only after notice and an opportunity to be heard thereon is given the parties. Collins v. North Carolina State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 277</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 709 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from Ruling of Clerk.
   
   - It is only after the clerk of superior court confirms or fails to confirm the report of the commissioners that either party aggrieved by the ruling of the clerk may appeal; such appeal carries the entire record up for review by the trial judge upon the questions of fact. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1970).
   <br />

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Court on Erroneous Transfer from Clerk.
   
   - Where a proceeding to condemn property for urban renewal was erroneously transferred from the clerk to the superior court before the clerk acted on the exceptions to the commissioners' report, the judge of superior court had full power to consider and determine all matters in controversy as if the cause was originally before him. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 634</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 345 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        De Novo Trial on Appeal to Court.
   
   - On appeal to the superior court by both parties in proceedings to condemn land, the trial is de novo; and where the defendant has substantially recovered damages for the taking of his land, the costs are taxable against the plaintiff, though the recovery is in a smaller sum than the amount theretofore awarded by the appraisers or viewers. Durham v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. 305</cite>, 88 S.E. 433 (1916).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue as to amount of compensation is for determination de novo
   
   by jury trial in the superior court. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 250</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 65 (1967); Redevelopment Comm'n v. Denny Roll &amp; Panel Co., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 368</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 861 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of Review on Appeal.
   
   - The appeal from a judgment by the clerk of the superior court in condemnation proceedings takes the entire record up for review upon questions of fact to be tried by the court. Johnson City S.R.R. v. South &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">148 N.C. 59</cite>, 61 S.E. 683 (1908).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Stay of Entry Pending Appeal within Discretion of Trial Court.
   
   - Trial court in an eminent domain proceeding did not err in refusing to stay petitioner's entry upon the land pending appeal, where petitioner had deposited with the clerk the full amount of compensation awarded by the commissioners; though the trial court was empowered to stay petitioner's entry upon the land, it was not required to do so; it lies in the sound discretion of the trial court to determine whether a temporary restraining order should be granted. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Merritt, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 255 S.E.2d 225 (1979), decided under former G.S. 40-19.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The judge has authority to set aside the report and direct a new appraisement
   
   by the same commissioners or others appointed in their stead, on the ground that the damage assessed was excessive. Hanes v. North Carolina R.R., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 490</cite>, 13 S.E. 896 (1891).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Interlocutory Nature of Order Remanding Proceedings to Clerk.
   
   - An order of the superior court in condemnation proceedings remanding the cause to the clerk, that he may hear the same, is interlocutory, and no appeal lies therefrom. Cape Fear &amp; Y.V. Ry. v. King, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 454</cite>, 34 S.E. 541 (1899); Holly Shelter R.R. v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 132</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 136</cite>, 45 S.E. 549 (1903).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Vacation of Confirmation May Not Be Affirmed on Ground Additional Appraisals Will Not Give Recovery.
   
   - The court may not affirm the clerk's denial of a motion to vacate the judgment of confirmation on the ground that there is no reasonable probability that any additional appraisals, hearings, or trials would result in any recovery on the part of the defendant. Under the statutes, that is not for the court below or for the Supreme Court to determine, but can be determined only by commissioners who are appointed after notice and hearing contemplated. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Recordari Held Properly Denied.
   
   - The landowner must file exceptions to the final report of the commissioners within 20 days after the report is filed, with right to appeal to the superior court; hence, when landowner filed no exceptions and did not appeal from the order of confirmation by the clerk, recordari to the superior court was properly denied when the application therefor merely alleged merit without specifying facts supporting this conclusion and failed to negate laches, and the application was not made to the next succeeding term of the superior court. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Capehart, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 114</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 62 (1966).

      </p>
      <p>
       Strict Construction.
   
   - The exercise of the power of eminent domain is in derogation of common right, and all laws conferring such power must be strictly construed. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Abeyounis, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 161 S.E.2d 191 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A landowner is not entitled at the hearing before the clerk to a jury trial.
   
   Holly Shelter R.R. v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 132</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 136</cite>, 45 S.E. 549 (1903); Kaperonis v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 587</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 464 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Entitlement to Jury Trial on Appeal.
   
   - While prior to 1893, if the parties did not demand trial by jury before the appointment of the commissioners they were deemed to have waived it, and it would not be thereafter granted, now the right of trial by jury upon an appeal from the report of the commissioners is specifically granted. Chowan &amp; S.R.R. v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 246</cite>, 11 S.E. 328 (1890); Holly Shelter R.R. v. Newton, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 132</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 136</cite>, 45 S.E. 549 (1903); Durham v. Rigsbee, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 128</cite>, 53 S.E. 531 (1906).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of Owner to Jury Trial in Proceedings Instituted by Town.
   
   - In condemnation proceedings instituted by a town for the taking of lands for a public municipal purpose, the owner is entitled to a trial by jury in the superior court to determine his damages when he has duly preserved such right by his exceptions and proper procedure, and when the trial judge has exercised his discretion in setting aside the amount theretofore awarded by the viewers, the cause continues in the court for the jury trial given him by statute; and an order directing the appointment of other commissioners by the clerk to go upon the land and assess the damages is erroneous. Ayden v. Lancaster, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 297</cite>, 142 S.E. 18 (1928).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Requirement of Timely Exceptions to Preserve Right to Appeal.
   
   - Former G.S. 40-20 (now this section), which guaranteed the right to have a jury determine the amount of damages, did not override the requirement of former G.S. 40-19 (now <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa02s40A-28" target="_self">G.S. 40A-28</a></cite>), that exceptions be filed within 20 days of the commissioners' report. City of Raleigh v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 627, 297 S.E.2d 916 (1982), decided under former G.S. 40-20.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal Preserved Despite Absence of Specific Municipal Charter Provision Therefor.
   
   - Where a municipal charter provided for condemning lands of private owners for cemetery purposes in the manner prescribed for condemnation thereof for street or other purposes, without specific provisions for appeal, former G.S. 40-20 (now this section) nevertheless preserved the right of appeal, and the charter provisions would not be declared unconstitutional for failure to specially provide therefor. Long v. Rockingham, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 199</cite>, 121 S.E. 461 (1924).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to Jury Trial Limited.
   
   - There is a limitation on the right to demand trial by jury, and the idea that any such right is given in respect to the questions of the fact to be decided preliminary to the question of damages is clearly excluded.

       When either party to a condemnation proceeding appeals to the superior court in term and demands that the damage be determined by a jury, the trial must proceed in the superior court, insofar as the question of damages is concerned, as though no commissioners of appraisal had ever been appointed.

       Judgment Is Entered Upon the Jury's Verdict.
   
   - Upon appeal from the award of the appraisers in condemnation proceedings, the trial in the superior court is de novo, and must proceed, insofar as the question of damages is concerned, as though no commissioners of appraisal had ever been appointed; hence, the court properly enters judgment upon the verdict of the jury, regardless of whether it is greater or smaller than the award of the commissioners and regardless of which party took the appeal. Proctor v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 687</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 479 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       The superior court at term is vested with authority to enter judgment for the landowner for the amount of damages fixed by the verdict of the jury, regardless of whether the same be greater or smaller than the sum originally awarded by the commissioners of appraisal, and regardless of whether the landowner or the condemnor took the appeal.

       Property Involved in Voluntary Sale as Guide to Value.
   
   - Whether property involved in a voluntary sale is sufficiently similar in nature, location, and condition to the property appropriated by condemnation to admit evidence of its sale and the price paid therefor as a guide to the value of the condemned property is a question to be determined by the trial judge in the exercise of his sound discretion.

     <p>
      In case any property required by a condemnor shall be vested in any trustee not authorized to sell, release and convey the same, or in any infant, incompetent, or inebriate, the superior court shall have power, by a special proceeding, on petition, to authorize and empower such trustee or the general guardian or committee of such infant, incompetent or inebriate, to sell and convey the same to such condemnor, on such terms as may be just. In case any infant, incompetent or inebriate has no general guardian or committee, the court may appoint a special guardian or committee for the purpose of making a sale, release or conveyance, and may require security from the general or special guardian or committee as the court may deem proper. Before any conveyance or release authorized by this section shall be executed, the terms on which it is to be executed shall be reported to the court on oath. If the court is satisfied that the terms are just to the owner of the property, the court shall confirm the report and direct the proper conveyance or release to be executed, which shall have the same effect as if executed by an owner of the property having legal power to sell and convey the same.

      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Section.
   
   - Purpose of former G.S. 40-23 (similar to this section) is to prevent a corporation, having the right of eminent domain, from being indefinitely postponed in acquiring title and going on with its work or from being subjected to a succession of suits for compensation, and under its provisions, the company acquires the right-of-way and the court distributes the compensation. Abernathy v. South &amp; W.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 97</cite>, 63 S.E. 180 (1908).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase "adverse and conflicting claimants" does not include the condemnor.
   
   VEPCO v. King, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 219</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 318 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Who May Be "Adverse and Conflicting Claimants".
   
   - The phrase "adverse and conflicting claimants" is limited to those who assert adverse titles to the property and hence a conflict in interest as to the party entitled to the sum awarded, or those who are in agreement as to their respective titles but are in disagreement as to the value of their respective estates and hence the proportion of the award to which each is entitled. VEPCO v. King, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 219</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 318 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Mandatory Provision as to Manner of Determining Interests.
   
   - Former G.S. 40-23 (similar to this section) contained no mandatory provision as to when or in what manner the respective interests were to be determined. Barnes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 507</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 732 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Separation of Trial of Collateral Issues.
   
   - Ordinarily, the trial of collateral issues, involving a determination of what the respective claimants own, should be separate from the trial to determine the gross amount required to be paid. Barnes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 507</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 732 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Preservation of Right to Except to Order of Compulsory Reference.
   
   - The provision of former G.S. 40-23 (similar to this section) that the court "may in its discretion order a reference to ascertain the facts on which such determination and order are to be made" did not deprive any claimant of his right to except to an order of compulsory reference and preserve his right to a jury trial as to controverted issues of fact. Barnes v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 507</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 732 (1962).

      <p>
       Right to Jury Trial on Controverted Issues of Fact.
   
   - The provision of former G.S. 40-23 (similar to this section) that the court "may determine who is entitled to the same and direct to whom the same shall be paid" contemplated a situation where such determination may be made as a matter of law, and it did not deprive any claimant of his right to a jury trial as to controverted issues of fact.

       Public Purpose.
   
   - Because a sewer line connecting a landfill and to a public sewer system would be used by at least seven other users, and potentially 28 additional property owners, and because the county was not required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-40ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 40A-40(a)</a></cite> to give notice as to all the planned or potential users of the sewer line, the sewer line was properly found to be for a public purpose.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Long as Original Purpose Remains, No Fatal Inconsistency with Regard to Additional Uses.
   
   - Presuit notice of condemnation was sufficiently specific, where it stated the purpose of expanding and improving an existing landfill, even though the county's subsequent complaint stated additional uses, since the original purpose remained valid, and the county was not required to state with specificity the "uses" for which the property was taken.

      <p>
       Notice Requirement Satisfied.
   
   - Defendant's decision to estimate that no compensation was required did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights requiring just compensation because defendant adequately estimated that the benefit received by the project was sufficient compensation, and the issue of whether that was reasonable was more properly left for the condemnation hearing; defendant's estimate of no compensation adequately satisfied the notice requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-40" target="_self">G.S. 40A-40</a></cite>.

      <p>
       Defendant's notice, as provided to plaintiffs, was sufficient to meet the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-40" target="_self">G.S. 40A-40</a></cite> and otherwise did not prejudice plaintiffs due to their ability to file the current action and have a surveyor accurately locate the requested property; the notice properly cited to the statute regarding the condemnation procedure, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-42" target="_self">G.S. 40A-42</a></cite>, and defendant's description of the "easement area" was sufficient for plaintiffs to determine the requested property, or at least for a hired surveyor to locate.

      <p>
       Vesting of Title.
   
   - Under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-42ol1b1" target="_self">G.S. 40A-42(b)(1)</a></cite> and (2), title to the subject property did not vest in the State immediately upon serving the defendants with notice of the condemnation action. Condemnation of the subject property was for a purpose other than for the purposes listed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-42ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 40A-42(a)</a></cite>; thus, under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-42ol1b2" target="_self">G.S. 40A-42(b)(2)</a></cite>, title to the subject property vested with the State upon a failure of the owner to file an answer within the 120-day time period established by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-46" target="_self">G.S. 40A-46</a></cite>. City of Wilson Redevelopment Comm'n v. Boykin, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 667 S.E.2d 282 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (a) does not grant landowner a statutory right to bring an action for injunctive relief to bar condemnation proceeding
   
   and to prevent the title and the right to immediate possession of the property from vesting in defendant when under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-45" target="_self">G.S. 40A-45</a></cite> landowner has an adequate remedy of law. Tradewinds Campground, Inc. v. Town of Atlantic Beach, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 601, 369 S.E.2d 365, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 180</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 126 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Title of Defendants Holding Property as Tenants by Entirety Need Not Be Divested Simultaneously in Condemnation Proceeding.
   
   - Where plaintiff acquired title to defendants' interest in certain property owned by them as tenants by the entirety, and even though plaintiff argued such title on separate dates, this Chapter contains no requirement that title to condemned property be divested simultaneously. Town of Chapel Hill v. Burchette, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 157, 394 S.E.2d 698 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Answer Which Did Not Contest Plaintiff's Power to Condemn.
   
   - Where, in condemnation proceeding original answer of defendant property owner contested only amount of compensation due and did not contest power of plaintiff to condemn property, title to
   defendant's interest vested in plaintiff at that time, and plaintiff's filing of amended complaint did not void defendant's original answer. Town of Chapel Hill v. Burchette, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 157, 394 S.E.2d 698 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Failure to File Action for Injunctive Relief.
   
   - Title to condemned property vested and the county had the right to take immediate possession when they filed the complaint and deposited the estimated just compensation, since the landowners did not file an action for injunctive relief before the condemnation complaint was filed. Scotland County v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 765, 509 S.E.2d 213 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Landowner's Failure to Request Injunctive Relief at the Condemnation Hearing
   
   - Since the landowners had the opportunity to present all affirmative defenses argued in their action for a permanent injunction during the condemnation proceedings, judicial economy counseled against litigating the same issues again. Nelson v. Town of Highlands, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 583 S.E.2d 313 (2003).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Reasonable Diligence".
   
   - In an inverse condemnation suit where plaintiff's advertisement sign was torn down by defendant city, plaintiff's allegation in the complaint that defendant city failed to exercise reasonable diligence to discover plaintiff's interest and that plaintiff's sign was prominently constructed upon the property creates an issue of fact as to whether defendant city exercised reasonable diligence. Schloss Outdoor Adv. Co. v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 272 S.E.2d 920 (1980), decided under prior law.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Public Trust Doctrine Not Violated.
   
   - Defendant did not violate the public trust doctrine by asserting its rights of eminent domain as bequeathed to it by the State legislature because the State granted defendant the authority to assert its eminent domain powers over certain parts of plaintiffs' property for the purpose of the project. Fisher v. Town of Nags Head, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 725 S.E.2d 99 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice Requirement Satisfied.
   
   - Defendant's notice, as provided to plaintiffs, was sufficient to meet the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-40" target="_self">G.S. 40A-40</a></cite> and otherwise did not prejudice plaintiffs due to their ability to file the current action and have a surveyor accurately locate the requested property; the notice properly cited to the statute regarding the condemnation procedure, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-42" target="_self">G.S. 40A-42</a></cite>, and defendant's description of the "easement area" was sufficient for plaintiffs to determine the requested property, or at least for a hired surveyor to locate. Fisher v. Town of Nags Head, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 725 S.E.2d 99 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendant's decision to estimate that no compensation was required did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights requiring just compensation because defendant adequately estimated that the benefit received by the project was sufficient compensation, and the issue of whether that was reasonable was more properly left for the condemnation hearing; defendant's estimate of no compensation adequately satisfied the notice requirement of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-40" target="_self">G.S. 40A-40</a></cite>. Fisher v. Town of Nags Head, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 725 S.E.2d 99 (2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Impact Fees Not Authorized.
   
   - Public utility authority and a county were not authorized to assess sewer and water impact fees against developers because, inter alia, another entity provided such service to the developers and that entity's property was in actual use and needed to run the entity's business could not be condemned. Point South Props., LLC v. Cape Fear Pub. Util. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 508, 778 S.E.2d 284 (2015), overruled in part by Quality Built Homes Inc. v.

       Failure to File Answer Within 120 Days.
   
   - Trial court did not err in awarding final judgment for a county water and sewer district in its condemnation action against a landowner because the trial court's finding that the landowner did not file an answer within 120 days of service of the complaint pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-46" target="_self">G.S. 40A-46</a></cite> supported the conclusion of law that $ 12,000 was just compensation for the taking of the landowner's property.

R. Civ. P. 55(d), a trial court did not abuse its discretion by granting a condemnee's motion to set aside the entry of default against a second condemnee and deem the second condemnee's answer timely filed. The State was aware that the second condemnee had given the condemnee a power of attorney no later than October 2005, as evidenced by the fact that the State served notice of the condemnation and an amended answer on the second condemnee in care of the condemnee; the State nonetheless waited until the day of trial to seek entry of default against the second condemnee.

       Public Trust Rights.
   
   - It was error to grant a town judgment notwithstanding a verdict in a condemnation case on a theory that the public trust doctrine made the taking noncompensable because (1) the theory was not raised on directed verdict, (2) the sua sponte order was entered months after final judgment, and (3) the town was estopped from asserting the town possessed rights taken as the town's complaint said the town did not, the town did not raise the issue at an "all other issues" hearing, at which the town disavowed the public trust doctrine, the town did not immediately appeal a vital ruling that the town condemned the property, and landowners introduced a scintilla of supporting evidence.

       Expansion of sewer service constituted an action for the public use, and a city validly exercised its power of eminent domain to condemn a sewer easement over land because the easement area would be available to the public at large; using the eminent domain power to connect the city's property to the sewer pump station under the owner's property benefited the public because there was no sewer access on the city's property, and extending the sewer lines would allow the development of the land.

       Town's condemnation action was properly dismissed because property owners showed the action served no public benefit, as (1) the action would not "open" a street, since the street had not been closed, as access to the street was never blocked, and other portions of the street were not public, especially when the property was at the end of a dead-end street, (2) condemnation would not provide neighbors' access to land, utility service provider access, fire fighters' access to water, or general community interconnectedness, and (3) the evidence showed the town was motivated by considerations irrelevant to the public benefit.

The commissioners shall be sworn and shall go upon the land to appraise the compensation for the property taken and report their findings to the court within a time certain. Each commissioner shall be a person who has no right, title, or interest in or to the property being condemned, is not related within the third degree to the owner or to the spouse of the owner, is not an officer, employee, or agent of the condemnor, and is disinterested in the rights of the parties in every way.

Upon the receipt of such demand the action shall be placed on the civil issue docket of the superior court for trial de novo by a jury as to the issue of compensation, provided, that upon agreement of both parties trial by jury may be waived and the issue determined by the judge.

If no exception to the report of commissioners is filed within the time prescribed, final judgment shall be entered by the judge upon a determination and finding by him that the report of commissioners plus interest computed in accordance with G.S. 40A-53 of this Chapter, awards to the property owners just compensation. In the event that the judge is of the opinion and, in his discretion, determines that the award does not provide just compensation, he shall set aside the award and order the case placed on the civil issue docket for determination of the issue of compensation by a jury.

       Statute Is Remedial.

       An inverse condemnation remedy is now provided
   
   in this jurisdiction by this section. City of Winston-Salem v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 338 S.E.2d 794 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Inverse condemnation is simply a device to force a governmental body to exercise its power of condemnation,
   
   even though it may have no desire to do so. It allows a property owner to obtain compensation for a taking in fact, even though no formal exercise of the taking power has occurred. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Exhaustion Of Administrative Remedies.
   
   - Trial court properly concluded that property owners had no administrative remedies to exhaust before bringing their inverse condemnation claim against a public water authority because the owners were not required to intervene in the authority's applications for a North Carolina Environmental Management Commission (EMC) certificate or 404 permit since they were not challenging the authority's right to divert water from a river or construct a dam but were asking to be compensated as a result of the reduction of water flow; the EMC certificate only authorized the authority the right to exercise eminent domain by diverting the waters and did not concern the owners' right to compensation. L&amp;S Water Power, Inc. v. Piedmont Triad Reg'l Water Auth., <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 712 S.E.2d 146 (2011).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Constitutes a "Project" Under This Section.
   
   - Although defendant designated the entire widening of the road as a "project," where there was evidence that individual sections were also referred to as "projects," because the road was widened in sections by different contractors, and there were beginning and ending points to the widening of each section, these individual sections met the definition of "projects" for purposes of subsection (a). McAdoo v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 372 S.E.2d 742 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where plaintiffs sued for inverse condemnation by city whose road widening project was composed of many separate projects performed by more than one contractor, the plaintiffs had 24 months from the completion of the individual section of road encroaching upon their property which for purposes of subsection (a) was the "project" involving the taking. McAdoo v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 372 S.E.2d 742 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability of Subsection (c).
   
   - Although subsection (c) provides that "nothing in this action shall in any manner affect an owner's common-law right to bring an action in tort for damage to his property," it was not relevant in an inverse condemnation case, since an owner has no common-law right to bring a trespass action against a city. McAdoo v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 372 S.E.2d 742 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Property Taken for Public Use.
   
   - Decision to provide a claimant whose property has been taken for a public purpose with a statutory inverse condemnation remedy while depriving a claimant who has suffered the same injury for a non-public purpose of the right to utilize that statutory remedy seems inconsistent with the likely legislative intent; a number of relevant canons of statutory construction provide support for the manner in which the supreme court believes the "plain meaning" of subsection (a) should be understood. Wilkie v. City of Boiling Spring Lakes, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 540</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 853 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although a condemning entity must establish that a proposed taking will further a public purpose before a condemnation can be authorized, there is no reason why a reciprocal burden to establish the existence of a public purpose should be imposed upon a property owner who has been deprived of his or her property by governmental action taken for a non-public purpose. Wilkie v. City of Boiling Spring Lakes, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 540</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 853 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of appeals erred in reversing an order determining that a city's actions resulted in a taking of the owners' property without just compensation because it improperly held that there could be no inverse condemnation when property was not taken for a public use. Wilkie v. City of Boiling Spring Lakes, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 540</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 853 (2018).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Defendants' assertion of a counterclaim in condemnation action by city,
   
   alleging that property not included therein had been taken, properly placed the inverse condemnation issue before the court. City of Winston-Salem v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 338 S.E.2d 794 (1986).
   <br />

       Remedy for Municipal Airport Overflight.
   
   - Private landowners no longer have any private common-law actions for damages in trespass or nuisance in municipal airport overflight cases; their sole remedy is inverse condemnation. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section provided the sole procedure by which plaintiffs could bring an inverse condemnation action involving a taking occurring as a result of the construction and operation of an airport runway. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No simple test exists for determining when a taking occurs by aircraft overflights;
   
   rather, a particularized judgment of the facts of the individual case is necessary. Thus the date requirement of this section does not impose any stringent standard of specificity. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plaintiffs' allegation of a very general taking by aircraft overflights "within the past two years"
   
   failed to allege with reasonable specificity when the alleged appropriation or taking occurred; however, rather than dismissing the complaint altogether, the court should have required plaintiffs to come forward in accordance with defendant's motion for a more definite statement and plead the facts which they possessed, so that the court could then rule on their timeliness and sufficiency. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The statutory time begins to run on completion of the project or the taking,
   
   whichever is later. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       The individual section of widened roadway, which constituted the taking by inverse condemnation of plaintiff's property, was not completed until the maintenance period was completed; the statutory period runs from the completion of the "project," which does not necessarily mean it runs from the completion of construction. McAdoo v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 570, 372 S.E.2d 742 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Cause of Action Time Barred.
   
   - Billboard owner's cause of action based on an alleged regulatory taking accomplished by enactment of zoning ordinance arose on April 15, 1985, the date the zoning ordinance at issue was enacted and not April 15, 1992, the end of the amortization period when the signs were required to be removed; plaintiff who did not file suit until May 11, 1992, over seven years after the enactment of the zoning ordinance at issue, was barred. Naegele Outdoor Adv., Inc. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 349</cite>, 457 S.E.2d 874 (1995).

      <p>
       Limitation Period for Taking Occurring Prior to Enactment of Chapter.
   
   - Where plaintiffs' action involving a taking incident to construction of an airport runway accrued in June 1979, and over two years later, in July 1981, new <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.040A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 40A</a></cite> was enacted, the period between such enactment and the cutoff date under the new limitation, five months and three weeks (July 10, 1981 to January 1, 1982) was not itself so unreasonably short as to deny plaintiffs due process of law, particularly in light of the fact that plaintiffs lived in an area where large numbers of inverse condemnation actions were filed within the statutory period. Smith v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 339 S.E.2d 844 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipality is solely liable for the damages that inevitably or necessarily flow
   
   from the construction of an improvement in keeping with the design of the condemnor, and contract provisions which require that work be accomplished upon public property or upon private property for which the city holds an easement do not alter the city's liability for such damages. City of Winston-Salem v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 338 S.E.2d 794 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Damages to land outside city's easements
   
   which inevitably or necessarily flow from the construction of the outfall result in an appropriation of land for public use. Such damages are embraced within the just compensation to which defendant landowners are entitled. City of Winston-Salem v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 338 S.E.2d 794 (1986).

        Migration of Cases from City Landfill.
       </b>
       - Because this section, the inverse condemnation provision, provides a landowner's only remedy for alleged damage in the nature of a "taking," the court granted summary judgment as to multi-family apartment complex developer's state, common-law claims for nuisance, trespass, and negligence based on migration of methane gases from city landfill.

   - Inverse condemnation statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-51" target="_self">G.S. 40A-51</a></cite>, did not apply to preempt property owner's negligence claim for damage to her property allegedly caused by the municipality's failure to adequately maintain a storm drainage pipe running under her property, as <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-51" target="_self">G.S. 40A-51</a></cite>(c) specifically stated that nothing under the statutory section would affect a property owner's common-law right to bring an action in tort for damage to property.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary Judgment Proper.
   
   - Even if the trial court had considered a property owner's affidavits, summary judgment for a public utility authority on his counterclaims for inverse condemnation and trespass would have been proper, and he had failed to comply with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-51" target="_self">G.S. 40A-51</a></cite>; because the exclusive remedy for failure to compensate for a taking was inverse condemnation under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa03s40A-51" target="_self">G.S. 40A-51</a></cite>, he had no common-law right to bring a trespass action against the authority, and there was no right to a jury trial on the issue of a taking under G.S. 40A-51. Cape Fear Pub. Util. Auth. v. Costa, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 697 S.E.2d 338 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a city on property owners' inverse-condemnation claims because a single instance of temporary flooding of the owners' properties without the possibility of recurrence did not constitute a taking for purposes of an inverse-condemnation claim; it could not be said the city's installation of water pipes was intended to flood the owners' properties or that the flooding was a foreseeable direct or natural result at the time of the pipes' installation.

       Taking Not Found.
   
   - When a city paid consideration for a sewer line easement to plaintiffs' predecessor in title, and later abandoned the easement and left a sewer pipe in the ground in question, this did not amount to a taking.

       Denial of Jury Trial on Issue of Ownership Upheld.
   
   - In special proceedings for condemnation of land for an airport, trial judge did not err in denying motion for a jury trial on the issue of ownership of the property, as the issue of ownership was not triable by a jury of right, and moreover, appellant did not demand a trial by jury in writing within the prescribed time.

      <p>
       Right of Eminent Domain Subject to Provision for Reasonable Compensation.
   
   - The qualification of the right of eminent domain, that compensation should be made for private property taken for public use, is founded on justice and a due regard for basic property rights, and is applied in North Carolina. Bennett v. Winston-Salem Southbound R.R., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 389</cite>, 87 S.E. 133 (1915). See also, Johnston v. Rankin, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 550</cite> (1874); Phillips v. Postal Tel. Cable Co., <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 513</cite>, 41 S.E. 1022, rev'd on other grounds on rehearing, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 225</cite>, 42 S.E. 587 (1902).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to exercise the power of eminent domain is always subject to the principle that there must be definite and adequate provision made for reasonable compensation to the owner of the property proposed to be taken. Town of Mount Olive v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 259</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 525 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty of Condemnor to Pay Just Compensation.
   
   - When the right of condemnation is exercised, a duty is imposed on the condemnor to pay just compensation for the property taken. VEPCO v. King, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 219</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 318 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of Owner to Full and Ample Compensation.
   
   - A citizen must surrender his private property in obedience to the necessities of a growing and progressive state, but in doing so he is entitled to be paid full, fair and ample compensation, to be reduced only by such benefits as are special and peculiar to his land. He has the right to have and enjoy the general benefits which are common to him and to his neighbors, without being required to pay therefor merely because it so happens that the use of his land is necessary for the needs of the public. Stamey v. Burnsville, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 39</cite>, 126 S.E. 103 (1925).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Noncompensable Business Losses of Lessee.
   
   - Where an entire leasehold estate is taken in the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the lessee is not entitled to recover compensation for the incidental loss attributable to the costs of removing his stock of merchandise, fixtures and other personal property, the interruption or loss of business, or the loss of customers or good will, incident to the necessity of moving to a new location, since such losses are not property and are noncompensable. Williams v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 141</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 263 (1960); Zourzoukis v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 149</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 269 (1960).

       Real Property Valuations for Ad Valorem Purposes Admissible.
   
   - Evidence of real property valuations made by the county for ad valorem tax purposes are admissible against the county, in an eminent domain proceeding, as an admission of a party opponent.

      <p>
       Measure of Damages.
   
   - The measure of damages or just compensation to be paid to the landowner is the difference in the fair market value of the land immediately before the taking and the fair market value immediately after the taking of the easement. Duke Power Co. v. Ribet, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 87, 212 S.E.2d 182 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Valuation of Land as of Date of Taking.
   
   - For the purpose of determining the sum to be paid as compensation for land taken under the right of eminent domain, the value of the land taken should be ascertained as of the date of the taking, which is when the proceeding is begun. City of Kings Mountain v. Goforth, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 316</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 231 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining the fair market value of property taken in condemnation, it is generally regarded as competent to show the value of the property within a reasonable time before and/or after the taking as bearing upon its value at the time of the appropriation. Craven County v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 256, 360 S.E.2d 479 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 471</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 919 (1988).

       Price of Reconveyed Property.
   
   - Section 136-19, when read consistently with this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa04s40A-65" target="_self">G.S. 40A-65</a></cite>, as well as with the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Const., dictates that the State not profit from overreaching seizures by eminent domain; therefore, Department of Transportation (DOT) was required to reconvey property acquired by eminent domain but unused by the DOT to the assigns of the original owner at the original purchase price, plus interest at the legal rate compounded annually. Ferrell v. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 42, 407 S.E.2d 601 (1991), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 650</cite>, 435 S.E.2d 309 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporation damaging adjacent property while constructing a railroad is liable in damages

      <p>
       Right to Cut Trees Cannot Be Taken without Compensation.
   
   - Where the right to cut trees was not acquired when right-of-way was condemned, and was not paid for in the first proceeding, the right could not in a subsequent proceeding be taken without compensation. Weyerhaeuser Co. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 717</cite>, 127 S.E.2d 539 (1962).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Compensation for the right to cut trees should be made in a lump sum

      <p>
       Owner Held Entitled to Compensatory Damages.
   
   - Landowner was entitled to compensatory damages for the cutting of crossties on land not included in the right-of-way, and the negligent filling of ditches instead of building bridges over them in constructing the roads necessary to remove the timber, and for breaking down fences. Waters v. Greenleaf-Johnson Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 648</cite>, 20 S.E. 718 (1894).

       Landowner's Son Competent to Give Opinion of Land Value.
   
   - The son of a landowner who had exhibited a great deal of familiarity with the property, as well as neighboring properties, and was familiar with the value of these properties was competent to give an opinion as to the land value. Craven County v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 256, 360 S.E.2d 479 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 471</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 919 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The sales prices of voluntary sales of property
   
   similar in nature, location, and condition to the land being condemned is admissible as evidence of the value of that land if the other sales are not too remote in time. Whether the properties are sufficiently similar to admit such evidence is a question to be determined by the trial judge in his sound discretion, usually after a hearing on the issue conducted out of the presence of the jury. City of Winston-Salem v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 702</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 366 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of Comparable Sales of Farmland.
   
   - Where farmland is condemned as an easement, it is not error to exclude evidence of comparable sales nearby if there is a large difference in the size of the tracts, despite little difference in zoning and water availability. Duke Power Co. v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 282 S.E.2d 564 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>

       Agreement to Furnish Fire Protection as Compensation.
   
   - A municipality has the authority to compensate landowners for a water and sewer line easement across a tract of land located outside the municipal limits by an agreement to furnish fire protection for any buildings located on such tract, and such agreement does not constitute a waiver of the municipality's governmental immunity with respect to torts committed in the maintenance or operation of its fire department.

       Testimony Regarding the Separate Valuation for Timber.
   
   - The court refused to adopt the "unit rule" of valuation and held that testimony regarding the separate valuation for timber found on condemned property was properly admitted into evidence; "preventing an appraiser witness from disclosing [information regarding enhancing components] seems to be at odds with the practice of real estate appraisal, and prevents an accurate reflection for the jury of the fair market value of the condemned property."

   - Section 136-112(1) violates the equal protection rights of the property owners who have part of a tract of land condemned for highway purposes because they are denied the just compensation received by other property owners also subjected to condemnation proceedings.

       Owner Not Entitled To Additional Compensation.
   
   - Owner was not entitled to additional compensation, beyond the diminution in value as provided in the statute, based on the loss of the right to develop property in a certain way; therefore, where a town filed a complaint that would entitle the owner to compensation based on the diminution in value of the property caused by the taking of an easement, the owner could not maintain an inverse condemnation action seeking additional damages resulting in the loss of its vested rights.

       Property Valuation.
   
   - Trial court did not err in ruling for a county in its suit against a lessee to condemn its leasehold interest in mall property because the county had the right to terminate the lease pursuant to the lease; scope of the project rule in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa04s40A-65ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 40A-65(a)</a></cite> operated to require that the property be valued as retail space, rather than government office space, which was the use intended by the county, and the lessee's attempt to extend the application of the rule to strike a provision from a contract that it negotiated, to which it agreed, and which it signed, was beyond the parameters of the scope of the project rule.

       Evidence of Highest and Best Use as If Not Under "Cloud of Condemnation" Was Proper.
   
   - In a condemnation action by an airport authority, the testimony of the condemnee's expert witness as to the property's highest and best use as if it had not been under a "cloud of condemnation" was proper. Since a property owner cannot capitalize on any increase in the property's value due to the reasonable likelihood that it will be acquired, the condemnor likewise cannot take advantage of any resulting decrease in the property due to the threat of condemnation.

       Effect of Municipal Ordinance.
   
   - Fact that the value of condemned property was decreased by an ordinance passed by an entity that was different from the entity that sought to condemn the property did not preclude the application of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t40Aa04s40A-65" target="_self">G.S. 40A-65</a></cite>, preventing the use of the decreased value as the property's value for condemnation purposes, where the ordinance decreasing the property's value was caused by the purpose for which the property was condemned. Piedmont Triad Reg'l Water Auth. v. Unger, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 572 S.E.2d 832 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 165</cite>, 580 S.E.2d 695 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       When landowners asserted that a decrease in the value of their property, due its inclusion in a "no-development" zone, pursuant to a county ordinance, was caused by the water development project for which the property was condemned by a water authority, the landowners were not collaterally attacking the ordinance. Piedmont Triad Reg'l Water Auth. v. Unger, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 572 S.E.2d 832 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 165</cite>, 580 S.E.2d 695 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the value of landowners' property was decreased by its inclusion in a "no-development" zone created pursuant to a county ordinance to protect the watershed for a proposed reservoir, and the water authority subsequently sought to condemn the property, the ordinance causing a decrease in the property's value resulted from the reservoir project; thus, the landowners could introduce evidence of the value of the property before the ordinance was enacted, in the condemnation proceeding.

       Trial court did not err in finding and concluding that there was no unity of ownership between a property owner's tracts and the tract owned by a separate limited liability company (LLC) because the owner, individually, had no interest in the tract owned by the LLC, but rather, he merely owned an interest in the LLC that which owned the tract.

Unless the public condemnor acquired the entire lot, block, or tract of land belonging to the original owner, the original owner must own the remainder of the original lot, block, or tract of land from which the property was acquired to purchase the property pursuant to this section. The public condemnor shall specify a date by which the property must be reconveyed and the payment made, which may not be less than 30 days after written notification to the original owner that the public condemnor has decided to offer the return of the property.
