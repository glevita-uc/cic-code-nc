            What Plaintiff Must Show. - To prevail under the State Fair Housing Act, plaintiff must show that defendant refused to engage in a real estate transaction with plaintiff due to the plaintiff 's race, color, religion, sex or national origin. North Carolina
            Human Relations Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty Co., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766 (1986).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            In order for this Act to apply, the discriminatory housing practice must first: (1) occur in a "real estate transaction", and (2) discriminate "because of" one of the reasons listed in this section. Town of Newton Grove v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite>            376, 432 S.E.2d 441, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 181</cite>, 438 S.E.2d 208 (1993).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the Act, race, color, religion, sex or national origin must be more than a mere factor in a defendant's decision not to engage in a real estate transaction. North Carolina Human Relations Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty Co.,
            <cite
                class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766 (1986).
                <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Statistics describing the disparate impact of practices or policies may be circumstantial evidence of prohibited biased conduct. However, if the finder of fact reasonably finds that a particular housing practice or policy is not motivated by considerations
            of race, color, religion, sex or national origin, then the particular housing practice or policy is not a violation of the State Fair Housing Act, no matter how "disparate" the impact of the practice or policy. North Carolina Human Relations
            Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty Co., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766 (1986).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Family Composition Rules in Apartment Complex. - In a proceeding under the State Fair Housing Act, plaintiff could meet her burden of proof by showing that the facially neutral family composition rules used to deny her application to rent an apartment
            were promulgated to discriminate against blacks; she could also meet her burden of proof by showing that she could have leased the apartment if she were of another race. North Carolina Human Relations Council ex rel. Leach v. Weaver Realty
            Co., <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 340 S.E.2d 766 (1986).
            <br />
        </p>
        <p>
            Defendants failed to meet the threshold question of showing that plaintiff did not allow defendants to place a mobile home on the property "because of" defendant's handicapping condition. Town of Newton Grove v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite>            376, 432 S.E.2d 441, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 181</cite>, 438 S.E.2d 208 (1993).

            Housing satisfies the requirements of subdivisions (2) and (3) of this subsection even though there are units occupied by employees of the housing facility who are under the minimum age or family members of the employees residing in the same unit who
            are under the minimum age, provided the employees perform substantial duties directly related to the management of the housing.

                Any person who claims to have been injured by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice or who reasonably believes that he will be irrevocably injured by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice may file a complaint with the North Carolina Human
                Relations Commission. A fair housing enforcement organization, as defined in regulations adopted under 42 U.S.C. § 3602 (1968), may file a complaint with the Commission on behalf of a person who claims to have been injured by or reasonably
                believes he will be irrevocably injured by an unlawful discriminatory housing practice. Complaints shall be in writing, shall state the facts upon which the allegation of an unlawful discriminatory housing practice is based, and shall
                contain such other information and be in such form as the Commission requires. Commission employees shall assist complainants in reducing complaints to writing and shall assist in setting forth the information in the complaint as may be
                required by the Commission. Within 10 days after receipt of the complaint, the Director of the Commission shall serve on the respondent a copy of the complaint and a notice advising the respondent of his procedural rights and obligations
                under this Chapter. Within 10 days after receipt of the complaint, the Director of the Commission shall serve on the complainant a notice acknowledging the filing of the complaint and informing the complainant of his time limits and choice
                of forums under this Chapter.

            <li id="t41As41A-7ol1b">
                A complaint under subsection (a) shall be filed within one year after the alleged unlawful discriminatory housing practice occurred. A respondent may file an answer to the complaint against him within 10 days after receiving a copy of the complaint. With
                the leave of the Commission, which shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, the complaint and the answer may be amended at any time. Complaints and answers shall be verified. The Commission shall make final administrative
                disposition of a complaint within one year of the date the complaint is filed, unless it is impracticable to do so. If the Commission is unable to do so, it shall notify the complainant and respondent, in writing, of the reasons for not
                doing so.

                Whenever another agency of the State or any other unit of government of the State has jurisdiction over the subject matter of any complaint filed under this section, and such agency or unit of government has legal authority equivalent to or greater than
                the authority under this Chapter to investigate or act upon the complaint, the Commission shall be divested of jurisdiction over such complaint. The Commission shall, within 30 days, notify the agency or unit of government of the apparent
                unlawful discriminatory housing practice, and request that the complaint be investigated in accordance with such authority.

                Complaints may be resolved at any time by informal conference, conciliation, or persuasion. Nothing said or done in the course of such informal procedure may be made public by the Commission or used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding under this Chapter
                without the written consent of the person concerned.

            <li id="t41As41A-7ol1e">
                Within 30 days after the filing of the complaint, the Commission shall commence an investigation of the complaint to ascertain the facts relating to the alleged unlawful discriminatory housing practice. If the complaint is not resolved before the investigation
                is complete, upon completion of the investigation, the Commission shall determine whether or not there are reasonable grounds to believe that an unlawful discriminatory housing practice has occurred. The Commission shall make a determination
                within 90 days after the filing of the complaint. If the Commission is unable to complete the investigation and issue a determination within 90 days after the filing of the complaint, the Commission shall notify the complainant and respondent
                in writing of the reasons for not doing so. If the Commission concludes at any time following the filing of a complaint under this section that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Chapter, the Commission
                may commence a civil action for, and the court may grant, appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint. Any temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary or temporary relief shall
                be issued in accordance with G.S. 1A-1, et seq., Rules of Civil Procedure. The commencement of a civil action under this subsection does not affect the continuation of the Commission's investigation or the initiation of a separate civil
                action pursuant to other subsections of this section.
