      For the purpose of enabling all persons owning real estate within this State to have the title thereto settled and registered, as prescribed by the provisions of this Chapter, the superior court of the county in which the land lies in the State shall have exclusive original jurisdiction of all petitions and proceedings had thereupon, under the rules of practice and procedure prescribed for special proceedings except as herein otherwise provided.

      <p>
       Chapter to Be Liberally Construed.
   
   - This statute is of a remedial character, and should be liberally construed according to its intent. Cape Lookout Co. v. Gold, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 63</cite>, 83 S.E. 3 (1914); Dillon v. Brocker, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 65</cite>, 100 S.E. 191 (1919); Perry v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 377</cite>, 14 S.E.2d 46 (1941).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Torrens Act manifests a purpose on the part of the General Assembly
   
   to establish a title in the registered owner, impregnable against attack at the time of the decree, and also to protect him against all claims or demands not noted on the book for the registration of titles, and to make that book a complete record and the only conclusive evidence of the title. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The basic principle of this system
   
   is the registration of the official and conclusive evidence of the title of land, instead of registering, as the old system requires, the wholly private and inconclusive evidences of such title. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principle of the "Torrens System" is conveyance by registration and certificate instead of by deed, and assimilates the transfer of land to the transfer of stocks in corporations. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The purpose of a proceeding under the Torrens Law
       </b>
       is to remove clouds from title and resolve controversies with regard thereto, not to validate title to lands which under the law of the State, which everyone is presumed to know, are not subject to private ownership. Swan Island Club, Inc. v. Yarbrough, 209 F.2d 698 (4th Cir. 1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       The general purpose of the Torrens System is to secure by a decree of court, or other similar proceedings, a title impregnable against attack; to make a permanent and complete record of the exact status of the title, with the certificate of registration showing at a glance all liens, encumbrances, and claims against the title; and to protect the registered owner against all claims or demands not noted on the book for the registration of titles. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The judge of the superior court is given authority over the whole proceedings
   
   before the clerk, and may require reformation of the process, pleadings or decrees or entries, and therefore he has authority to allow parties defendant to be made and to enlarge the time within which answers may be filed. Empire Mfg. Co. v. Spruill, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 618</cite>, 86 S.E. 522 (1915).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Registered land is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts,
   
   except as otherwise specially provided in this Chapter, in the same manner as if not so registered. Harrison v. Darden, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 364</cite>, 26 S.E.2d 860 (1943).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Determining Value of Improvements.
   
   - There is nothing in this Chapter, known as the Torrens Law, which prevents the courts from proceeding to determine the value of improvements claimed by defendants who have been evicted under plaintiff's superior title, in accordance with the terms of an unassailed judgment to which plaintiff was a party, and ascertained by a consent reference. Harrison v. Darden, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 364</cite>, 26 S.E.2d 860 (1943).

       <b>
        Court Has No Jurisdiction to Render Judgment Affecting Title to Lands Under Navigable Waters.
       </b>
       - In a Torrens proceeding the court is without jurisdiction to render any judgment affecting title to land covered by navigable waters, and with respect to such lands such a decree is a nullity, and is subject to collateral attack, although it may be valid with respect to other lands therein embraced. Swan Island Club, Inc. v. Yarbrough, 209 F.2d 698 (4th Cir. 1954).

     <p>
      In every proceeding to register title, in which it is alleged in the petition or made to appear that the land therein described, whether in one or more parcels, is situated partly in one county and partly in another, or is situated in two or more counties, that is to say, when an entire tract, or two or more entire tracts, are situated in two or more counties (but not separate or several tracts in different counties) it shall be competent to institute the proceedings before the clerk of the superior court of any county in which any part of such tract lying in two or more counties is situated, and said clerk shall have jurisdiction both of the parties and of the subject matter as fully as if said land was situated wholly in his county; but upon the entry of a final decree of registration of title, the clerk by or before whom the same was rendered shall certify a copy thereof to the register of deeds of every county in which said land or any part thereof is situated, and the same shall be there filed and recorded; and every such register of deeds, upon demand of the person entitled and payment of requisite fees therefor, shall issue and deliver a certificate of title for that part of said land situated in his county. This section shall apply and become effective in all cases or proceedings heretofore conducted before any clerk of the superior court of this State for registration of title, as in this Chapter authorized, when the land described in the petition as an entire tract was situated in two or more counties, as aforesaid; and upon the filing and recording of a certified copy of the final decree or decree of registration therein, the register of deeds shall issue and deliver a certificate of title to the present owner or person entitled to the same, for that part of the land situated in his county, as aforesaid, upon payment or tender of proper fees therefor.

       Attack on Proceedings Because Clerk Did Not Sign Jurat.
   
   - Where petitioner seeking to have his title to land registered under the provisions of the Torrens Law signed an oath reciting that he had been duly sworn, he could not contend that the oath lacked validity on grounds that the clerk of the court had not signed the jurat, and that in consequence the proceedings which followed were absolutely void, and thereafter, upon his own motion, have such proceedings set aside.

       § 43-10. Notice of petition published.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In addition to the summons issued, prescribed in the foregoing section [§ 43-9], the clerk of the court shall, at the time of issuing such summons, publish a notice of the filing thereof containing the names of the petitioners, the names of all persons named in the petition, together with a short but accurate description of the land and the relief demanded, in some secular newspaper published in the county wherein the land is situate, and having general circulation in the county; and if there be no such paper, then in a newspaper in the county nearest thereto and having general circulation in the county wherein the land lies, once a week for eight issues of such paper. The notice shall set forth the title of the cause and in legible or conspicuous type the words "To whom it may concern," and shall give notice to all persons of the relief demanded and the return day of the summons: Provided, that no final order or judgment shall be entered in the cause until there is proof and adjudication of publication as in other cases of publication of notice of summons. The provisions of this section, in respect to the issuing and service of summons and the publication of the notice, shall be mandatory and essential to the jurisdiction of the court to proceed in the cause: Provided, that the recital of the service of summons and publication in the decree or in the final judgment in the cause, and in the certificate issued to the petitioner as hereinafter provided, shall be conclusive evidence thereof. The clerk of the court shall also record a copy of said notice in the lis pendens docket of his office and cross-index same as other notices of lis pendens and shall also certify a copy thereof to the superior court of each county in which any part of said land lies, and the clerk thereof shall record and cross-index same in the lis pendens records of his office as other notices of lis pendens are recorded and cross-indexed.

       Sufficiency of Short Form of Description.
   
   - Where notice is required to contain a short form of description of the property, it is sufficient if it clearly calls the attention of adjoining owners or others who might be interested to the particular property intended, and it need not contain all the elements of a full description. Richmond Cedar Works v. Farmers Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 254 S.E.2d 673 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reference to County Public Registry for Description Held Insufficient.
   
   - Where a notice published in a county newspaper under this section simply stated where in the county public registry a description of the land in question could be found, the notice by publication was inadequate to give the notice required by statute. Richmond Cedar Works v. Farmers Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 254 S.E.2d 673 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sufficiency of Publication.
   
   - Where the summons in proceedings to register lands has been issued and served under the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a03s43-9" target="_self">G.S. 43-9</a></cite>, it is not necessary to the validity of the proceedings that the publication of notice of filing should have been made on exactly the day the summons was issued, if the publication has been made in the designated paper once a week for eight successive weeks as directed by this section. Cape Lookout Co. v. Gold, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 63</cite>, 83 S.E. 3 (1914).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusive Evidence of Publication.
   
   - The recital in a final Torrens decree of registration that "publication of notice has been duly made" is conclusive evidence of the fact, and any attack on the decree is foreclosed by the limitation imposed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a05s43-26" target="_self">G.S. 43-26</a></cite>. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       When viewed in light of the purpose of the Torrens Act, it is clear that the proviso that recital of service of summons and publication in the decree and the certificate shall be conclusive evidence thereof is intended to cure any jurisdictional defect with respect to issuance and service of summons and the publication of notice so as to foreclose all jurisdictional attacks on a Torrens title. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 126</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 371 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver of Objection to Publication.
   
   - In proceedings to register a title to lands, a party claiming an interest in the lands waives his right to object on the grounds of irregularity in the publication of notice by appearing and answering the petition.

If any person claiming an interest in the land described in the petition, or any lien thereon, shall file an answer, the petition and answer, together with all exhibits filed, shall be referred to the examiner of titles, who shall proceed, after notice to the petitioner and the persons who have filed answer or answered, to hear the cause upon such parol or documentary evidence as may be offered or called for and taken by him, and in addition thereto make such independent examination of the title as may be necessary.

If, upon consideration of such record, or the record and verdict of issues to be certified and tried by jury, the title be found in the petitioner, the judge shall enter a decree to that effect, ascertaining all limitations, liens, etc., declaring the land entitled to registration accordingly, and the same, together with the record, shall be docketed by the clerk of the court as in other cases, and a copy of the decree certified to the register of deeds of the county for registration as hereinafter provided.

If, upon the return day of the summons and the day upon which the petition is set down for hearing, no answer be filed, the clerk shall refer the same to the examiner of titles, who shall, after notice to the petitioner, proceed to examine the title, together with all liens or encumbrances set forth or referred to in the petition and exhibits, and shall examine the registry of deeds, mortgages, wills, judgments, mechanic liens and other records of the county, and upon such examination he shall, as hereinbefore provided, report to the clerk the condition of the title, with a notice of liens or encumbrances thereon. The examiner shall have power to take and call for evidence in such case as fully as if the application were being contested. If the title shall be found to be in the petitioner, the clerk shall enter a decree to that effect and declaring the land entitled to registration, with entry of any limitations, liens, etc., and shall certify the same for registration, as hereinbefore provided, after approval by the judge of the superior court.

       § 43-17.1. Issuance of certificate upon death of registered owner; petition and contents; dissolution of corporation; certificate lost or not received by grantee.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon the death of any person who is the registered owner of any estate or interest in land which has been brought under this Chapter, a petition may be filed with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the title to such land is registered by anyone having any estate or interest in the land, or any part thereof, the title to which has been registered under the terms of this Chapter, attaching thereto the registered certificate of title issued to the deceased holder and setting forth the nature and character of the interest or estate of such petitioner in said land, the manner in which such interest or estate was acquired by the petitioner from the deceased person - whether by descent, by will, or otherwise, and setting forth the names and addresses of any and all other persons, firms or corporations which may have any interest or estate therein, or any part thereof, and the names and addresses of all persons known to have any claims or liens against the said land; and setting forth the changes which are necessary to be made in the registered certificate of title to land in order to show the true owner or owners thereof occasioned by the death of the registered owner of said certificate. Such petition shall contain all such other information as is necessary to fully inform the court as to the status of the title and the condition as to all liens and encumbrances against said land existing at the time the petition is filed, and shall contain a prayer for such relief as the petitioner may be entitled to under the provisions hereof. Such petition shall be duly verified.
     </p>
     <p>
      Like procedure may be followed as herein set forth upon the dissolution of any corporation which is the registered owner of any estate or interest in the land which has been brought under this Chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event the registered certificate of title has been lost and after due diligence cannot be found, and this fact is made to appear by allegation in the petition, such registered certificate of title need not be attached to the petition as hereinabove required, but the legal representatives of the deceased registered owner shall be made parties to the proceeding. If such persons are unknown or, if known cannot after due diligence be found within the State, service of summons upon them may be made by publication of the notice prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a04s43-17.2" target="_self">G.S. 43-17.2</a></cite>. In case the registered owner is a corporation which has been dissolved, service of summons upon such corporation and any others who may have or claim any interest in such land thereunder shall be made by publication of the notice containing appropriate recitals as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a04s43-17.2" target="_self">G.S. 43-17.2</a></cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      If any registered owner has by writing conveyed or attempted to convey a title to any registered land without the surrender of the certificate of title issued to him, the person claiming title to said lands under and through said registered owner by reason of his or its conveyance may file a petition with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the land is registered and in the proceeding under which the title was registered praying for the cancellation of the original certificate and the issuance of the new certificate. Upon the filing of such petition notice shall be published as prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t43a04s43-17.2" target="_self">G.S. 43-17.2</a></cite>. The clerk of the superior court with whom said petition is filed shall by order determine what additional notice, if any, shall be given to registered owners. If the registered owner is a natural person, deceased, or a corporation dissolved the court may direct what additional notice, if any, shall be given. The clerk shall hear the evidence, make findings of fact, and if found as a fact that the original certificate of the registered owner has been lost and cannot be found, shall enter his order directing the register of deeds to cancel the same and to issue a new certificate to such person or persons as may be entitled thereto, subject to such claims or liens as the court may find to exist.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any party within 10 days from the rendition of such judgment or order by the clerk of superior court of the county in which said land is registered may appeal to the superior court during a session of court, where the cause shall be heard de novo by the judge, unless a jury trial be demanded, in which event the issues of fact shall be submitted to a jury. From any order or judgment entered by the superior court during a session of court an appeal may be taken to the appellate division in the manner provided by law.

      Upon the filing of such duly verified petition, the petitioner shall cause to be published once a week for four weeks, in some newspaper having a general circulation in the county in which the land is situated, a notice signed by the clerk of the superior court, setting forth in substance the nature of the petition, a description of the land affected thereby, and the relief therein prayed for, and notifying all persons having or claiming any interest or estate in the land to appear at a time therein specified, which shall be at least 30 days after the first publication of said notice, to show cause, if any exists, why the relief prayed for in the petition should not be granted. An affidavit shall be filed by the publisher with the clerk of the court, showing a full compliance of this requirement. Upon a filing of said petition, the petitioner shall cause the summons, with a copy of the petition, to be served upon all persons, firms or corporations known to have any interest or estate in the lands referred to in the petition, and the personal representative, the devisees, if any, and all heirs at law of the deceased registered owner of said land. In the event any of the persons upon whom service of summons is to be made are nonresidents of the State of North Carolina, service may be made by publication in the manner prescribed by law for the service of summons in special proceedings.

       This section modifies the common-law rule of lis pendens.
   
   Its purpose is to stabilize titles by requiring recordation of all deeds, mortgages, or other paper-writings which transfer or encumber the title to land. Whitehurst v. Abbott, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 1</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 129 (1945).

       Unrecorded Deed Does Not Affect Lands Covered by Torrens Title.
   
   - Where title to lands was registered under the provisions of the Torrens Law, and the deed seeking to establish a boundary line and reserve a right-of-way across the lands was not recorded in the registration of titles book, and no notice of the existence thereof was made in said registration of titles book or upon the certificate of title, the deed and purported reservation of right-of-way had no effect whatever on the lands covered by the Torrens title.

     <p>
      Any person making any claim to or asserting any lien or charge upon registered land, existing at the initial registry of the same and not shown upon the register or adverse to the title of the registered owner, and for which no other provision is herein made for asserting the same in the registry of titles, may make an affidavit thereof setting forth his interest, right, title, lien or demand, and how and under whom derived, and the character and nature thereof. The affidavit shall state his place of residence and designate a place at which all notices relating thereto may be served. Upon the filing of such affidavit in the office of the clerk of the superior court, the clerk shall order a note thereof as in the case of charges or encumbrances, and the same shall be entered by the register of deeds. Action shall be brought upon such claim within six months after the entry of such note, unless for cause shown the clerk shall extend the time. Upon failure to commence such action within the time prescribed therefor, the clerk shall order a cancellation of such note. If any person shall wantonly or maliciously or without reasonable cause procure such notation to be entered upon the registry of titles, having the effect of a cloud upon the registered owner's title, he shall be liable for all damages the owner may suffer thereby.

     <p>
      Any registered owner or other claimant under the registered title may at any time apply to the court in which the original decree was entered, by petition, setting out that registered interests of any description, whether vested, contingent, expectant or inchoate, have terminated and ceased, or that new interests have arisen or been created which do not appear upon the certificate, or that any error or omission was made in entering or issuing the certificate or any duplicate thereof, or that the name of any person on the certificate has been changed, or that the registered owner had married or, if registered as married, that the marriage has been terminated, or that a corporation which owned registered lands has been dissolved, without conveying the same or transferring its certificate within three years after the dissolution, or any other reasonable and proper ground of correction or relief; and such court may hear and determine the petition after notice to all parties in interest, and may make such order or decree as may be appropriate and lawful in the premises; but nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize any such court to open any original decree of registration which was entered more than 12 months prior to the filing of such petition, and nothing shall be done or ordered by the court to divest or impair the title or other interest of a purchaser who holds a transfer or certificate of title for value and in good faith. No action or proceeding shall be commenced or maintained to set up or establish any right, claim, interest or estate adverse to the order or decree or certificate of title issued thereon made or entered upon any petition or other proceeding authorized by this section, unless the same shall be brought and instituted within six months from the date of such order or decree authorized by this section.

In case of default in payment of said debt with accrued interest, ________ days notice of sale required. 
    The same shall be signed and properly acknowledged by the parties making same, and shall be presented, together with the owner's certificate, to the register of deeds, whose duty it shall be to note upon the owner's certificate and upon the certificate of title in the consolidated real property records the name of the trustee, the amount of debt, and the date of maturity of same. 
  
  (b)  Part of Land Conveyed. - When a part of the registered estate shall be so conveyed, the register of deeds shall note upon the consolidated real property records and owner's certificate the part so conveyed, and if the same be required and the proper fee paid by the trustee, shall issue what shall be known as a partial certificate, over his hand and seal, setting out the portion so conveyed. 
  
  (c)  Effect of Transfer. - All transfers by such short form shall convey the power of sale upon due advertisement at the county courthouse and in some newspaper published in the county, or adjoining county, in the same manner and as fully as is now provided by law in the case of mortgages and deeds of trust and default therein. 
  
  (d)  Other Encumbrances Noted. - All registered encumbrances, rights or adverse claims affecting the estate represented thereby shall continue to be noted, not only upon the certificate of title in the consolidated real property records, but also upon the owner's certificate, until same shall have been released or discharged. And in the event of second or other subsequent voluntary encumbrances the holder of the certificate may be required to produce such certificate for the entry thereon or attachment thereto of the note of such subsequent charge or encumbrance as provided in this Article. 
  
  (e)  Other Forms of Conveyance May Be Used. - Nothing in this section nor this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the owner from conveying such land, or any part of the same, as security for a debt by deed of trust or mortgage in any form which may be agreed upon between the parties thereto, and having such deed of trust or mortgage recorded in the office of the register of deeds as other deeds of trust and mortgages are recorded: Provided, that the book and page of the record at which such deed of trust or mortgage is recorded shall be entered by the register of deeds upon the owner's certificate and also on the consolidated real property records. 
  
  (f)  Sale under Lien; New Certification. - Upon foreclosure of such deed of trust or mortgage, or sale under execution for taxes or other lien on the land, the fact of such foreclosure or sale shall be reported by the trustee, mortgagee or other person authorized to make the same, to the register of deeds of the county in which the land lies, and, upon satisfactory evidence thereof, it shall be his duty to call in and cancel the outstanding certificate of title for the land, so sold, and to issue a new certificate in its place to the purchaser or other person entitled thereto; and the production of such outstanding certificate and its surrender by the holder thereof may be compelled, upon notice to him, by motion before and order of the clerk of the superior court in the original proceeding or the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the land lies; but the right of appeal from such order may be exercised and shall be allowed as in other special proceedings, and pending any such appeal the rights of all parties shall be preserved.

   - When church officials sued seceders from the church to recover church property, the statute of frauds did not preclude the national or diocesan church's canons from establishing a valid trust in favor of the diocese as to church property without the signatures of the seceders because the seceders had previously accepted the canons as establishing a deed of trust in which the church's property would be held upon their withdrawal from the church.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any instrument affecting title to real estate describes a party as trustee or agent, or otherwise indicates that a party is or may be acting as trustee or agent, but does not indicate any beneficial interest, set forth his powers or specify some other recorded instrument setting forth such powers and the place in the public records where it is recorded, and there is no recorded instrument in the record chain of title to such real estate setting forth such powers, then the description or indication shall not be notice to any person thereafter dealing with the real estate of any limitation upon the powers of the party nor require any inquiry or investigation as to such trust or agency. Such trustee or agent shall be deemed to have full power to convey or otherwise dispose of the real estate; and no person interested under such trust or agency shall be entitled to make any claim against the real estate based upon notice given by such description or indication. This Article shall not prevent claims against the trustee or agent or against property other than the real estate.
