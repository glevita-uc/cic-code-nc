    This section does not apply to incidents that occurred before it was enacted.

    Deceased Defendant.
   
   - When an alleged injured party sought punitive damages against a motorist who died prior to the filing of the alleged injured party's complaint, the alleged injured party's claim for punitive damages was properly dismissed because the purpose in G.S. 1D-1 of deterring the motorist from committing similar wrongful acts could not be achieved. Harrell v. Bowen, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 857, 635 S.E.2d 498 (2006), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 142</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 350 (2008).
   </p>
   <p>
    Text of G.S. 1D-1 provides that punitive damages could be awarded "to punish a defendant for egregiously wrongful acts and to deter the defendant and others from committing similar wrongful acts," and it was a common rule of statutory construction that when the conjunctive "and" connected words, phrases or clauses of a statutory sentence, they were to be considered jointly, so an individual was subject to punitive damages where he or she could be punished for the egregiously wrongful act and be deterred from committing such an act in the future, but this did not apply to a deceased defendant. Harrell v. Bowen, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 857, 635 S.E.2d 498 (2006), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 142</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 350 (2008).

    Summary Judgment.
   
   - Officer was not entitled to summary judgment dismissing a citizen's punitive damages claim in an action alleging excessive force because: (1) the citizen alleged sufficiently egregious conduct to find the officer's willful and intentionally or recklessly injurious conduct, and (2) the officer did not show the citizen could not support the citizen's claims. Hart v. Brienza, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 784 S.E.2d 211, review denied, 793 S.E.2d 223, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 841 (2016).

    Entitlement to Punitive Damages.
   
   - Borrowers established willful or wanton tortious activity by a bank subsidiary pursuant to G.S. 1D-5(7) because the borrowers proved facts sufficient to show that the actions of the subsidiary were in conscious and intentional disregard of and indifference to the rights of the borrowers; furthermore, the subsidiary knew or should have known that by selling unlawful insurance with mortgage loans, its actions were reasonably likely to result in injury, damage, or other harm. Richardson v. Bank of Am., N.A., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 643 S.E.2d 410 (2007), petition allowed as to additional issues <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 569</cite>, 650 S.E.2d 439 (2007).

   <p>
    Claim for punitive damages could not be asserted against a decedent's estate on the basis of his alleged egregiously wrongful acts in driving while intoxicated and causing an accident; because decedent could no longer be punished or deterred for whatever "egregiously wrongful acts" he may have committed before his death, plaintiff was precluded as a matter of law from asserting his claim for punitive damages. Harrell v. Bowen, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 142</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 350 (2008).
   </p>
   <p>
    G.S. 1D-26 does not infer an obvious intent to have courts read "and" as a disjunctive in G.S. 1D-1, which governs all punitive damages claims; claims for punitive damages cannot be asserted against a decedent's estate on the basis of the decedent's alleged egregiously wrongful acts because a decedent cannot be punished or deterred for whatever egregiously wrongful act she may have committed before his death. State v. Moncree, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 655 S.E.2d 464 (2008).
   </p>
   <p>
    Evidence supported an award of punitive damages in the amount of $50,000 because (1) a debtor's conduct when it moved an auto dealership's vehicles without authorization was willful and wanton; (2) an officer of the debtor participated in and condoned the conduct; (3) the debtor set out to deliberately damage the dealership's property as the dealership's operators were caring for their ailing and elderly father; (4) the testimony of the debtor's employees clearly established that the debtor was aware that its conduct was inflicting serious harm as it was occurring; (5) the clear indifference of the debtor's directors regarding the continuing damage to the dealership's property resulting from the debtor's willful and wanton conduct was exceptional; and (6) the dealership was entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $372,489.

    727(a)(2), (4), and (6) where a debtor impersonated a real estate agent and lawyer in connection with an attempt to obtain money for his personal benefit through a sale of his condominium. Based on the uncertainty regarding whether the condominium was the debtor's residence, the court could not make a determination as to whether the trustee was eligible for treble damages under the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.S. 75-1.1, but because of the particularly egregious nature of the debtor's acts, as well as the extended duration of his conduct, the trustee, in addition to actual damages, was awarded $10,000 in punitive damages under G.S. 1D-1, as he established that the debtor committed fraud, an aggravating factor under G.S. 1D-15, by clear and convincing evidence.

     Abrogation.
    </b>
    - To the extent that the enactment of G.S. 1D-5(7) signaled the abrogation of the common law definition of gross negligence, it did so only in the context of cases where a plaintiff seeks punitive damages. FDIC v. Rippy, 799 F.3d 301 (4th Cir. 2015).
   </p>
   <p>
    "Willful or Wanton Conduct".
   
   - Where plaintiff workers were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers at defendant's polyester manufacturing plant, the jury returned verdicts in favor of plaintiffs, awarding them compensatory damages for personal injuries; however, defendant was entitled to a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages because the plant industrial hygienist's destruction of a memo stating the asbestos exposure was cause for concern did not constitute willful and wanton conduct by defendant. Schenk v. HNA Holdings, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 47, 604 S.E.2d 689 (2004).
   </p>
   <p>
    Directed verdict in favor of a manufacturing plant, a maintenance company, and its successor on the issue of punitive damages was upheld on appeal, because plaintiff workers failed to demonstrate any willful or wanton misconduct with regard to their exposure to asbestos when they removed insulation. The trial court's reduction of the workers' compensatory damages awards was also upheld on appeal, because the workers received prior workers' compensation claim settlements and prior third-party settlement amounts and were entitled to only one recovery for their asbestos exposure. Schenk v. HNA Holdings, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 555, 613 S.E.2d 503 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 177</cite>, 626 S.E.2d 649 (2005).

    Wife of a decedent who was electrocuted on a stairwell at an amphitheater, which was operated by a subsidiary, could not recover punitive damages under G.S. 1D-5(7), 1D-15(c), and 28A-18-2 because evidence showing: (1) that the subsidiary had been informed prior to the accident that other patrons had been electrocuted on a stairwell; and (2) that the subsidiary took ineffective efforts to address electrical hazards did not demonstrate a wilful and wanton disregard for the safety of others. Faris v. Clear Channel Communs., Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. Sept. 1, 2006).
   </p>
   <p>
    In a medical malpractice suit, a trial court's entry of summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to the plaintiffs' punitive damages claims was upheld on appeal based on the plaintiffs' failure to forecast sufficient evidence to meet the standard for punitive damages set forth in G.S. 1D-15(a); the plaintiffs did not contend that either fraud or malice existed and relied upon the willful or wanton conduct aggravating factor, but their complaint and proofs only alleged reckless supervision on the part of the defendants.

    It was error to grant the employer's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict as to punitive damages because there was sufficient evidence of malice, willful and wanton conduct, and manager participation to support the jury's punitive damages award to a terminated part-time department store employee based on, inter alia, the store manager's threat to "mess up" the employee's full-time job at a bank.

   <p>
    G.S. 20-145 provided an exception to the speed limit rules for emergency vehicles. Inclusion of the word "wanton" in police pursuit cases was a shorthand reference to the "reckless disregard" limitation of G.S. 20-145 and did not refer to the definition of the word from a wholly unrelated statute
   - G.S. 1D-5(7), the punitive damages statute. Villepigue v. City of Danville, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 661 S.E.2d 12 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 688</cite>, 671 S.E.2d 532 (2008).

    In a mother's wrongful death action, the trial court erred in granting a police department and police officers summary judgment on the mother's punitive damages claim because she alleged evidence sufficient to show that there was a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the conduct of the department and the officers was willful or wanton; that evidence was sufficient to allow a jury to decide, under G.S. 1D-5(7), that the department and officers acted recklessly, manifesting a reckless indifference to the rights of the mother and her daughter and that they acted with indifference to the rights and safety of others, which they knew or should have known was reasonably likely to result in injury, damage, or other harm. Cockerham-Ellerbee v. Town of Jonesville, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 660 S.E.2d 178 (2008), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 680</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 745 (2008).

    Although the corporation contended that it could not be held liable for punitive damages under G.S. 1D-15(c), it was not a case where the corporation's liability for punitive damages was based solely on vicarious liability; the assistant manager testified that in his interaction with the patrons, he was simply following the corporation's policy of completing the incident report form before investigating the nature of the incident. The corporation claimed that there was nothing wicked or needless about preparing a report that memorialized the facts of an incident that may be the subject of litigation, but this characterization of the policy failed to apply G.S. 1D-5(7)'s definition of willful or wanton conduct; a reasonable jury could disagree with the corporation's characterization of its policy and conclude to the contrary that the policy recklessly disregarded customers' safety and well-being in order to begin the process of protecting the corporation against potential litigation. Everhart v. O'Charley's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 683 S.E.2d 728 (2009).

   <p>
    Trial court did not err in denying a grantee's motion for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the issue of whether a property owner was entitled to punitive damages because nominal damages were recoverable for the loss of the owner's personal property as a matter of law, and her punitive damages award could be properly supported by an award of nominal damages standing alone; by purposely entering the owner's property, pillaging her assets, and then removing or eradicating every one of her personal possessions located at the property, the grantee, at the very least, showed a conscious and intentional disregard of and indifference to the rights and safety of others under G.S. 1D-5(7), and the jury's finding that the grantee's conversion was accompanied by an aggravating factor was supported by clear and convincing evidence. Mace v. Pyatt, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 691 S.E.2d 81 (2010), review denied 705 S.E.2d 354, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 1014 (2010).

    In a data company's action against a competitor that hired its former employee, the court upheld the jury verdict for the plaintiff because punitive damages for an unfair trade practice were warranted because of willful or wanton conduct in connection with an unjustified interference with an employment contract and not due to misappropriation of trade secrets.

    Plaintiffs were entitled to punitive damages in their medical malpractice suit against defendants (D), including a skilled nursing facility (SNF), as D engaged in willful or wanton conduct by: (1) intentionally failing to follow federal and state staffing laws; (2) intentionally violating the SNF's policy regarding sitters; (3) intentionally failing to monitor oxygen levels or to provide continuous monitoring of alarms; and (4) intentionally failing to have necessary bedside supplies in a vent unit. D knew, as it had been repeatedly told, that the failure to provide minimum staffing and supplies was reasonably likely to result in patient injury or death, yet they deliberately continued to disregard their duties.

    Intent to Commit Constructive Fraud Found.
   
   - Punitive damages were properly awarded because the evidence was sufficient to establish the intent to commit constructive fraud under G.S. 1D-5(4) as the trustee refused to distribute the assets of the trusts, despite the plain language of the trusts requiring distribution upon an individual's death, for reasons unrelated to the trusts and the trustee continued to receive trustee fees during the period in which the trustee served as a trustee and, thus, benefitted from the failure to distribute the trust assets.

    Consideration of Factors as to Each Plaintiff.
   
   - In the absence of some legislative directive, it is assumed that the trier of fact should, as it did at common law, consider the factors set forth in G.S. 1D-15(a) as to each plaintiff's cause of action and not as to each defendant; it follows that, like G.S. 1D-15(a), G.S. 1D-25(b) applies to the individual jury verdict of each plaintiff. Thus, where a jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages, which exceeded the statutory cap of G.S. 1D-25(b), to two plaintiffs against one defendant, the trial court properly reduced the individual awards to both plaintiffs and entered judgment against defendant in the amount of the statutory cap for each plaintiff.

    Claim for punitive damages against a singer, arising from an alleged battery, survived the author's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under N.C. R. Civ.

    Contrary to the corporation's argument, the patron was not required to prove that the willful and wanton conduct caused the patron's injuries, but rather was required to prove a connection between that conduct and her injuries and the evidence was sufficient to show a connection between the failure to investigate what the patron drank and her injuries. A jury could also find a connection between the evidence of the patron's emotional injuries and the assistant manager's deliberate disregard of the need to obtain information regarding what the patron swallowed. Everhart v. O'Charley's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 683 S.E.2d 728 (2009).

    Although the assistant manager knew the patron ingested some unknown substance that had made her sick, he refused to find out what she had actually been served or the first aid protocol for that substance before completing the corporation's incident report form; moreover, that form was not designed to provide assistance to the customer, but was focused on anticipating litigation. A jury could reasonably find from the evidence that the assistant manager chose to give preference to protecting the corporation from possible litigation over providing assistance to the patron who had been served a possibly toxic substance; the jury could then further conclude that the assistant manager acted with conscious and intentional disregard of and indifference to the patron's rights and safety, thus supporting a finding of willful or wanton conduct.

   <p>
    Although the corporation contended that it could not be held liable for punitive damages under G.S. 1D-15(c), it was not a case where the corporation's liability for punitive damages was based solely on vicarious liability; the assistant manager testified that in his interaction with the patrons, he was simply following the corporation's policy of completing the incident report form before investigating the nature of the incident. The corporation claimed that there was nothing wicked or needless about preparing a report that memorialized the facts of an incident that may be the subject of litigation, but this characterization of the policy failed to apply G.S. 1D-5(7)'s definition of willful or wanton conduct; a reasonable jury could disagree with the corporation's characterization of its policy and conclude to the contrary that the policy recklessly disregarded customers' safety and well-being in order to begin the process of protecting the corporation against potential litigation.

    Constitutionality - Separation of Powers.
   
   - G.S. 1D-25, which places a cap on punitive damages, did not unconstitutionally violate the principle of separation of powers, contrary to N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   6, by exercising the power of remittitur because the cap on punitive damages is different from remittitur in that it requires an award to be limited after a proper jury trial, while remittitur is utilized only after a court has determined that a party has not received a fair and proper jury trial. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   </p>
   <p>
    G.S. 1D-25 does not operate as a "legislative remittitur" because, unlike remittitur, G.S. 1D-25 does not grant the General Assembly the authority to remit excessive awards on a case-by-case basis, but rather, by enacting G.S. 1D-25, the General Assembly has imposed a limit on the recovery of punitive damages in all cases; this function is wholly distinct from that within the trial court's authority to apply fixed laws to individual controversies, and thus, G.S. 1D-25 did not violate separation of powers principles under N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   6. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   </p>
   <p>
    G.S. 1D-25 does not represent an impermissible interference with the judiciary's constitutionally defined authority because the Constitution neither expressly nor implicitly empowers North Carolina courts to award punitive damages or to remit excessive awards thereof; rather, because punitive damages are awarded on grounds of public policy, G.S. 1D-25 is a modification of the common law within the General Assembly's policy-making authority to define legally cognizable remedies. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

   <p>
    Constitutionality - Open Courts.
   
   - G.S. 1D-25, which places a cap on punitive damages, is not unconstitutional under the open courts provision in N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   </p>
   <p>
    Because the Open Courts Clause of N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   18 does not prevent the General Assembly from abolishing the recovery of punitive damages altogether, it follows that G.S. 1D-25, which limits the awards of punitive damages, does not violate the Open Courts Clause. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

    Constitutionality - Due Process.
   
   - G.S. 1D-25, placing a cap on an award of punitive damages, does not take property without just compensation, infringing on a fundamental right, contrary to N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, because punitive damages are not property belonging to an individual. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   </p>
   <p>
    The statutory limit on punitive damages in G.S. 1D-25 does not constitute an unconstitutional taking of property by denying plaintiffs of the "enjoyment of the fruits of their own labor" under N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1 because (1) a jury's verdict is not "property" in which a plaintiff enjoys a vested right where the limitation on punitive damages applies prior to the entry of judgment; and (2) a litigant's participation in a trial is not a "labor" nor is a jury's verdict the "fruits" of that labor. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   </p>
   <p>
    As the jury awarded the patron $10,000 in compensatory damages, the trial court reduced the jury's punitive damages award of $350,000 to $250,000 in accordance with G.S. 1D-25(b); in light of the reprehensibility of the corporation's conduct, the relatively low ratio of punitive damages to compensatory damages, and the civil and criminal sanctions that might have been imposed for similar conduct, the trial court did not err in determining that the punitive damages award did not violate the corporation's due process rights.

    Constitutionality - Equal Protection.

   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, because no fundamental right is involved and the statute makes no mention of suspect classifications, subjecting it to rational basis review, and because the statute bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest in the state's economic development.

   </p>
   <p>
    Because the limitation on punitive damages contained in G.S.1D-25 bears some rational relationship to several legitimate governmental interests, G.S. 1D-25 does not violate principles of due process and equal protection as guaranteed by N.C. Cont. art. I,

   </p>
   <p>
    Constitutionality - Vagueness.
   
   - G.S. 1D-25, which places a cap on punitive damages, is not unconstitutionally vague because it provides sufficient language for uniform judicial administration. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   </p>
   <p>
    G.S. 1D-25 is not unconstitutionally vague because the court can apply the rules of statutory construction to discern a meaning from G.S. 1D-25 that can be uniformly administered. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Constitutionality - Special Legislation.
   
   - G.S. 1D-25, placing a cap on an award of punitive damages, is not unconstitutional special legislation contrary to N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24, which prohibits the enactment of any local, private or special legislation remitting fines, penalties and forfeitures, because it does not constitute remittitur. Rhyne v.

   32, because it applies equally to all defendants and creates no distinction between groups. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

   </p>
   <p>
    Constitutionality - Right to Jury Trial.
   
   - G.S. 1D-25, which places a cap on punitive damages, does not violate injured parties' rights to a jury trial, under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25, because the right to punitive damages is not a property interest, and there is only a right to a civil jury trial concerning property. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   </p>
   <p>
    Although N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 appears to embody a broad definition of the term "'property," a controversy in which punitive damages are assessed is not one which enforces a plaintiff's legal rights and, therefore, does not respect property; thus, G.S. 1D-25 in no way infringes upon plaintiffs' right to a trial by jury under N.C. Const. art. 1,

   <p>
    Construction With Other Laws.
   
   - G.S. 1D-26 does not infer an obvious intent to have courts read "and" as a disjunctive in G.S. 1D-1, which governs all punitive damages claims; claims for punitive damages cannot be asserted against a decedent's estate on the basis of the decedent's alleged egregiously wrongful acts because a decedent cannot be punished or deterred for whatever egregiously wrongful acts he may have committed before his death.

   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Application of Section Upheld.
   
   - G.S. 1D-25, which places a cap on punitive damages, was appropriately applied to limit each individual plaintiff's punitive damages award, rather than being applied per each plaintiff's claim or per defendant. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

   <p>
    G.S. 1D-25 is not to be applied retroactively and, therefore, applies only to cases arising after January 1, 1996. Rhone-Poulenc Agro SA v. DeKalb Genetics Corp., 272 F.3d 1335 (4th Cir. 2001).
   </p>
   <p>
    Cap Applies to Individual Jury Verdict of Each Plaintiff, Not Each Defendant.
   
   - In the absence of some legislative directive, it is assumed that the trier of fact should, as it did at common law, consider the factors set forth in G.S. 1D-15(a) as to each plaintiff's cause of action and not as to each defendant; it follows that, like G.S. 1D-15(a), G.S. 1D-25(b) applies to the individual jury verdict of each plaintiff. Thus, where a jury awarded compensatory and punitive damages, which exceeded the statutory cap of G.S. 1D-25(b), to two plaintiffs against one defendant, the trial court properly reduced the individual awards to both plaintiffs and entered judgment against defendant in the amount of the statutory cap for each plaintiff.

     Punitive Damage Award with Comparative Ratio Greater Than Three.

    - G.S. 1D-15 and G.S. 1D-25, when taken together, imply that a punitive damage award with a comparative ratio greater than three, based upon a showing of fraud by only a preponderance of the evidence, will not be upheld under North Carolina law. Rhone-Poulenc Agro SA v. DeKalb Genetics Corp., 272 F.3d 1335 (4th Cir. 2001).
   </p>

    Award Within the Statutory Boundaries for Punitive Damages
   
   - Where a jury awarded lessees compensatory damages in the amount of $62,001.00 for breach of a lease/purchase agreement and conversion and punitive damages in the amount of $150,000.00, the amount of punitive damages was well within the boundaries provided in G.S. 1D-25(b) and was not excessively disproportionate to the circumstances of contumely and indignity present in the case.

    Illustrative Cases.
   
   - An award of punitive damages of $500,000 to the former wife against the current wife for alienation of affections and criminal conversion was not excessive, considering that the jury awarded the same amount in compensatory damages, and thus, could have awarded $1,500,000 in punitive damages.

   </p>
   <p>
    Punitive damages award against a boyfriend in an alienation of affections claim was warranted pursuant to G.S. 1D-15 where it was shown that the boyfriend had sexual relations on at least two occasions with the husband's wife; additionally, the award was not deemed excessive where it did not go beyond the limits established by subsection (b) of this section, and accordingly, the trial court's denial of the boyfriend's motion for a new trial on that issue, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 59, was proper.

   </p>
   <p>
    When an employer sued a competitor for involvement in the employer's former employees' employment contract violations, a punitive damages award erred because, when a trial court concluded each defendant engaged in conduct warranting such damages, the court improperly considered relevant factors not as to each plaintiff's cause of action, as required, but as to each defendant. Ge Betz, Inc. v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 752 S.E.2d 634 (2013).

   <p>
    Trial court did not err by denying an executrix's motion for a new trial with respect to the amount of punitive damages awarded in connection with beneficiaries' breach of fiduciary duty claim because the executrix's conduct was, when considered in its entirety, exceedingly reprehensible; the ratio of compensatory damages to punitive damages was consistent with ratios that had been held not to be excessive in other cases.

    Under this section, plaintiffs' punitive damages awards were limited to $ 250,000 for plaintiff one and $ 900,000 for plaintiffs two and three as their compensatory damage awards were $ 50,000 and $ 300,000, respectively.

    Upon the motion of a defendant, the issues of liability for compensatory damages and the amount of compensatory damages, if any, shall be tried separately from the issues of liability for punitive damages and the amount of punitive damages, if any. Evidence relating solely to punitive damages shall not be admissible until the trier of fact has determined that the defendant is liable for compensatory damages and has determined the amount of compensatory damages. The same trier of fact that tried the issues relating to compensatory damages shall try the issues relating to punitive damages.

    <b>
     Application of Factors.
    </b>
    - Although a former officer of a corporation was liable to the corporation for compensatory damages based on fraud and breach of fiduciary duty, punitive damages were not warranted since the officer reasonably believed that an agreement with the corporation was valid, engaged in no similar misconduct, only engaged in the misconduct for a brief period, did not conceal any of the conduct, and had no ability to pay a punitive award. Anderson v. Brokers, Inc. (In re Brokers, Inc.), 396 B.R. 146 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2008).
   </p>
   <p>
    Evidence supported an award of punitive damages in the amount of $50,000 because (1) a debtor's conduct when it moved an auto dealership's vehicles without authorization was willful and wanton; (2) an officer of the debtor participated in and condoned the conduct; (3) the debtor set out to deliberately damage the dealership's property as the dealership's operators were caring for their ailing and elderly father; (4) the testimony of the debtor's employees clearly established that the debtor was aware that its conduct was inflicting serious harm as it was occurring; (5) the clear indifference of the debtor's directors regarding the continuing damage to the dealership's property resulting from the debtor's willful and wanton conduct was exceptional; and (6) the dealership was entitled to compensatory damages in the amount of $372,489. In re Brokers, Inc., 407 B.R. 693 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2009).

    727(a)(2), (4), and (6) where a debtor impersonated a real estate agent and lawyer in connection with an attempt to obtain money for his personal benefit through a sale of his condominium. Based on the uncertainty regarding whether the condominium was the debtor's residence, the court could not make a determination as to whether the trustee was eligible for treble damages under the Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, G.S. 75-1.1, but because of the particularly egregious nature of the debtor's acts, as well as the extended duration of his conduct, the trustee, in addition to actual damages, was awarded $10,000 in punitive damages under G.S. 1D-1, as he established that the debtor committed fraud, an aggravating factor under G.S. 1D-15, by clear and convincing evidence. Warren v. Coats (In re Coats), 435 B.R. 915 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2010).
   </p>
   <p>
    Debtor acted with actual malice when he made multiple statements on a radio program to the effect that the creditor had interfered with the debtor's treatment of a patient, resulting in permanent harm to the patient, and thus, an award of actual and punitive damages was nondischargeable under 11 U.S.C.S.
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    523(a)(6). In exercising its discretion under G.S. 1D-35 to award punitive damages, the court considered the following factors: the debtor's behavior and the motives that prompted it were reprehensible; the likelihood of causing serious harm to the creditor was high, a fact of which the debtor was not only aware, but which he in fact sought to accomplish; the debtor caused the creditor to incur at least a moderate drop in his income; the debtor stood to gain by persuading the public and other doctors to avoid the creditor as a physician; the debtor's current earnings, as well as his earning potential, were such that he was able to pay punitive damages; and the debtor would, unless it was otherwise made abundantly clear, persist in his public campaign of disinformation with respect to the creditor.

    In an action for damages by four police officers against a rapper, a record company, and others, assuming an award of punitive damages was proper, the amount of punitive damages awarded did not constitute an abuse of discretion where the judgment specifically indicated that the trial court had considered the purpose of punitive damages, and the trial court concluded that the defendants' conduct and motives were reprehensible, that they were or should have been aware of the likelihood of serious harm to the police officers, and that they had the ability to pay the award.

    Fees Awarded Where Punitive Damages Claim Dismissed.
   
   - G.S. 1D-45 supported the award of attorneys' fees to a homeowners association and board members attorneys' fees because the trial court dismissed homeowners' punitive damages claim under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12; in awarding attorneys' fees, the record showed that the trial court was considering the award as it was ruling on the associations' motion to dismiss the homeowners' various counterclaims and defenses under N.C. R. Civ. P. 12 and 41, and that included a ruling as to punitive damages. Moss Creek Homeowners Ass'n v. Bissette, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C.

   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Abuse of Discretion to Reduce Attorneys' Fees Based on Punitive Damages Award.
   
   - Trial court abused its discretion to the extent that it reduced the amount of attorneys' fees that it would have otherwise awarded to beneficiaries based solely on the fact that the beneficiaries received a large punitive damages award because the fact that they received a large punitive damages award was not relevant to a proper attorneys' fee calculation. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
   </p>
   <p>
    As a result of the different purposes sought to be achieved by punitive damages and attorneys' fee awards, a decision to reduce an attorneys' fee award based on the fact that a party received a large punitive damages award would necessarily serve to thwart the purposes sought to be achieved by allowing the recovery of punitive damages without serving any purpose sought to be achieved by an award of attorneys' fees. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
   </p>
   <p>
    Although attorneys' fee jurisprudence gives trial judges substantial discretion in determining what amount of attorneys' fees to award in any particular case, the use of a substantial punitive damages award as the sole reason for reducing an otherwise reasonable attorneys' fee award involves reliance upon a factor that has no reasonable bearing on the making of a proper attorneys' fee award and, for that reason, constitutes an abuse of the trial court's discretion. Lacey v. Kirk, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 767 S.E.2d 632 (2014).
   <br />
   </p>
   <p>
    Further Findings Required.
   
   - Trial court's award of attorneys' fees had to be remanded for further findings because the recipient of the award had retained out-of-state counsel whose fee was significantly greater than local counsel, but the court did not find that the retention of out-of-state counsel was required. Ge Betz, Inc. v. Conrad, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 752 S.E.2d 634 (2013).

   </p>
   <p>
    <b>
     Apportionment of Fees Unnecessary.
    </b>
    - Trial court did not err in awarding defendants attorney fees; the trial court did not err in determining that both the recoverable punitive damages claim and the non-recoverable claims arose from a common nucleus of law and fact and were inextricably interwoven, such that apportionment of fees between the punitive damages claim and the underlying claims was unnecessary.

    <b>
     Fees Properly Awarded.
    </b>
    - There was competent evidence supporting the challenged findings, which as a whole supported the ultimate finding that plaintiff's claims were frivolous and malicious; he admitted to unprofessional conduct, he knew of his non-compliance and continued to violate hospital bylaws, but then persisted in his allegations that his privileges were revoked without any basis, and there was a valid basis for the initiation of corrective action, and thus the trial court did not err in awarding defendants attorney fees.

    Remand for Compliance with this Section.
   
   - Action was remanded because the trial court's order granting the former employer's motion for judgment notwithstanding verdict contained no reasons as to why the trial court set aside the jury's verdict on the former employee's punitive damages claim. Scarborough v. Dillard's, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 632 S.E.2d 800 (2006).

   <p>
    Trial court erred in partially granting defendant's JNOV motion and setting aside the jury's award of punitive damages where it failed to address with specificity the evidence it found to be lacking as required by G.S. 1D-50 but merely stated that the evidence was insufficient. The case was remanded to the trial court to issue a written opinion setting forth its specific reasons for granting the motion. Hayes v. Waltz, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 784 S.E.2d 607 (2016).
