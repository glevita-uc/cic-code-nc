    Editor's Note.
   
   - This Chapter is <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.104C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 104C</a></cite> as rewritten by Session Laws 1975, c. 718, s. 1, effective July 1, 1975, and recodified. Session Laws 1975, c. 718, s. 8, provided that s. 1 of the act would expire June 30, 1981. Session Laws 1975, c. 718, s. 8, was amended by Session Laws 1981, c. 393, so as to delete the provision for expiration of the act.
   </p>
   <p>
    The provision of Session Laws 1977, c. 712, as amended, tentatively repealing this Chapter effective July 1, 1983, was itself repealed by Session Laws 1981, c. 932, s. 1.
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 1987, c. 850, which amended many of the sections of this Chapter, provided in s. 27(a) that c. 850 would not be construed as a revenue bill within the meaning of N.C. Const., Art. II,

     No land may be used as a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility until fee simple title to the land has been conveyed to the State of North Carolina. In consideration for such conveyance, the State shall enter into a lease agreement with the grantor for a term equal to the estimated life of the facility in which the State will be the lessor and the grantor the lessee. Such lease agreement shall specify that for an annual rent of fifty dollars ($50.00), the lessee shall be allowed to use the land for the development and operation of a low-level radioactive waste disposal facility. Such lease agreement shall provide that the lessor or any person authorized by the lessor shall have at all times the right to enter without a search warrant or permission of the lessee upon any and all parts of the premises for monitoring, inspection and all other purposes necessary to carry out the provisions of Chapter 104E. The lessee shall remain fully liable for all damages, losses, personal injury or property damage which may result or arise out of the lessee's operation of the facility, and for compliance with regulatory requirements concerning insurance, bonding for closure and post-closure costs, monitoring and other financial or health and safety requirements as required by applicable law and regulations. The State, as lessor, shall be immune from liability except as otherwise provided by statute. The lease shall be transferrable with the written consent of the lessor, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. In the case of such a transfer of the lease, the transferee shall be subject to all terms and conditions that the State deems necessary to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If the lessee or any successor in interest fails in any material respect to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or license condition, or with any term or condition of the lease, the State may terminate the lease after giving the lessee written notice specifically describing the failure to comply and upon providing the lessee a reasonable time to comply. If the lessee does not effect compliance within the reasonable time allowed, the State may reenter and take possession of the premises.

    <li id="t104Es104E-6.1ol1b">
     Notwithstanding the termination of the lease by either the lessee or the lessor for any reason, the lessee shall remain liable for, and be obligated to perform all acts necessary or required by law, regulation, license conditions or the lease for the permanent closure of the site until the site has either been permanently closed or until a substitute operator has been secured and assumed the obligations of the lessee.
    </li>
    <li id="t104Es104E-6.1ol1c">
     In the event of changes in laws or regulations applicable to the facility which make continued operation by the lessee impossible or economically infeasible, the lessee shall have the right to terminate the lease upon giving the State reasonable notice of not less than six months, in which case the lessor shall have the right to secure a substitute lessee and operator.
    </li>
    <li id="t104Es104E-6.1ol1d">
     In the event of termination of the lease by the lessor as provided in subsection (a) of this section, or by the lessee as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the lessee shall be paid the fair market value of any improvements made to the leased premises less the costs to the lessor resulting from termination of the lease and securing a substituted lessee and operator; provided, that the lessor shall have no obligation to secure a substitute lessee or operator and may require the lessee to permanently close the facility.

All rules and regulations for radiation protection that were adopted by the Commission for Public Health and are not inconsistent with the provisions of this Chapter shall remain in full force and effect unless and until repealed or superseded by action of the Radiation Protection Commission. The Radiation Protection Commission is authorized:
     <ol>

    Upon completion of any project or activity stated in G.S. 104E-16(a)(1), and from time to time during any project or activity stated in G.S. 104E-16(a)(2), each State and local agency that has participated by furnishing personnel, equipment or material shall deliver to the Department a record of the expenses incurred by the agency. The amount of incurred expenses shall be disbursed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services to each such agency from the Radiation Protection Fund. Upon completion of any project or activity stated in G.S. 104E-16(a)(1), and from time to time during any project or activity stated in G.S. 104E-16(a)(2), the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall prepare a statement of all expenses and costs of the project or activity expended by the State and shall make demand for payment upon the person having control over the radioactive materials or the release thereof which necessitated said project or activity. Any person having control over the radioactive materials or the release thereof and any other person causing or contributing to an incident necessitating any project or activity stated in G.S. 104E-16 shall be directly liable to the State for the necessary expenses incurred thereby and the State shall have a cause of action to recover from any or all such persons. If the person having control over the radioactive materials or the release thereof shall fail or refuse to pay the sum expended by the State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall refer the matter to the Attorney General of North Carolina, who shall institute an action in the name of the State in the Superior Court of Wake County, or in his discretion, in the superior court of the county in which the project or activity was undertaken by the State, to recover such cost and expenses.
   </p>
   <p>
    In any action instituted by the Attorney General under this section, a verified and itemized statement of the expenses incurred by the State in any project or activity stated in G.S. 104E-16 shall be filed with the complaint and shall constitute prima facie the amount due the State; and any judgment for the State thereon shall be for such amount in the absence of allegation and proof on the part of the defendant or defendants that the statement of expenses incurred by and the amount due the State is not correct because of an error in:

   <p>
    Standards and criteria for licensing low-level radioactive waste facilities shall be developed by the Commission. Such standards and criteria shall be developed with public participation and shall be incorporated into rules adopted by the Commission for the licensing of such facilities. Standards and criteria shall be consistent with all applicable federal and State law, including statutes, regulations and rules; shall be developed and revised in light of the best available scientific data; and shall be based on consideration of at least the following factors:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t104Es104E-26ol11">
     Hydrological and geological factors, including flood plains, depth to water table, groundwater travel time, soil pH, soil cation exchange capacity, soil composition and permeability, cavernous bedrock, seismic activity, slope, mines, climate and earthquake faults;
    </li>
    <li id="t104Es104E-26ol12">
     Environmental and public health factors, including air quality, quality of surface and groundwater, and proximity to public water supply watersheds;
