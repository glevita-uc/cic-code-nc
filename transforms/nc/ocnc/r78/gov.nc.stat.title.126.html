                <p>
                    It is the intent and purpose of this Chapter to establish for the government of the State a system of personnel administration under the Governor, based on accepted principles of personnel administration and applying the best methods as evolved in government
                    and industry. It is also the intent of this Chapter that this system of personnel administration shall apply to local employees paid entirely or in part from federal funds, except to the extent that local governing boards are authorized
                    by this Chapter to establish local rules, local pay plans, and local personnel systems. It is also the intent of this Chapter to make provisions for a decentralized system of personnel administration, where appropriate, and without
                    additional cost to the State, with the State Human Resources Commission as the policy and rule-making body. The Office of State Human Resources shall make recommendations for policies and rules to the Commission based on research and
                    study in the field of personnel management, develop and administer statewide standards and criteria for good personnel management, provide training and technical assistance to all agencies, departments, and institutions, provide oversight,
                    which includes conducting audits to monitor compliance with established State Human Resources Commission policies and rules, administer a system for implementing necessary corrective actions when the rule, standards, or criteria are
                    not met, and serve as the central repository for State Human Resources system data. The agency, department, and institution heads shall be responsible and accountable for execution of Commission policies and rules for their employees.

                        just cause, the act exempts certain employees by its terms and allows the Governor to designate as exempt from the provisions of the act certain other policy-making or decision-making employees. Where plaintiffs having a position
                        designated as policy-making or confidential by the previous Governor brought suit alleging that each was discharged from an exempt government position for the sole reason of political affiliation, there was a presumption that successor

                        Employee as she did not meet the 24-month statutory requirement to warrant protection under the North Carolina State Personnel Act, and to the extent the employee alleged that she had some agreement with her employer that was not
                        premised on her status as a Career State Employee, she failed to provide evidence of an agreement that supported her allegations that she could only be terminated for just cause. Robinson v. Bowser, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Oct.

                        Former Department of Social Services Employee. - Administrative law judge (ALJ) properly concluded that a technician who worked for a county department of social services was a career State employee under the State Human Resources Act (SHRA) and was subject
                        to the SHRA because the county board of commissioners passed resolutions leaving the employees of the consolidated human services agency subject to the SHRA; therefore, just cause was required to support the technician's termination.

                        Commission] has authority to issue a policy thereon and to require the Department of Justice to follow it. North Carolina Dep't of Justice v. Eaker, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 367 S.E.2d

                        Plaintiff whose position was abolished and employment terminated did not have to show prejudice once he carried his burden of showing that the Department of Justice failed to follow the State Personnel Commission's [now State Human Resources Commission's]
                        policies. North Carolina Dep't of Justice v. Eaker, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 367 S.E.2d 392, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 836</cite>, 371 S.E.2d 279 (1988).

                        Retention of Temporary Employees Beyond 12 Months. - When temporary state employees sued the State for employing the employees more than 12 months, contrary to N.C. Admin. Code 1C.0405(a), the employees' breach of contract claim was properly dismissed
                        because: (1) nothing showed the State induced the employees to work more than 12 months, beyond paying normal wages, or said the employees would become permanent after 12 months, and (2) no authority required the State to convert
                        the employees' status to permanent. Sanders v. State Pers. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 762 S.E.2d 850 (2014).

                        Burden to Show Department or Agency Followed State Human Resources Commission's Procedures. - Neither <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html" target="_blank">Chapter 126</a></cite> nor the Administrative Procedure
                        Act indicates that the burden is shifted to the department or agency to show that it followed the Personnel Commission's rules, policies, or procedures. North Carolina Dep't of Justice v. Eaker, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C.

                        Dismissals. - Just cause for dismissal has been divided into two basic categories - unsatisfactory job performance and personal conduct (misconduct) detrimental to State service. Amanini v. N.C. Dep't of Human Resources,
                        <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 443 S.E.2d 114 (1994).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The distinction between the categories of "just cause" as set forth in the State Personnel Manual provides an applicable test for determining whether a dismissal is for a "good or adequate reason having basis in fact" under particular circumstances. Amanini
                        v. N.C. Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 443 S.E.2d 114 (1994).

                        Attorney Fees. - Upon appeal of the Commission's decision not to award attorney's fees under subdivision (11) of this section, G.S. 126-41 (now repealed) constrained the Superior Court to reverse or modify the Commission's order only if it was deemed
                        unreasonable or inadequate. Morgan v. North Carolina DOT, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 180, 476 S.E.2d 431 (1996).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the Commission had statutory authority to award attorney's fees only in cases involving discrimination, reinstatement or back pay, the Commission properly denied an award of attorney's fees to petitioners. Morgan v. North Carolina DOT,
                        <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 180, 476 S.E.2d 431 (1996).

                        North Carolina State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] correctly found on remand that it had jurisdiction to assess attorney fees for the administrative portion of a case against a county department of social services pursuant
                        to G.S. 126-4(11) and award such fees pursuant to 25 N.C. Admin. Code 1B.0414. Early v. County of Durham, Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 667 S.E.2d 512 (2008), review

                        Legislative Intent. - The particularized exclusion of certain Department of Correction employees from the provisions of this chapter plainly indicates the General Assembly's intent that the Act's provisions for appeals of employment grievances apply to
                        those not so excluded. Batten v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 338</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 35 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Empire Power Co. v. North Carolina Dep't of Env't,

        The rationale for creating exempt positions,
       </b> positions exempt from the protection afforded by the civil service statute, was to allow the Governor to employ top level State employees on an at-will basis, and to reposition these employees as he felt necessary in
                        order to further the agenda of the administration. Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134 (4th Cir. 1990).

        Discharge of Exempt Employees by Successor Governor.
       </b> - Although the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides that no permanent employee subject thereto shall be discharged, suspended or reduced in pay or position except for
                        just cause, the act exempts certain employees by its terms and allows the Governor to designate as exempt from the provisions of the act certain other policy-making or decision-making employees. Where plaintiffs having a position
                        designated as policy-making or confidential by the previous Governor brought suit alleging that each was discharged from an exempt government position for the sole reason of political affiliation, there was a presumption that successor
                        Governor's actions were proper if done for political patronage reasons that require, as a qualification for the performance of a job, a political affiliation. Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134 (4th Cir. 1990).

                        Since an investigatorial assistant's public statements criticizing the district attorney's discretionary decisions and the disruption of his office's working relationship with law enforcement agencies were sufficient reasons, standing alone, to terminate
                        the investigatorial assistant's at will employment, the district attorney's decision to terminate him rested within his lawful and discretionary scope of authority; because the investigatorial assistant's termination was not injurious
                        to the public or against the public good, there was no evidence to establish a genuine issue of material fact to support a claim for wrongful discharge against the district attorney. Hines v. Yates,

                        Priority Consideration. - Where nurse was a state employee who applied for a supervisory nursing position of state employment, and there was substantial evidence to support the finding that petitioner's qualifications were "substantially equal" to the

                        When the Director of the Budget determines that the closing of a State institution or a reduction in force will accomplish economies in the State Budget, the Director of the Budget shall pay either a discontinued service retirement allowance or severance
                        wages to any affected State employee, provided reemployment is not available. As used in this section, "economies in the State Budget" means economies resulting from elimination of a job and its responsibilities or from a lack

                    as a result of economies in the State Budget may be entitled to a discontinued service retirement allowance, subject to the approval of the employing agency and the availability of agency funds. An unreduced discontinued service retirement
                    allowance, not otherwise allowed, may be approved for employees with 20 or more years of creditable retirement service who are at least 55 years of age; or a discontinued service retirement allowance, not otherwise allowed, may be
                    approved for employees with 20 or more years of creditable retirement service who are at least 50 years of age, reduced by one-fourth of one percent (1/4 of 1%) for each month that retirement precedes the employee's fifty-fifth birthday.

                    The salary used to determine severance wages under this section is the last annual salary except that if the employee was promoted within the previous 12 months, the last annual salary is that annual salary prior to the promotion. If the annual salary

                    detailed in the Review of Reserve Funds in the 2004-2005 Revised Certified Budget, there was an appearance of impropriety that reflected a process that was neither open nor fair. See opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Leslie
                    Merritt, Auditor, 2005 N.C.A.G. 3 (09/12/05).

        Construction with Federal Provision.
       </b> - Where a complainant steadfastly maintains that he has brought only a Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act of 1964) claim and the state referral agency unequivocally addresses only that claim, proceedings under state
                        law have not commenced for purposes of 42 U.S.C.A.

                    <p>
                        Applicability. - State employee seeking review of her termination was entitled to enforce the rights implicated by G.S. 126-16, providing for equal employment opportunity, but G.S. 126-16 did not address the procedural avenues available to particular
                        categories of state employees, did not entitle the employee to choose a review scheme from which she was otherwise excluded, and did not affirmatively grant her a remedy. Woodburn v. N.C. State Univ.,

                    <p>
                        Employer's Use of Non-Objective Factors in Hiring. - Beyond the use of experience and training to limit a field of applicants, an employer is relatively free to value experience among the applicants as it sees fit in light of the skills required by the
                        position to be filled. This freedom is of intrinsic value to the hiring process and business judgment of decision makers. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                        233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Burden-Shifting Analysis Applies. - North Carolina Supreme Court has adopted the United States Supreme Court's "burden shifting" scheme set out in the McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973); therefore, North Carolina courts
                        look to federal decisions for guidance in establishing evidentiary standards and principles of law to be applied in discrimination cases. In properly applying the burden-shifting scheme the ultimate burden of persuading the trier
                        of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                        233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Employer's Articulation of Nondiscriminatory Reasons for Hiring Decisions. - Although a female African-American social services employee had 20 years' experience and the white male who was promoted instead of her had only eight years, the employer articulated
                        nondiscriminatory reasons for its hiring decision, including initiative, community outreach, and communications skills. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                        233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Employer's Burden to Rebut Presumption of Discrimination. - Employer's burden is satisfied if he simply explains what he has done or produces evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons; the employer is not required to prove that its action was actually
                        motivated by the proffered reasons for it is sufficient if the evidence raises a genuine issue of fact as to whether the claimant is a victim of intentional discrimination. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Evidence of Pretext for Discrimination. - Some of the factors that courts have considered as relevant evidence of pretext are: (1) evidence that white employees involved in acts against the employer of comparable seriousness were retained or rehired;
                        (2) evidence of the employer's treatment of the employee during his term of employment; (3) evidence of the employer's response to the employee's legitimate civil rights activities; and (4) evidence of the employer's general policy
                        and practice with respect to minority employees. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Plaintiff's Burden of Proving Discrimination. - Burden to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination giving rise to a presumption of discrimination is as follows: (1) plaintiff is a member of a minority group; (2) she was qualified for a promotion;
                        (3) she was passed over for the promotion; and (4) the person receiving the promotion was not a member of a protected class. To rebut the presumption of discrimination, the employer must clearly explain by admissible evidence the
                        nondiscriminatory reasons for the employee's rejection or discharge; the plaintiff must then show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered explanation by the State is pretextual in nature, and that the employer intentionally
                        discriminated. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence. - During an attempt to show that an employer's proffered explanation of a nondiscriminatory reason for an employee's rejection or discharge is pretextual, the plaintiff can reuse evidence from her prima facie showing to assist in carrying her
                        burden as to pretext though the prima facie presumption has been dispelled. However, the court is not at liberty to review the soundness or reasonableness of an employer's business judgment when it considers whether alleged disparate
                        treatment is a pretext for discrimination: the sole question is what is the motivation behind the employer's decision. Enoch v. Alamance County Dep't of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite>                        233, 595 S.E.2d 744 (2004).

       Referral Incentive Award Program.

                    did not have any provision in it that would require or allow the State to pay any kind of fee that might be charged by a licensed referral source to the jobhunter. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Ronald G. Penny, State Personnel

                    have failed; however, the statutorily mandated promotional priority for state employees under this section restricts and limits the ability of state agencies to act in this situation. See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Richard

                        Libel Claim. - Even if a tenured public university professor's libel claim was brought against a department head in his individual capacity, the libel claim, which was based on the department head's annual review of the professor, failed because the department
                        head was required to write and maintain a public record of the professor's official status at the university, G.S. 126-23, the dean of the college had the right to review the full contents of the record, G.S. 126-24(2), and when
                        state employees had statutory rights and obligations regarding the maintenance of employee records, communication in conformity with those rights and obligations did not constitute publication for a libel suit. White v. Trew,

                        Libel Claim. - Even if a tenured public university professor's libel claim was brought against a department head in his individual capacity, the libel claim, which was based on the department head's annual review of the professor, failed because the department
                        head was required to write and maintain a public record of the professor's official status at the university, G.S. 126-23, the dean of the college had the right to review the full contents of the record, G.S. 126-24(2), and when
                        state employees had statutory rights and obligations regarding the maintenance of employee records, communication in conformity with those rights and obligations did not constitute publication for a libel suit. White v. Trew,

                        Communication Not Within Statute. - Challenge of the North Carolina Department of Transportation to the trial court's order that it failed to produce sufficient evidence of a legitimate non-retaliatory reason for discipline was nothing more than a challenge
                        to the factual determinations made by the State Personnel Commission [now the State Human Resources Commission], which were binding upon the court of appeals for purposes of appellate review because they had adequate record support;
                        the trial court would have been entitled to conclude that the employee's e-mail to his attorney did not fall within the ambit of G.S. 126-27 or that the proffered reasons were, even if facially valid, a mere pretext for retaliation
                        and not a "legitimate non-retaliatory" reason for issuing a written warning to the employee. McAdams v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 716 S.E.2d 77 (2011), review denied,

                        Failure to Follow Established Grievance Procedure. - Department of Human Resource's dismissal of employee's appeal on grounds it was filed one day after the deadline was neither arbitrary or capricious where employee was informed of the time limits for
                        perfecting appeal, offered assistance for complying with appeal procedures since legal representation was not allowed at that time of the proceeding, and employee's apparent justification for filing late was difficulty in retaining
                        an attorney. Lewis v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 737, 375 S.E.2d 712 (1989).

                        The State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides for administrative-type grievance procedures for violations of its provisions. The statute further provides that judicial review of unfavorable decisions may be had in superior
                        court. Where a statute provides for an orderly procedure for an appeal to the superior court for review, this procedure is the exclusive means for obtaining judicial review, and a civil action is only proper after all administrative
                        remedies have been exhausted. Johnson v. North Carolina DOT, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 418 S.E.2d 700 (1992).

                        Office of Administrative Hearings had subject matter jurisdiction to hear an employee's termination appeal because (1) G.S. 126-38, setting a filing deadline the employee did not meet, had been repealed, and (2) G.S. 126-34.01, requiring the employee
                        to discuss the case with a supervisor and follow an approved grievance procedure, was satisfied. Renfrow v. N.C. Dep't of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 782 S.E.2d 379 (2016).

                        Contested Case Petition Before Office of Administrative Hearings. - When a state employee successfully contested a dismissal in an informal grievance process but sought a contested case regarding implementation of the relief awarded, it was not error
                        for the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to dismiss the contested case because it was not statutorily contemplated that the OAH would resolve that issue. Carlton v. Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. App.</cite>                        530, 834 S.E.2d 636 (2019).

                        Sufficient Notice of Complaint. - Employee's memorandum, coupled with the prior history existing between the employee and the North Carolina Department of Transportation, sufficed to place the Department on notice that the employee was complaining of
                        either harassment or retaliation, or both, based on his race because the employee's communication asserted that the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] had ruled that the Department's predecessor had
                        retaliated against him, that the Department had to treat him with the same respect it showed to senior white officers, and that the employee did not believe that the deputy director circumvented the white senior officers when personnel
                        matters were being handled. McAdams v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 716 S.E.2d 77 (2011), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 558</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 599, 2012 N.C.

                        State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] Had Jurisdiction Over Complaint. - Trial court did not err by determining that an employee sufficiently complied with the requirements of G.S. 126-34 (now repealed) to vest the State Personnel
                        Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] with jurisdiction over his complaint of racially-based harassment or retaliation against the North Carolina Department of Transportation because even though the employee adequately
                        notified the Department that he claimed to have been subjected to harassment on the basis of his race, the Department failed to act on the complaint, a fact which authorized the employee to seek relief through the administrative
                        review process. McAdams v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 716 S.E.2d 77 (2011), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 558</cite>, 722 S.E.2d 599, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 146 (2012).

                        Legislative Intent. - By enacting this section, the General Assembly has indicated its intent to create grounds for appeal to the Commission through a contested case hearing only on issues for which appeal has been specifically authorized in this section.
                        Dunn v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 476 S.E.2d 383 (1996).

                        When a state employee sought review of the termination of her employment, G.S. 126-34.1(a)(2)(b) (now repealed) did not give her a right to a hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings, because her job as "instructional and research staff of
                        the University of North Carolina" was expressly exempt from the ambit of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html" target="_blank">Chapter 126</a></cite>, the State Personnel Act [now North
                        Carolina Human Resources Act], and the fact that the statute referred to state employees without adding "except those already exempted," did not require a different result. Woodburn v. N.C. State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite>                        549, 577 S.E.2d 154, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 470</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 296 (2003).

                        Construction. - Language of G.S. 126-34.1 (now repealed) of the State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] clearly and unambiguously stated that the statutory list of appeal grounds in former G.S. 126-34.1 was exclusive, and this list
                        did not provide for appeals to the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) of reductions in force (RIF) based on a lack of just cause; the North Carolina General Assembly clearly intended to deny the OAH jurisdiction over challenges
                        to RIF on procedural violation grounds and to grant state employees the right to bring only those RIF claims that were specifically set out in G.S. 126-34.1 before OAH. Univ. of N.C. at Chapel Hill v. Feinstein,

                        By its own terms of exclusion, G.S. 126-34.1 (now repealed) of the State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] superseded and controlled over any contrary earlier enactments, and given its clear and unambiguous language, the later enacted
                        former G.S. 126-34.1 supplanted G.S. 126-35. Univ. of N.C. at Chapel Hill v. Feinstein, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 590 S.E.2d 401 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 380</cite>,

                        Applicability of the just cause requirement set forth in G.S. 126-5(a)(2) is determined by the permanency of employment and not by months of service; therefore, a terminated employee who worked less than 24 months before being terminated while on medical
                        leave was entitled to file a contested case based on a lack of just cause since she had been an employee of the Department of Social Services, which was a local social services department. Early v. County of Durham Dep't of Soc.

                        Contested Case Petition Before Office of Administrative Hearings. - Employer's motion to dismiss an employee's second contested case petition was properly denied because the employee was allowed to recommence his case within one year after his voluntary
                        dismissal; before any decision was reached, the employee dismissed his claim without prejudice, and the original contested case petition had been terminated, leaving nothing in dispute and nothing for the Office of Administrative

                        When the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) dismissed a state employee's contested case seeking review of the relief the employee was awarded in an informal grievance process, the employee was not entitled to attorneys' fees because: (1) the OAH
                        did not order a remedy but dismissed the contested case; and (2) before the employee filed a contested case with the OAH, the employee had already been reinstated and awarded back pay. Carlton v. Univ. of N.C.

                        When a state employee successfully contested a dismissal in an informal grievance process but sought a contested case regarding implementation of the relief awarded, it was not error for the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to dismiss the contested

                        Prima Facie Case of Discrimination Shown. - Because the Office of Administrative Hearings had jurisdiction to hear an African-American employee's contested case of racial discrimination, the employee met his prima facie burden of discrimination, the trial
                        court applied the appropriate standard of review, and the employee presented sufficient evidence of unequal treatment of an African-American employee compared to a Caucasian employee, and established that the Hatch Act was a pretext
                        for discrimination, a finding of discrimination was upheld. Corbett v. N.C. DMV, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 660 S.E.2d 233 (2008), review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 124</cite>,

                        Reduction in Force Based on Lack of Just Cause or Procedural Violations Not Reviewable - Because under G.S. 126-34.1 (now repealed) of the State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act], the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) did not
                        have jurisdiction to determine whether employees' terminations under reductions in force were based on a lack of just cause or procedural violations, the trial court erred in holding otherwise and the employees' petitions for OAH
                        review were to be dismissed on remand. Univ. of N.C. at Chapel Hill v. Feinstein, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 590 S.E.2d 401 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 380</cite>,

                        dismiss a career state employee's claim that his reduction in force (RIF) discharge lacked just cause and was the result of procedural violations because the Feinstein case, which ruled that career state employees separated under
                        an RIF could not bring either just cause or procedural appeals based on that separation, controlled the appeal; the court of appeals was not free to revisit the prior panel's analysis, and the distinction between Feinstein and
                        the employee's case, university employees as opposed to North Carolina Department of Public Instruction employees, was immaterial to the analysis. Jailall v. N.C.

                        the State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] does not place jurisdiction over this matter with the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission]. Hodge v. North Carolina DOT,

                        for the immediate 24 preceding months and thus she was not a career State employee. Campbell v. N.C. DOT - DMV, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 575 S.E.2d 54 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 62</cite>,

                        Demotion and transfer were not politically-motivated in violation of this section where the evidence in the record failed to support a causal connection between his political affiliation and the employer's actions; petitioner admitted that the demotion
                        and transfer were not the product of any disciplinary actions but was the result of the letters he wrote requesting a transfer, and that his testimony regarding people who "played politics" was nothing more than speculation. Curtis

                        Constructive Discharge. - When an employee is "deemed to have voluntarily resigned" by the State agency for being unable or unwilling to work in conditions that may constitute discrimination, such resignation can constitute a constructive discharge entitling
                        the employee to file a contested case alleging termination pursuant to G.S. 126-34.1(a)(2)b (now repealed). Campbell v. N.C. DOT - DMV, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 575 S.E.2d 54 (2003),

                        Settlement of Administrative Action Did Not Bar Suit Under Whistleblower Act. - Agreement settling a former employee's administrative action against an agency did not estop the former employee from seeking damages under the Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84
                        et seq., because the former employee did not allege a Whistleblower Act claim in the administrative action and such remedies were not recoverable in the administrative action; the settlement agreement did not contain any release
                        of a claim under the Whistleblower Act. The former employee's acceptance of the settlement agreement and subsequent voluntary resignation did not negate the fact that the former employee's employment was terminated. Newberne v.

                        Trial court properly dismissed a judicial action brought by a former police officer under G.S. 126-86, which was commenced prior to the exhaustion of an administrative action before the Office of Administrative Hearings, that the former officer brought
                        pursuant to G.S. 126-34.1(a)(7) (now repealed), alleging retaliation and racial discrimination in violation of G.S. 126-85. Newberne v. Crime Control &amp; Pub.

                        Doctrine of administrative exhaustion did not prevent a state trooper from filing a whistleblower claim in a superior court because the state trooper had the choice to pursue the whistleblower claim in either a judicial forum, pursuant to G.S. 126-86,
                        or an administrative forum, pursuant to G.S. 126-34.1 (now repealed), but not both. Newberne v. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 782</cite>, 618 S.E.2d 201 (2005).

                        Remedy Limited to Backpay by After Acquired Evidence Doctrine. - Administrative law judge properly applied the after-acquired-evidence doctrine to a terminated career state employee and barred the employee from reinstatement and additional compensation
                        because, although a state university wrongfully terminated the employee for theft, the university would have terminated the employee immediately upon subsequently learning of the employee's failure to report criminal convictions
                        on a job application. The employee's remedy was limited to back pay from the time of the discharge to the discovery of the evidence. Brown v. Fayetteville State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. App.</cite>                        123, 837 S.E.2d 390 (2020).

                        Statute merely provided a plaintiff with "the right to appeal" a wrongful retaliation claim directly to the State Personnel Commission. G.S. 126-36(b) (now repealed), and such "right to appeal" did not otherwise bar an action which met the requirements
                        of the Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 et seq.; when G.S. 126-36(b) was read in para materia with the Whistleblower Act, the two statutes were not irreconcilable. Wells v. State DOC, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite>                        307, 567 S.E.2d 803 (2002).

                        state employee, G.S. 126-36(a) (now repealed) allowed the Commission to review his claims derived from alleged discrimination on the basis of religion. Vanderburg v. N.C.

                        Notice of Appeal. - There is no reason why notices of appeal from the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) should not be required to bear a filed and stamped verification confirming the date and time the notice of appeal was filed with OAH. Erickson

                        Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies. - Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) erroneously dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction due to the failure to exhaust administrative remedies; by refusing petitioner's timely mailed form,
                        the department prevented petitioner from obtaining a final agency decision reviewed and approved by OAH with jurisdiction to hear his contested case. Erickson v. N.C.

                        Direct Appeal Permitted. - Where in his petition for a contested case hearing, an employee had alleged termination without just cause due to discrimination and had checked the appropriate lines labeled "race" and "age," he had therefore sufficiently asserted
                        discrimination to petition directly to the State Personnel Commission. Bobbitt v. N.C. State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 743, 635 S.E.2d 463 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 350</cite>,

                        Superior court properly dismissed a university employee's petition for review of an administrative law judge's affirmation of the termination of his employment for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because an adequate procedure for judicial review by
                        direct appeal to the Court of Appeals was provided by two other statutes. Swauger v. Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 727, 817 S.E.2d 434 (2018).

                        Appeal Treated As Petition for Writ of Certiorari. - Due to Petitioner's lack of knowledge regarding the policy of the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) of not adding a file-stamp to emailed notices of appeal, and North Carolina Department of Public
                        Safety's failure to file a motion to dismiss or argue the notice of appeal was not timely filed, petitioner would suffer manifest injustice were his appeal dismissed; the court invoked the rule to treat the appeal as a petition
                        for a writ of certiorari. Erickson v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 700, 826 S.E.2d 821 (2019).

                        Untimely Appeal. - Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) had no jurisdiction to hear an employee's appeal of an alleged denial of a promotion for reporting other employees' improper acts because: (1) as a career state employee, the employee was required
                        by the statute in effect to file a Whistleblower Act claim in the OAH within 30 days after the promotion was denied, which the employee did not do, and (2) the date on which the employee's claim allegedly accrued was irrelevant.

                        Two Tests Applicable to Employment Decisions Based on Inherently Subjective Criteria. - When reviewing hiring and promotion decisions that were based on exercise of personal judgment or application of inherently subjective criteria, court may employ either
                        "disparate treatment" test or "disparate impact" test, or both. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 394 S.E.2d 285 (1990).

                        Definition of Promotion. - This section does not contain a definition of "promotion." Unless a word in a statute has acquired a technical meaning or the language of the statute indicates that a special use is intended, it must be given its "common and
                        ordinary meaning." Edwards v. University of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 421 S.E.2d 383, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 167</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 909 (1992).

                    <p>
                        The word "promotion" is not peculiar to any particular profession, but is universally used. Nothing in the text of this section indicates that the legislature sought to attach any technical meaning to its use. Edwards v. University of N.C.
                        <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 421 S.E.2d 383, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 167</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 909 (1992).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The important criteria in both the dictionary and State Personnel Commission definitions of "promotion" are greater status and a higher standing in relation to others. Accordingly, to the extent any individual's relative standing among his peers was raised
                        when the university police department reclassified ranks, that individual was promoted. Edwards v. University of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 421 S.E.2d 383, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 167</cite>,

                    <p>
                        There is no mention in the definition of promotion of increased pay or change in job classification. This definition is consistent with other states' interpretations of promotion, which recognize that salary increases and changes in job classification
                        are not the sole criteria for determining the existence of a promotion. Edwards v. University of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 421 S.E.2d 383, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 167</cite>,

                        Reorganization Held Promotion Scheme. - Although changes in rank made pursuant to a reorganization involved no increase in salary or change in state job classification, the reorganization within the university police department was a promotion scheme
                        and therefore within the appellate jurisdiction of State Personnel Commission. Edwards v. University of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 421 S.E.2d 383, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 167</cite>,

                        Racial Discrimination. - The State Personnel Commission has authority to determine whether a State employee has been discharged because of racial discrimination. Abron v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                        229, 368 S.E.2d 203 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Once employee establishes prima facie case of racial discrimination, burden shifts to the employer to produce evidence showing legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for its action. If the employer carries its burden to produce that evidence, the employee
                        must then satisfy the trier of fact that the employer's stated reasons were merely a pretext for intentional discrimination. Abron v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                        229, 368 S.E.2d 203 (1988).

                        Disparate Treatment Claims. - When employee alleges that employer treated him or her in particular less favorably than other employees, employee raises claim of "disparate treatment." North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge,
                        <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 394 S.E.2d 285 (1990).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        According to "disparate treatment" analysis, employee has initial burden of proving, by preponderance of evidence, prima facie case of discrimination. [1] He applied for and was qualified for an available position, [2] that he was rejected, and that [3]
                        after he was rejected employer filled position with white employee. Once employee establishes prima facie case, inference of discrimination arises. To rebut this inference, the employer must present evidence that employee was rejected,
                        or other applicant was chosen, for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason. Employee retains final burden of persuading jury of intentional discrimination. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite>                        602, 394 S.E.2d 285 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Pretext. - From whole record, substantial evidence supports commission's conclusion that employer's stated reasons were legitimate and not pretext for discrimination. Conversely, there is lacking substantial evidence that retaliation for past opposition
                        to discrimination was "predominant reason." Gadson v. North Carolina Mem. Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 392 S.E.2d 618 (1990).
                    </p>

                        After employer rebuts employee's prima facie showing, employee has opportunity to demonstrate that employer's proffered reasons for its decision were not its true reasons.

                        Employee may use various forms of evidence to demonstrate that state's proffered reason was not its true reason. An employee might seek to demonstrate that employer's claim to have promoted a better qualified applicant was pretextual by showing that he
                        was in fact better qualified than person chosen for position. North Carolina Dep't of Cor. v. Hodge, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 394 S.E.2d 285 (1990).

                        Evidence of Discrimination. - In considering whether the employer's stated nondiscriminatory reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination, courts may consider the evidence the employee used to establish his prima facie case as well as: (1) Evidence
                        that white employees involved in acts of comparable seriousness were retained; (2) evidence of the employer's treatment of the employee during his term of employment; (3) evidence of the employer's response to any legitimate civil
                        rights activities of the employee; and (4) evidence of the employer's general policy and practice regarding minority employees. Abron v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                        229, 368 S.E.2d 203 (1988).

                        Error in Reversing Decision on Use of Racial Epithet. - Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in reversing a final agency decision by the county department of social services to terminate an employee for her use of a racial epithet because the ALJ's finding
                        of fact regarding the employee's alleged conduct was not supported by the evidence in the record; the employee's testimony was clear and unequivocal that the phrase she used was "nigra rican" and not "Negra-Rican," as found by

                        that the applicable temporal requirement was satisfied if the petition for a contested case hearing was filed within 30 days of the date upon which the employee received notice of the decision or action which triggered the right
                        of appeal; although <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba03s150B-23ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-23(a)</a></cite> treats both the filing of the petition and the payment of the
                        required fee as necessary to permit the commencement of a contested case and although <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba03s150B-23.2" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-23.2</a></cite>(B) requires the North Carolina
                        Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) to collect any required fees at the time of the commencement of the contested case, nothing in the relevant statutory language requires the payment of the required fee simultaneously with

                        Department of Public Safety Employee. - Trial court erred in granting an aggrieved employee summary judgment on a claim that G.S. 126-34.02 was unconstitutional as applied to him where he was an employee of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety,
                        that agency was expressly exempt from the administrative hearing provisions of the APA, but the plain language of G.S. 126-5(h) provided the employee with a statutory right to a hearing before the Office of Administrative Hearings
                        as to whether he was subject to the APA, and that right allowed him to address whether his exempt designation was proper via a contested case. Vincoli v. State, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite>                        269, 792 S.E.2d 813 (2016).

                        Just Cause for Dismissal Not Shown. - Administrative law judge's (ALJ) conclusion that an agency did not establish just cause for a state employee's dismissal was upheld because (1) the ALJ did not have to defer to the agency in finding if just cause
                        existed, as the agency had the burden to show just cause, and (2) substantial evidence supported the ALJ's factual findings that the employee's unacceptable personal conduct did not warrant the sanction of dismissal, making those
                        findings binding on appeal, as the ALJ was the sole fact-finder. Harris v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 798 S.E.2d 127, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 386</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Although a university police officer's failure to file a non-criminal report, in violation of a university work rule, constituted unacceptable personal conduct, the violation did not provide just cause for his dismissal where surveillance video and other
                        evidence showed that no one was being assaulted when he arrived on the scene, a fellow officer who was privy to the information regarding the assault was issued a written warning, and the officer had a discipline-free work history.

                        Administrative law judge (ALJ) acted within her authority by determining the center failed to meet its burden to show just cause existed to warrant a state employee's suspension for unacceptable personal conduct because the ALJ examined all the facts,
                        circumstances, and equities present in the case, and the imposed written warning was within the authorized disciplinary alternatives. Peterson v. Caswell Developmental Ctr., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite>                        628, 814 S.E.2d 590 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Demotion Rather Than Dismissal Appropriate. - ALJ properly ordered that the officer be demoted instead of dismissed where he had allowed potential perpetrators to walk away, which constituted unacceptable personal conduct for which no reasonable person
                        should have expected to receive a prior warning. Whitehurst v. East Carolina Univ., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 938, 811 S.E.2d 626 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Attorneys' Fees. - Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) could award a state employee appellate attorneys' fees in an employment case because (1) OAH's authority was not statutorily limited to the administrative part of a contested case, (2) such a
                        limit would not be read into the statute, and (3) the statute expanded OAH's authority to award fees by authorizing remedies where an employee prevailed on appeal of a whistleblower grievance. Hunt v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety,
                        <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. App.</cite> 24, 830 S.E.2d 865 (2019), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 60</cite>, 832 S.E.2d 732 (2019).

                        When the Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) awarded a state employee appellate attorneys' fees in an employment case, it was not appropriate to apply the "Johnson factors" adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit to determine
                        the reasonableness of the fees because this framework had not been adopted in North Carolina. Hunt v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. App.</cite> 24, 830 S.E.2d 865 (2019), review

                        Court of appeals erred in invalidating an administrative law judge's decision to award back pay and attorneys' fees to a county department of social services employee because the judge had express statutory authority to award back pay and attorneys' fees
                        to the employee; the absence of any reference to an attorneys' fee award in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba03s150B-33ol1b11" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-33(b)(11)</a></cite>                        had no bearing upon the proper resolution of the issue of whether the judge had the authority to award attorneys' fees to the employee.

                    <p>
                        Given that a county department of social services employee was a protected employee for purposes of the North Carolina Human Resources Act, the fact that an administrative law judge was explicitly authorized to award backpay to a wrongfully discharged
                        state or local government employee conclusively resolved the issue of whether the administrative law judge had the authority to require that the employee receive backpay. Rouse v. Forsyth Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,

                        [now State Human Resources Commission], then, on appeal, that of the Office of Administrative Hearings, even when there has been no documented misconduct by the employee. Batten v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor.,

                        Focus of Review. - Although referred to as "disciplinary," the focus of review under this section is justification of the adverse departmental action, without regard to whether it is taken in response to employee conduct or in response to the vicissitudes
                        of a department's personnel needs. Batten v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 338</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 35 (1990), overruled on other grounds, Empire Power Co. v. North Carolina

                        Authority to Hear Action Brought by DOC Employee. - Among all the provisions of this article, only G.S. 126-37 (now repealed) confers upon the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] or upon the Office of Administrative Hearings
                        the jurisdiction or power to deal with an action brought by a correction employee who was reallocated pursuant to a managerial reallocation. Batten v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 338</cite>,

                        This section establishes a condition precedent that must be fulfilled by the employer before disciplinary actions are taken: The employer must provide the employee with a written statement enumerating specific acts or reasons for the disciplinary action
                        and containing a statement of the employee's appeal rights. Leiphart v. North Carolina School of Arts, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 342 S.E.2d 914 (1986).

                        Property Interest in Employment. - A terminated career state employee was entitled to the "just cause" protection of this section and was therefore imbued with a constitutionally protected property interest in his employment as the Equal Employment Opportunity
                        Officer of a state agency. Peace v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 315</cite>, 507 S.E.2d 272 (1998).

                        Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in reversing a final agency decision by the county department of social services (DSS) to terminate an employee for her use of a racial epithet because DSS met its initial burden of proving the employee engaged in
                        the conduct alleged; the employee effectively conceded whichever variant she used was improper and unacceptable, and DSS's allegations sufficiently informed her that the basis of her termination was her use of a racial epithet.

                        "Just Cause" - This section provides that no employee may be reduced in "pay or position, except for just cause"; this section does not define "just cause," but giving the words their ordinary meaning, it would include either the undertaking of a private
                        investigation of a superior or the refusal to answer questions in an investigation within a particular department. Reed v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 625, 255 S.E.2d 606 (1979).

                        The trial court correctly determined that the record lacked substantial evidence to support the Personnel Commission's conclusion that the Department of Correction had not met its burden of showing just cause for terminating correctional officer; said
                        officer's behavior in leaving his post without authorization and failing to remain alert while on duty did not only constitute "unsatisfactory job performance" but fell squarely within the category of "unacceptable personal conduct"
                        for which a DOC employee may be terminated without any prior warning. North Carolina Dep't of Correction v. McNeely, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 521 S.E.2d 730 (1999).

                        There was just cause to demote the highway patrol employee as the employee drank three beers within a short period; proceeded to drive after drinking; exceeded the speed limit; and two alco-sensor tests registered 0.09 and 0.08 alcohol concentration readings.

                        Demotion of a state Department of Correction employee was not based on the just cause of sexual harassment, where unlawful sexual harassment was defined in the Department of Correction policy as including quid pro quo or hostile environment consequences,
                        and the employee's sexual comments did not include quid pro quo or hostile environment consequences. Lewis v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 449, 570 S.E.2d 231 (2002), aff'd,

                        When an employee was demoted from his position as a prison food service supervisor, there was substantial evidence, sufficient to satisfy the requirements of G.S. 126-35(a), that he did not satisfactorily meet his job requirements, which included supervising
                        inmate workers and ensuring that the kitchen was kept in a clean and orderly fashion, and he received two written warnings concerning his poor job performance, detailing his failure to follow proper procedure and failure to maintain
                        sanitary conditions in the kitchen. Skinner v. N.C. Dep't of Corr., <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 270, 572 S.E.2d 184 (2002).

                        Summary judgment for a state agency employer in an employee's petition for review of his demotion was proper where the conduct admitted by the employee constituted "unacceptable personal conduct," and the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources
                        Commission] determined that its regulations and work rules did not contain any qualification or exception for the explanations asserted by the employee. Hilliard v. N.C.

                        fell within the definition of unacceptable personal conduct under the code. Robinson v. Univ. of N.C. Health Care Sys., <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 614, 775 S.E.2d 898 (2015).

                        Employer showed just cause for the termination of a career state employee for grossly inefficient job performance because (1) the employee was required to use good judgment and make discretionary decisions to further inmate safety, and (2) leaving an
                        inmate in handcuffs for five days with nothing to drink and no attention to the inmate's condition breached the employee's duty. Blackburn v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite>                        196, 784 S.E.2d 509 (2016).

                        Trial court erred in reversing a state agency's decision that it had just cause to terminate an employee where the testimony, pictures, and texts supported a finding that he had touched a housing services consumer sexually without her consent, engaged
                        in inappropriate text messaging with her, and failed to report some of her allegations. Barron v. Eastpointe Human Servs. LME, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 786 S.E.2d 304 (2016).

                        conduct; the employee was ultimately terminated due to his failure to correct the deficiencies found in the third written warning, which served as the current incident of unsatisfactory job performance. Cole v. N.C. Dep't of Pub.

                        Superior court did not err in determining that the state highway patrol did not have just cause to terminate a sergeant where it properly found that his conduct in driving his patrol vehicle to a party and consuming alcohol was unacceptable personal conduct
                        and was a willful violation of highway patrol policies, but termination was inconsistent with the state highway patrol's treatment of similar conduct. Moreover, the sergeant's excellent work history, tenure of service, and the
                        lack of evidence that his actions resulted in harm mitigated against a finding of just cause for termination. Warren v. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety/N.C.

                        Although there was no bright line test to determine whether a ranger's conduct established unacceptable personal conduct, and thus "just cause" for a decision by the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources to demote him and reduce
                        his pay, it was clear that the ranger's decision to use emergency devices on his vehicle and exceed posted speed limits in trying to reach his mother, who was undergoing a medical emergency, was not conduct that would give just
                        cause for such a severe penalty as demotion; the ranger's conduct did not justifiably fall under the State Personnel Commission's [now State Human Resources Commission's] regulatory definition of "unacceptable personal conduct,"

                        While an expert testified that a highway patrol officer's use of alcohol was a factor in his behavior, which included firing his firearm into the floor and ingesting sleeping pills, the expert also testified that the officer's behavior was caused by a
                        combination of alcohol, the officer's first dose of lithium, "hypomania," and his being "relatively unmedicated for his bipolar disorder;" accordingly, the challenged finding of fact was supported by substantial evidence. Neither
                        could the court conclude that the application of the rational nexus test resulted in prejudice to the Department of Crime Control and Public Safety; thus, the Department did not have just cause to dismiss the officer. Bulloch v.

                        Administrative law judge's (ALJ) conclusion that an agency did not establish just cause for a state employee's dismissal was upheld because (1) the ALJ did not have to defer to the agency in finding if just cause existed, as the agency had the burden
                        to show just cause, and (2) substantial evidence supported the ALJ's factual findings that the employee's unacceptable personal conduct did not warrant the sanction of dismissal, making those findings binding on appeal, as the
                        ALJ was the sole fact-finder. Harris v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 94, 798 S.E.2d 127, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 386</cite>, 808 S.E.2d 142, 2017 N.C.

                        Although a university police officer's failure to file a non-criminal report, in violation of a university work rule, constituted unacceptable personal conduct, the violation did not provide just cause for his dismissal where surveillance video and other
                        evidence showed that no one was being assaulted when he arrived on the scene, a fellow officer who was privy to the information regarding the assault was issued a written warning, and the officer had a discipline-free work history.

                        Administrative law judge did not commit legal error in finding no just cause for a state employee's suspension because the employee had eight years of positive employment history, and other employees were able to cover the hour she was late one day, resulting
                        in no negative impact to the operation of a development center or the care of its residents; pursuant to the center's policy, the employee was never "absent" from work but merely tardy. Peterson v. Caswell Developmental Ctr.,

                    <p>
                        Administrative law judge (ALJ) acted within her authority by determining the center failed to meet its burden to show just cause existed to warrant a state employee's suspension for unacceptable personal conduct because the ALJ examined all the facts,
                        circumstances, and equities present in the case, and the imposed written warning was within the authorized disciplinary alternatives. Peterson v. Caswell Developmental Ctr., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite>                        628, 814 S.E.2d 590 (2018).

                        Where petitioner made no application for leave without pay and respondent placed him involuntarily on sick leave until his accumulated time elapsed, then required him to expend his accumulated vacation, and finally placed him on leave without pay, this
                        was, in essence, a suspension, which could not be made without just cause. White v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 521, 451 S.E.2d 876 (1995).

                        Failure to Perform with Reasonable Care Essential to Just Cause. - Standard of employee conduct implied in every contract of employment is one of reasonable care, diligence and attention. A State employee does not undertake any greater duty. In attempting
                        to establish that it had just cause to terminate an employee, an agency is bound to make a showing that the employee has not performed with reasonable care, diligence and attention. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources,

                        Failure to fulfill certain quotas and complete certain tasks to the complete satisfaction of a supervisor is not enough to establish just cause. The agency must show that quotas and job requirements were reasonable, and if so, that the employee made no
                        reasonable effort to meet them. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 397 S.E.2d 350 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 98</cite>,

                        Failure to Carry Out Supervisor's Directives. - Adequacy of an employee's work must be, to some extent, a subjective determination made by agency personnel. When an agency seeks to establish before the Commission that an employee was terminated for just
                        cause, however, it cannot rest solely on the grounds that his supervisor's directives were not carried out to their fullest extent. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C.

                        Where State employees were putting in extra effort to attempt to meet supervisor's requirements, which failed to take into account many realities of school caseload, and where there was nothing in the record which would indicate that the inability of
                        the employees to meet the supervisor's goals adversely affected the agency in any way, and where findings indicated that the employer's clients were well served by each employee, the trial court correctly concluded that the Commission's
                        own findings did not support its conclusion that just cause was established. Walker v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 397 S.E.2d 350 (1990), cert.

                        Demotion and Transfer Were Not Done Without Just Cause. - Demotion and transfer were not done without just cause where the petitioner had specifically asked for a transfer back to the town where he had been originally working and expressed a willingness,
                        however begrudgingly, to accept a demotion if that was required. Curtis v. North Carolina DOT, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 537 S.E.2d 498 (2000).

                        Contested Action Deemed "Disciplinary" Within Meaning of This Section. - Petitioner's allegation that he had been "demoted in rank without sufficient cause" stated grounds for his department's action to be deemed "disciplinary" within the meaning and
                        intent of this section and for his case to be considered "contested" within the meaning and intent of G.S. 126-37(a) (now repealed). Because he had properly pursued all informal procedures mandated by the State Personnel Act [now
                        North Carolina Human Resources Act] and by the North Carolina Administrative Code for the resolution of his grievance, petitioner's appeal also fit the procedural profile of a "contested case" for purposes of its review by the

        Discharge of Exempt Employees by Successor Governor.
       </b> - Although the North Carolina State Personnel Act [now North Carolina Human Resources Act] provides that no permanent employee subject thereto shall be discharged, suspended or reduced in pay or position except for
                        just cause, the act exempts certain employees by its terms and allows the Governor to designate as exempt from the provisions of the act certain other policy-making or decision-making employees. Where plaintiffs having a position
                        designated as policy-making or confidential by the previous Governor brought suit alleging that each was discharged from an exempt government position for the sole reason of political affiliation, there was a presumption that successor
                        Governor's actions were proper if done for political patronage reasons that require, as a qualification for the performance of a job, a political affiliation. Stott v. Haworth, 916 F.2d 134 (4th Cir. 1990).

                        After Acquired Evidence Doctrine. - Administrative law judge properly applied the after-acquired-evidence doctrine to a terminated career state employee and barred the employee from reinstatement and additional compensation because, although a state university
                        wrongfully terminated the employee for theft, the university would have terminated the employee immediately upon subsequently learning of the employee's failure to report criminal convictions on a job application. The employee's
                        remedy was limited to back pay from the time of the discharge to the discovery of the evidence. Brown v. Fayetteville State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 837 S.E.2d 390 (2020).

                        Administrator received the notification mandated by G.S. 126-35 in an administrative proceeding concerning the administrator's dismissal from employment at a State facility for the mentally retarded; as the administrator received a dismissal letter which
                        set forth the specific acts or omissions supporting his dismissal, as well as his appeal rights, and the fact that this notice was given simultaneously with the disciplinary action in this case was not a violation of G.S. 126-35.

                        Duty of State Agencies to Describe "Specific Acts or Omissions" with Particularity. - This section imposes an affirmative duty on State agencies to inform discharged employees, in writing, of the "specific acts or omissions" that were the reasons for
                        the disciplinary action; "specific acts or omissions" implies that these incidents should be described with sufficient particularity so that the discharged employee will know precisely what acts or omissions were the basis of his
                        discharge. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 274 S.E.2d 256 (1981).

                        Notice Held Inadequate. - The Employment Security Commission failed to give respondent proper notice of the reasons for his dismissal as an employee as required by this section where the only information given respondent concerning the reasons for his
                        dismissal was contained in the letter of dismissal, which stated that respondent violated agency procedure in attempting to recruit migrant workers from Florida by phone and personal visit, that respondent had forced workers to
                        work for a designated crew leader even though the workers preferred not to work in a crew, and that respondent violated agency procedure by not reporting illegal aliens, since the letter did not describe any incidents with sufficient
                        particularity so that respondent could know precisely what acts or omissions were the basis of his discharge. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. Wells, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 274 S.E.2d 256

                        Although the Department of Human Resources' original notice to petitioner clearly stated the specific acts underlying its decision to take a particular disciplinary action, i.e., dismissal, the secretary's subsequent notice that her decision to demote
                        petitioner was "based upon the information presented" was not an adequate statement of the specific acts or omissions underlying her decision to take a different disciplinary action, i.e., demotion. Meyers v. Department of Human

                        Warnings Required. - Where petitioner's performance of his duties as a wildlife officer were what had become accepted standards of reporting and performing his work, disciplinary action by petitioner's supervisors to halt these accepted standards would
                        have propelled this behavior into the "unsatisfactory job performance" category rather than the "unacceptable personal conduct" category, for which certain warnings were required before petitioner's termination on the grounds of
                        unsatisfactory job performance. Wilkie v. North Carolina Wildlife Resources Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 455 S.E.2d 871 (1995).

                        Written Statement of Appeal Rights Required. - Due process under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions requires that a permanent State employee who has been dismissed be provided with a statement in writing setting forth his rights of appeal
                        before the 15- and 30-day time limits for notice of appeal provided in this section and G.S. 126-38 (now repealed) commence to run. Luck v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite>                        192, 272 S.E.2d 607 (1980).

                        Impartial Decision Maker. - A public employee facing an administrative hearing is entitled to an impartial decision maker. However, to make out a due process claim based on this theory, an employee must show that the decision making board or individual
                        possesses a disqualifying personal bias. Leiphart v. North Carolina School of Arts, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 342 S.E.2d 914 (1986).

                        Dean's consultation with members of the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission] prior to dismissing petitioner could not be said to have deprived him of an impartial hearing where petitioner failed to show any disqualifying personal
                        bias on the part of the decision makers because of familiarity with the facts of his case. Leiphart v. North Carolina School of Arts, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 342 S.E.2d 914 (1986).

                        Failure to Follow Established Grievance Procedure. - Department of Human Resource's dismissal of employee's appeal on grounds it was filed one day after the deadline was neither arbitrary or capricious where employee was informed of the time limits for
                        perfecting appeal, offered assistance for complying with appeal procedures since legal representation was not allowed at that time of the proceeding, and employee's apparent justification for filing late was difficulty in retaining
                        an attorney. Lewis v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 737, 375 S.E.2d 712 (1989).

                        School's failure to follow its internal review process did not automatically entitle petitioner to reversal of dismissal determination. In order to claim any relief based on a violation of internal appeal procedures, petitioner would have had to show
                        that there was a substantial chance there would have been a different result in his case if the established internal procedures had been followed. Leiphart v. North Carolina School of Arts, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                        339, 342 S.E.2d 914 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Make Proper Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law. - Case was remanded because the final decision did not indicate that the conduct of a technician who worked for a county department of social services amounted to unacceptable personal conduct,
                        and no conclusion of law asserted the department had substantive just cause for any disciplinary action; the ALJ had to make findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding whether the conduct was unacceptable personal conduct,
                        and whether it amounted to just cause for the disciplinary action taken. Watlington v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. Rockingham Cnty., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 799 S.E.2d 396 (2017), overruled

                        Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) erred in reversing a final agency decision by the county department of social services to terminate an employee for her use of a racial epithet because the ALJ's finding of fact regarding the employee's alleged conduct was
                        not supported by the evidence in the record; the employee's testimony was clear and unequivocal that the phrase she used was "nigra rican" and not "Negra-Rican," as found by the ALJ. Ayers v. Currituck Cty. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,

                        Discretion to Consider Full Range of Punishment. - Petitioner was dismissed from the North Carolina State Highway Patrol for alleged violations of the Patrol's truthfulness policy, but because the colonel did not understand that he had discretion to consider
                        the full range of potential discipline, his decision was affected by an error of law; under the flexible definition of just cause, the colonel had discretion in dismissing an employee for violating the policy, and while dismissal
                        may be reasonable for dishonest conduct, the better practice would be to allow for a range of disciplinary actions in response to an individual act of untruthfulness, rather than a categorical approach. Wetherington v. N.C. Dep't

                        Motion In Limine Properly Denied. - It was no error to deny a career state employee's motion in limine to limit termination hearing evidence to reasons stated in the employee's dismissal letter because (1) the employee's prior discipline was relevant
                        to the level of discipline imposed, and (2) the employee was not entitled to notice of all evidence related to the acts and omissions of which the employee was given notice. Blackburn v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety,

                        Substantial Evidence. - Substantial evidence supported an administrative law judge's factual findings in support of a recommendation to terminate a career state employee because the evidence showed the employee (1) left an inmate in handcuffs despite
                        not regarding the inmate as a threat, (2) did not ensure the inmate was monitored, (3) did not complete reports, and (4) did not accept personal responsibility. Blackburn v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety,

                        directors to discuss complaints about their superior, the Dean of Student Services, in the absence of the Dean, would be upheld. Leiphart v. North Carolina School of Arts, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite>                        339, 342 S.E.2d 914 (1986).

                        Dismissal of State Bureau of Investigation (SBI) agent for failure to comply with five day deadline for SBI agents to file reports was reasonable where the rule was promulgated for the purpose of providing timely written reports to district attorneys,
                        to aid in prosecution, and to enhance the credibility of the testimony of SBI agents and the rule also provided that for legitimate reasons, the five day requirement could be extended. Gainey v. North Carolina Dep't of Justice,

                        State Personnel Commissioner [now Director of the Office of State Human Resources] did not err in affirming dismissal based on warnings that occurred two years prior to the actual dismissal, especially when the earlier violations related to the very reasons

                        Substantial evidence supported an administrative law judge's (ALJ) ruling that the North Carolina Department of Transportation (DOT) had just cause to dismiss an employee for unacceptable personal conduct where he knowingly violated the DOT's Statement
                        of Understanding and Internet Policy as: (1) the employee's denial of knowledge of the Statement of Understanding was not credible, (2) the employee's claim that he was unaware that he had to obtain his supervisor's approval before
                        installing software on his work computer was not believed by the ALJ, (3) the employee admitted not having permission to install software on his computer, and (4) the unauthorized installation of software was inconsistent with
                        the DOT's objective to ensure that its files and computer network system were properly protected. Teague v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 628 S.E.2d 395 (2006), cert. denied,

                        Trial court did not err in affirming the State Personnel Commission's [now State Human Resources Commission's] decision and order adopting the findings of fact of a North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings administrative law judge (ALJ) because

                        Trial court did not err in affirming the State Personnel Commission's [now State Human Resources Commission's] decision to grant a former employer summary judgment because a former employee was dismissed for violating one of the employer's rules and for
                        her treatment of the co-worker, and she did not assert any issue of fact regarding her behavior towards the co-worker or argue that her treatment of the co-worker, standing alone, did not constitute just cause for her dismissal;
                        the employee did not deny the violation of the employer's rule and did not argue that willful violation of the rule failed to constitute just cause for dismissal. Woodard v.

                        North Carolina State Highway Patrol did not act arbitrarily or capriciously when it dismissed a state trooper because just cause existed, pursuant to G.S. 126-35, to support the trooper's termination from the Highway Patrol because the trooper engaged
                        in unacceptable personal conduct by having an extramarital affair over a period of years and engaging in sexual conduct during the affair in a patrol car, behind a patrol car, and in a Highway Patrol office while in uniform. Furthermore,
                        other Highway Patrol officers were terminated for similar misconduct. Poarch v. N.C. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 741 S.E.2d 315 (2012), review

                        Office of Administrative Hearings erred in granting summary judgment in favor of a career state employee because the employer met the procedural statutory requirements prior to dismissing the employee, the employee was not deprived of her ability to prepare
                        an effective representation or effectively appeal her discharge, and did not meet her burden of showing that her dismissal was based on discrimination inasmuch as she was placed on a performance improvement plan, participated in
                        ongoing progress meetings where she received feedback, guidance, and counseling, received two detailed warnings, a pre-dismissal letter, and a dismissal letter, all of which described in sufficient detail the employee's unsatisfactory

                        In a case where the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (DPI) dismissed a career State employee, the final decision of the administrative law judge upholding the employee's dismissal for just cause was affirmed because the employee engaged
                        in conduct unbecoming of a State employee that was detrimental to State service by becoming involved in a loud confrontation with a female colleague, which resulted in her believing that the employee had harassed her and had created
                        a hostile work environment for female employees; he engaged in inappropriate conduct during a potential employee's interview; and the employee displayed a pattern of petulant, inappropriate, and insubordinate behavior that extended
                        over the course of several years. Smith v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Instruction, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. App.</cite> 430, 820 S.E.2d 561 (2018).

                        Purpose of Act to Protect State Employee From Retaliation for Truthful Reporting, Not to Condone Untruthful Conduct. - Trial court properly granted a motion to dismiss by state agencies and officials of a former law enforcement officer's action under
                        the Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 et seq., where the officer admitted that he failed to file a complete and accurate report of an arrest incident that he observed involving another trooper and a suspect, wherein excessive force
                        was suspected; the purpose of the Whistleblower Act was to protect a state employee from retaliation when he engaged in truthful reporting, not to condone untruthful conduct. Newberne v. Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety,

                        Construction with Other Statutes. - G.S. 126-36(b) (now repealed) merely provided a plaintiff with "the right to appeal" a wrongful retaliation claim directly to the State Personnel Commission [now State Human Resources Commission]. and such "right to
                        appeal" did not otherwise bar an action which met the requirements of the Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 et seq.; when former G.S. 126-36(b) was read in para materia with the Whistleblower Act, the two statutes are not irreconcilable.

                        Jurisdiction. - When an employee alleged the employee was terminated in violation of North Carolina's Whistleblower Act, a trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to administrative proceedings below because the claim was dismissed at
                        the administrative level for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, so administrative jurisdiction was never acquired, and the doctrine of administrative exhaustion did not bar the suit. Hodge v. N.C. DOT,

                        Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) had no jurisdiction to hear an employee's appeal of an alleged denial of a promotion for reporting other employees' improper acts because, (1) as a career state employee, the employee was required by the statute
                        in effect to file a Whistleblower Act claim in the OAH within 30 days after the promotion was denied, which the employee did not do, and (2) the date on which the employee's claim allegedly accrued was irrelevant. Brown v. N.C.

                        Applicability. - Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through G.S. 126-88, applied to a University of North Carolina research scientist because G.S. 126-5(c5) excluded the Whistleblower Act from the exemption in G.S. 126-5(c1)(8). Yan-Min Wang v. UNC-CH Sch.

                        Burden of Proof. - Even if it were assumed arguendo that a former employee established a prima facie claim of retaliation, the employee's suit against corrections officials was properly disposed through summary judgment because the officials articulated
                        some legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for terminating the employee's employment with a correctional facility, but the employee failed to show that the given reasons were pretextual. Sivaramalingam Manickavasagar v. N.C. Dep't
                        of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 767 S.E.2d 652 (2014).

                        Trial court properly granted the university and supervisor summary judgment on a whistleblower claim where the issues that ultimately prompted the university to terminate employment arose around 18 months prior to an internal audit investigation, the
                        employee had not shown any improvement despite being given an opportunity to do so and, thus, the employee failed to establish a causal connection between her protected activity and her termination. Hubbard v. N.C. State Univ.,

                        When an employee alleged the employee was terminated in violation of North Carolina's Whistleblower Act, the employer was entitled to summary judgment because the employee's alleged circumstantial evidence showed the employer's reason for firing the employee
                        was pretextual, but the employee did not point to specific, non-speculative facts, beyond that required to state a prima facie case, discrediting the employer's non-retaliatory motive. Hodge v. N.C. DOT,
                        <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 455, 784 S.E.2d 594 (2016).

                        Burden of Persuasion. - Claims brought under the North Carolina Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through 126-88, should be adjudicated according to the following procedures: (1) the plaintiff must endeavor to establish a prima facie case of retaliation
                        under the statute, the plaintiff should include any available direct evidence that the adverse employment action was retaliatory along with circumstantial evidence to that effect; (2) the defendant should present its case, including
                        its evidence as to legitimate reasons for the employment decision; and (3) once all the evidence has been received, the court should determine whether the McDonnell Douglas or Price Waterhouse framework properly applies to the
                        evidence before it. If the plaintiff has demonstrated that he or she engaged in a protected activity and the defendant took adverse action against the plaintiff in his or her employment, and if the plaintiff has further established
                        by direct evidence that the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment action, then the defendant bears the burden to show that its legitimate reason, standing alone, would have induced it
                        to make the same decision; if, however, the plaintiff has failed to satisfy the Price Waterhouse threshold, the case should be decided under the principles enunciated in McDonnell Douglas and Burdine, with the plaintiff bearing
                        the burden of persuasion on the ultimate issue whether the employment action was taken for retaliatory purposes. Newberne v. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 782</cite>,

                        Protected Activity. - Terminated employee's conduct in disclosing confidential patient information was not a protected activity under the North Carolina Whistle-blower Act, G.S. 126-84 et seq. Holt v. Albemarle Reg'l Health Servs. Bd.,

                        Administrative record was insufficient to determine whether a university research scientist engaged in protected activity when she reported to her employer that there was a problem with the mouse population his lab was using because the agency did not
                        make factual findings explaining its conclusory statement that there was no retaliation and that the scientist's employment was not continued because of a personality conflict. Yan-Min Wang v. UNC-CH Sch. of Med.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 185, 716 S.E.2d 646 (2011).

                        Doctor's claim of being fired from a correctional institution in retaliation for reporting discrimination based on race or national origin was without merit because, based on statements by the doctor, it was clear that the doctor did not believe that
                        the doctor was ever discriminated against at the institution because of race or national origin. As such, a letter by the doctor did not involve reporting racial discrimination, and instead constituted an employee grievance matter,
                        which was not a protected activity. Sivaramalingam Manickavasagar v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 767 S.E.2d 652 (2014).

                        Sufficiency of Complaint. - State trooper's claim for wrongful termination in violation of the North Carolina Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through 126-88, was wrongfully dismissed where the trooper, who alleged that the actual reason for his termination
                        was his disclosure of a possible abuse of authority in an amended statement that corrected a possibly misleading statement, stated a claim for relief under G.S. 126-84(a). Newberne v. Dep't of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety,
                        <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 782</cite>, 618 S.E.2d 201 (2005).

                        Trial court properly dismissed for failure to state a claim a former employee's complaint alleging that a university and its chancellor violated the Whistleblower Act by unlawfully retaliating against her, discriminating against her, and discharging her
                        for her refusal to carry out the chancellor's directive to pay a member of the university's board of trustees $10,000 from university funds to obtain an option to purchase real property because the employee's complaint failed to
                        sufficiently allege that she was engaged in a protected activity within the meaning of the Act, G.S. 126-84; that the university could or could not have had the funds in the future to exercise the option at the time it was purchased
                        did not affect the option's value, and that the employee did not anticipate acquiring sufficient funds to exercise the option before its expiration also did not affect the option's value. Helm v. Appalachian State Univ.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 670 S.E.2d 571 (2008).

                    <p>
                        Earlier Suit Was Not Basis for Claim Under Whistleblower Act. - Employee was not entitled to seek relief for alleged employment retaliation under the Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84, on the theory that his earlier suit seeking reinstatement into his former
                        position constituted reporting to "another appropriate authority" since the earlier suit did not concern matters affecting general public policy. Hodge v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite>                        110, 622 S.E.2d 702 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 533</cite>, 633 S.E.2d 816 (2006).

                    <p>
                        Settlement of Administrative Action Did Not Bar Suit Under Whistleblower Act. - Agreement settling a former employee's administrative action against an agency did not estop the former employee from seeking damages under the Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84
                        et seq., because the former employee did not allege a Whistleblower Act claim in the administrative action and such remedies were not recoverable in the administrative action; the settlement agreement did not contain any release
                        of a claim under the Whistleblower Act. The former employee's acceptance of the settlement agreement and subsequent voluntary resignation did not negate the fact that the former employee's employment was terminated. Newberne v.

                        Claim for Conversation Failed. - Trial court erred by failing to grant summary judgment to the North Carolina Department of Correction (NCDOC) and one of its officials in a suit brought by a correctional officer asserting claims for conversion, a violation
                        of 42 U.S.C.S.
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 1983, and violations of North Carolina's Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through G.S. 126-88, as the conversion claim was barred by sovereign immunity since it was an intentional tort; the 42 U.S.C.S.
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 1983 claim was barred since neither the State nor its officials could be liable for monetary damages under

    §
   </span> 1983; and, as to his whistleblower claims, the officer's reassignment to a different post was not shown to be a demotion since he failed to show that his reassignment resulted in a pay loss of any kind and, based on
                        his own testimony, his resignation was not an employment action relevant to the claim since he only told one person affiliated with the NCDOC about his intent to resign, and that person tried to discourage the same. Demurry v.

                        Adequate State Remedy. - Former employee did not adequately allege a free speech claim, an equal protection claim, and an exclusive emoluments claim when she had an adequate state remedy for those violations because the employee's claim under the Whistleblower
                        Act, G.S. 126-86, was an adequate state law remedy for her alleged free speech violation, her claim of misappropriation of state funds was expressly covered by the Act, G.S. 126-84, and thus was an adequate state law remedy for
                        her exclusive emoluments clause claim; because the employee's equal protection claim alleged discrimination based on activities protected by the Whistleblower Act, it was also precluded. Helm v. Appalachian State Univ.,

                        Exhaustion of Remedies. - Trial court properly dismissed a judicial action brought by a former police officer under G.S. 126-86, which was commenced prior to the exhaustion of an administrative action before the Office of Administrative Hearings, that
                        the former officer brought pursuant to G.S. 126-34.1(a)(7) (now repealed), alleging retaliation and racial discrimination in violation of G.S. 126-85. Newberne v.

                        When an employee alleged the employee was terminated in violation of North Carolina's Whistleblower Act, a trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction due to administrative proceedings below because the claim was dismissed at the administrative
                        level for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, so administrative jurisdiction was never acquired, and the doctrine of administrative exhaustion did not bar the suit. Hodge v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite>                        455, 784 S.E.2d 594 (2016).

                        Interest on Backpay Award Not Allowed. - Superior court erred when it awarded a terminated state employee interest on a backpay award, which was entered after a jury rendered a verdict for the employee on his retaliation claim under G.S. 126-85(a) because
                        pursuant to 25 N.C. Admin. Code 1B.0425, North Carolina could not be required to pay interest on any backpay award. Brookshire v. N.C. DOT, DMV, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 637 S.E.2d

                        Summary Judgment Appropriate. - Where although plaintiff's complaint contained allegations of Whistleblower violations, plaintiff's concessions made it clear that certain defendants committed no violations of the Whistleblower Act, the trial court should
                        have granted summary judgment on these claims. Minneman v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. App.</cite> 616, 442 S.E.2d 564 (1994).

                    <p>
                        Where defendant's motion for summary judgment was amply supported by evidence establishing a legitimate reason for plaintiff's transfer to a substantially similar job, and plaintiff failed to meet her burden of coming forward with a showing that defendant's
                        stated reasons were not simply a pretext for discrimination, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant. Kennedy v.

                        Trial court properly granted summary judgment for the university and university officials on a campus police officer's claim that the officer was disciplined in retaliation for refusing to withdraw a citation issued to a university trustee's child; the

                        Trial court erred by failing to grant summary judgment to the North Carolina Department of Correction (NCDOC) and one of its officials in a suit brought by a correctional officer asserting claims for conversion, a violation of 42 U.S.C.S.

                        his own testimony, his resignation was not an employment action relevant to the claim since he only told one person affiliated with the NCDOC about his intent to resign, and that person tried to discourage the same. Demurry v.

                        When an employee alleged the employee was terminated in violation of North Carolina's Whistleblower Act, the employer was entitled to summary judgment because the employee's alleged circumstantial evidence showed the employer's reason for firing the employee
                        was pretextual, but the employee did not point to specific, non-speculative, facts, beyond that required to state a prima facie case, discrediting the employer's non-retaliatory motive. Hodge v. N.C. DOT,

                        Motion to Dismiss Properly Granted. - Trial court properly dismissed for failure to state a claim a former employee's complaint alleging that a university and its chancellor violated the Whistleblower Act by unlawfully retaliating against her, discriminating
                        against her, and discharging her for her refusal to carry out the chancellor's directive to pay a member of the university's board of trustees $10,000 from university funds to obtain an option to purchase real property because
                        the employee's complaint failed to sufficiently allege that she was engaged in a protected activity within the meaning of the Act, G.S. 126-84; that the university could or could not have had the funds in the future to exercise
                        the option at the time it was purchased did not affect the option's value, and that the employee did not anticipate acquiring sufficient funds to exercise the option before its expiration also did not affect the option's value.

                        Office of Administrative Hearings (OAH) had no jurisdiction to hear an employee's appeal of an alleged denial of a promotion for reporting other employees' improper acts because, (1) as a career state employee, the employee was required by the statute
                        in effect to file a Whistleblower Act claim in the OAH within 30 days after the promotion was denied, which the employee did not do, and (2) the date on which the employee's claim allegedly accrued was irrelevant. Brown v. N.C.

                        Motion to Dismiss Improperly Granted. - State trooper's claim for wrongful termination in violation of the North Carolina Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through 126-88, was wrongfully dismissed for failure to state a cause of action because the trooper,
                        who alleged that the actual reason for his termination was his disclosure of a possible abuse of authority in an amended statement that corrected a possibly misleading statement, stated a claim for relief under G.S. 126-84(a).

        No Private Cause of Action.
       </b> - The plain language of G.S. 126-85 addresses only state employees and agencies, and nothing in the Whistleblower Act indicates that it was intended to serve as public policy for the public at large; thus, the Act did
                        not create a private cause of action for a former at-will employee's wrongful termination action against his private employer and corporate officers. Hardin v. Belmont Textile Mach., Co., - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. Aug. 3, 2006),

                        Employee Grievance Not A Protected Activity. - Doctor's claim of being fired from a correctional institution in retaliation for reporting discrimination based on race or national origin was without merit because, based on statements by the doctor, it
                        was clear that the doctor did not believe that the doctor was ever discriminated against at the institution because of race or national origin. As such, a letter by the doctor did not involve reporting racial discrimination, and
                        instead constituted an employee grievance matter, which was not a protected activity. Sivaramalingam Manickavasagar v. N.C. Dep't of Pub. Safety, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 418, 767 S.E.2d

                        Retaliatory Firing Not Shown. - Where the evidence was that there were questions regarding the adequacy of plaintiff's performance, of which plaintiff had knowledge, even before his reports and the nonappointment was based on the plaintiff's inability
                        to collaborate with others the evidence was simply too speculative to support a finding that the plaintiff's nonrenewal was in any way related to the report. Aune v.

                        Superior court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendants' motions for a directed verdict and for a judgment notwithstanding a jury's verdict because the fired state employee who filed the suit against defendants presented sufficient evidence
                        to support submitting his retaliation claim under G.S. 126-85 to the jury; the employee presented more than a mere scintilla of evidence showing that he had engaged in protected activity by participating in a state investigation
                        of his state agency employer, that he was terminated after his supervisors learned of that activity, and that the activity was a substantial or motivating factor in his termination. Brookshire v. N.C. DOT, DMV,

                        was not a protected activity under the North Carolina Whistle-blower Act, G.S. 126-84 et seq.; alternatively, the employee failed to raise a factual issue as to whether the reason given for the termination of the employee's employment

Swain v. Elfland, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. App.</cite>                        383, 550 S.E.2d 530, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 228</cite>, 554 S.E.2d 832 (2001).

                        Doctrine of administrative exhaustion did not prevent a state trooper from filing a whistleblower claim in a superior court because the state trooper had the choice to pursue the whistleblower claim in either a judicial forum, pursuant to G.S. 126-86,
                        or an administrative forum, pursuant to G.S. 126-34.1, but not both. Additionally, the trooper, while he requested an administrative hearing on an issue, did not request a hearing on his whistleblower claim. Newberne v. Dep't of

                        Conversation Claim Failed. - Trial court erred by failing to grant summary judgment to the North Carolina Department of Correction (NCDOC) and one of its officials in a suit brought by a correctional officer asserting claims for conversion, a violation
                        of 42 U.S.C.S.
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 1983, and violations of North Carolina's Whistleblower Act, G.S. 126-84 through G.S. 126-88, as the conversion claim was barred by sovereign immunity since it was an intentional tort; the 42 U.S.C.S.
                        <span class="s2">
    §
   </span> 1983 claim was barred since neither the State nor its officials could be liable for monetary damages under

    §
   </span> 1983; and, as to his whistleblower claims, the officer's reassignment to a different post was not shown to be a demotion since he failed to show that his reassignment resulted in a pay loss of any kind and, based on
                        his own testimony, his resignation was not an employment action relevant to the claim since he only told one person affiliated with the NCDOC about his intent to resign, and that person tried to discourage the same. Demurry v.

                        Adequate State Remedy. - Former employee did not adequately allege a free speech claim, an equal protection claim, and an exclusive emoluments claim when she had an adequate state remedy for those violations because the employee's claim under the Whistleblower
                        Act, G.S. 126-86, was an adequate state law remedy for her alleged free speech violation, her claim of misappropriation of state funds was expressly covered by the Act, G.S. 126-84, and thus was an adequate state law remedy for
                        her exclusive emoluments clause claim; because the employee's equal protection claim alleged discrimination based on activities protected by the Whistleblower Act, it was also precluded. Helm v. Appalachian State Univ.,

                        Interest on Backpay Award Not Allowed. - Superior court erred when it awarded a terminated state employee interest on a backpay award, which was entered after a jury rendered a verdict for the employee on his retaliation claim under G.S. 126-85(a) because
                        pursuant to 25 N.C. Admin. Code 1B.0425, North Carolina could not be required to pay interest on any backpay award. Brookshire v. N.C. DOT, DMV, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 670, 637 S.E.2d
