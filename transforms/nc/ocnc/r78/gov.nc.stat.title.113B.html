                    are not being performed currently, the economic potential or impact of energy storage deployment in North Carolina, and the identification of existing policies and recommended policy changes that may be considered to address a statewide
                    coordinated energy storage policy. The Collaboratory shall provide the results of this study no later than December 1, 2018, to the Energy Policy Council and the Joint Legislative Commission on Energy Policy."

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2013-365, s. 10, provides: "G.S. 113B-30, enacted by Section 6 of this act, becomes effective only if authorized by the General Assembly in the Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act
                    of 2013. The first report due pursuant to G.S. 113B-12, as amended by Section 8(m) of this act, shall be transmitted on or before January 1, 2014. Except as otherwise provided, the remainder of this act is effective when it becomes
                    law." The Revisor of Statutes is informed that no appropriation was made in the 2013 Regular Session; consequently, this section is not effective.
