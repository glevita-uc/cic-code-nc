      <p>
       Subsection (c) Unconstitutional.
   
   - Subsection (c) of this section and G.S. 1C-1603(e)(2), as they attempt to limit the claiming of constitutional exemptions to 20 days after notice to designate is served, are unconstitutional. HFC v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 262, 419 S.E.2d 592, aff'd per curiam, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 786</cite>, 429 S.E.2d 716 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative Intent.
   
   - There is no clear indication in G.S. 1C-1601 through 1C-1604 that the General Assembly intended to repeal any statutes other than G.S. 1-369 through 1-392. Therefore, to find that G.S. 1C-1601 through 1C-1604 precludes the exemption granted by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.135.html#t135a01s135-9" target="_blank">G.S. 135-9</a></cite> would be to determine that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.135.html#t135a01s135-9" target="_blank">G.S. 135-9</a></cite> has been repealed by implication. Repeal by implication is not favored in North Carolina. In re Hare, 32 Bankr. 16 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina General Assembly's purpose in enacting G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9) was to protect a debtor's right to receive retirement benefits and not to limit the exemption to a specific class of retirement plans or trusts. Rather than give a blanket exemption to all "retirement" plans, the General Assembly limited the exemption to any retirement tool that was treated in the same manner as an individual retirement plan under the Internal Revenue Code. In re Grubbs, 325 B.R. 151 (Bankr. M.D.N.C. 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Construction of Section.
       </b>
       - The general rule is that North Carolina's exemption laws are to be liberally construed in favor of the exemption. In re Laues, 90 Bankr. 158 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the primary purpose of a bond is to provide a source of funds to be applied to the satisfaction of a valid judgment, as a matter of public policy, a party is not permitted to post a cash bond to stay execution of a money judgment and then avoid forfeiture of the bond after default by claiming debtor's exemptions. Barrett v. Barrett, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 264, 468 S.E.2d 264 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9) only references the Internal Revenue Code to clarify what retirement accounts are covered by the creditor exemption, North Carolina law governs the resolution of this issue. Kinlaw v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 689 S.E.2d 428 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9) does not contain any language evincing an intent on the part of the General Assembly to treat withdrawals from Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) differently than funds held within IRAs because the plain language of G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9) states that IRAs are exempt from judgment; not only are the IRAs themselves exempt, but a defendant's legal use of the IRAs, in the same manner as if there were no judgment against him or her, is also exempt. Kinlaw v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 689 S.E.2d 428 (2009).
      </p>
      <p>
       It is instructive that G.S. 1C-1601 does not reference any party that was not compensated for personal injury; to be sure, the statute only contemplates the recipient of the personal injury compensation. The General Assembly's use of the word "retain" demonstrates that the exemption is only applicable to the injured party who received the compensation. In re Latell, - Bankr. - (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Nov. 26, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal injury compensation exemption listed in G.S. 1C-1601(a)(8) does not extend to property purchased with that compensation, and the male debtor was not entitled to the exemption in the real property. In re Latell, - Bankr. - (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Nov. 26, 2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Construction with G.S.
   
   1-362 - G.S. 1-362 does not incorporate the exemptions of G.S. 1C-1601 by reference. Kroh v. Kroh, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 198, 571 S.E.2d 643 (2002).
      </p>

        Exemption for Tenancies by the Entireties Not Eliminated by Section.
       </b>
       - The legislature, by the passage of this section, did not alter or eliminate the exemption from North Carolina process of tenancy by the entireties. The legislative history reflects that the General Assembly considered eliminating, altering, and limiting tenancy by the entirety. However, the statute which was enacted does not mention tenancy by the entirety in any way. Thus, the General Assembly did not intend to alter the common law doctrine of tenancy by the entirety but to leave it in full force and effect. In re Banks, 22 Bankr. 891 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the exemption under subdivision (a)(1) of this section
   
   is to permit the debtor some flexibility in determining which of his assets should be sheltered from creditors' claims.

       property allocated to the debtor as a residence is free from the enforcement of creditors' claims only so long as the debtor or dependent for the debtor uses the property as a residence. Once the debtor ceases to so use the exempt property as a residence, the prohibition on the creditor's enforcement of his judgment ceases. In re Love, 42 Bankr. 317 (Bankr.

       </span>
       522(d), and an overhaul of many of North Carolina's exemptions. The concept of the conditional residential exemption is entirely consistent with a long line of North Carolina cases holding that the homestead exemption in North Carolina is conditioned on continued use as a residence and continued ownership. In re Love, 42 Bankr. 317 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1984), aff'd, 54 Bankr. 947 (E.D.N.C. 1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina law clearly provides for a residential exemption which is conditioned upon continued use as a residence and continued ownership. If the exempt residence ceases to be used as a residence or ceases to be owned by the debtor (or a dependent) the property is no longer exempt. In that event, a judgment creditor can enforce the judgment lien. If the judgment lien is unconditionally cancelled the judgment creditor would lose the right to pursue the property in the future should the use or ownership of the property change.

In addition, she was entitled to an exemption in her motor vehicle under G.S. 1C-1601(a)(3) and to an exemption in the amount of $400 for her earnings from the past 60 days under G.S. 1-362.

       Retirement Account Exemption Does Not Apply to Shield a Debtor's Claim to Someone Else's Retirement Account
   
   - Former husband was allowed pursuant to G.S. 1-362 to satisfy a tort judgment against his former wife by executing on her future interest in an equitable distribution award of his 401(k) retirement accounts, as the exemption for individual retirement plans in G.S 1C-1601(a)(9) did not shield from execution the wife's mere expectancy in an equitable distribution claim against the husband's retirement accounts.

       Individual Retirement Account.
   
   - Trial court erred in requiring a judgment debtor to place any funds withdrawn in the future from his Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA) into escrow or trust pending a determination as to whether those funds retained their exempt status because G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9) exempted the debtor's IRAs and the debtor's legal use of funds contained within those IRAs from the creditor's judgment; not only were the IRAs themselves exempt, but the debtor's legal use of the IRAs, in the same manner as if there were no judgment against him, was also exempt.

       Court of appeals did not err in affirming trial court's order vacating plaintiff's writ of execution because the trial court properly applied G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9) in declaring the corpus of defendant's IRAs to be exempt from execution; trial court properly determined that the corpus of each of defendant's IRAs continued to maintain its exempt status.

       Court of appeals erred in vacating trial court's order requiring defendant to place funds withdrawn from his IRAs in an escrow or other trust account for a determination of the funds' exempt status because the trial court acted correctly in fashioning an equitable mechanism to determine the exempt status of future withdrawals from defendant's IRAs, and both parties consented to the escrow arrangement the trial court ordered; given the text of G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9), which focuses its protection on "retirement plans," there may be some circumstances under which withdrawn funds are no longer exempt from execution.

       - Given the close similarity between the tax treatment of tax-sheltered annuities and individual retirement plans and the common purpose of both types of plans, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, Greensboro Division, is convinced that the Supreme Court of North Carolina Court would conclude that 26 U.S.C.S.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       403(b) tax-sheltered annuities are "treated in the same manner as" individual retirement plans and therefore would construe G.S. 1C-1601(a)(9) as encompassing such tax-sheltered annuities as property that may be exempted under that statute. Accordingly, the debtor was allowed to claim an exemption in this type of retirement plan. In re Garner, - Bankr. - (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Apr. 29, 2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability to Alimony.
   
   - Since G.S. 1C-1601(e)(9) did not apply to claims for alimony, the trial court properly denied the ex-husband's motion to exempt his retirement account. Rhew v. Felton, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 631 S.E.2d 859, appeal dismissed, review denied, 636 S.E.2d 810 (2006).

       <b>
        Purpose of Subsection (d).
       </b>
       - The obvious purpose of subsection (d) of this section is to prevent pre-petition planning whereby a debtor uses nonexempt property to purchase exempt personal property, or purchases exempt personal property with the proceeds of a dischargeable loan obligation. In re Ellis, 33 Bankr. 16 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1983).

       <b>
        Applicability of Subsection (e) to Court Appointed Counsel Fees.
       </b>
       - The State assumes the status of a judgment lien creditor against the assets of an indigent defendant who has accepted court-appointed counsel and been found guilty of the offense. The lien is not valid unless the indigent defendant was given both notice of the state claim and the opportunity to resist its perfection in a hearing before the trial court. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina is not barred from structuring a program to collect the amount it is owed from a financially-able defendant through reasonable and fairly administered procedures. The State's initiatives in this area naturally must be narrowly drawn to avoid either chilling the indigent's exercise of the right to counsel, or creating discriminating terms of repayment based solely on the defendant's poverty. Beyond these threshold requirements, however, the State has wide latitude to shape its attorneys' fees recoupment or restitution program along the lines it deems most appropriate for achieving lawful state objectives. Alexander v. Johnson, 742 F.2d 117 (4th Cir. 1984).

      <p>
       Compensation for Personal Injury Includes Attorney Fees.
   
   - Law in the Fourth Circuit was quite clear that the attorney fees paid to a debtor's personal injury attorneys as part of the settlement of her personal injury case were exempt under G.S. 1C-1601(a)(8); therefore, there was no legal basis for the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a></cite> trustee's motion to determine that they were part of the debtor's bankruptcy estate.

       <b>
        Mere Stress and Inconvenience Do Not Qualify as Personal Injuries.
       </b>
       - Definition of personal injury is not limited to a physical bodily injury under North Carolina law; however, in order to fall under the exemption, the injury leading to the compensation should rise to a level of severe emotional distress. In other words, mere stress and inconvenience, while certainly a basis for sanctions or damages, do not qualify as personal injuries. Brantley v. CitiFinancial, Inc. (In re Brantley), - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Jan. 15, 2015).

      <p>
       <b>
        Term "purchase" does not encompass every means of acquiring property,
       </b>
       and should be defined in the context of subsection (d) of this section so as not to include an acquisition of exemptable personal property where there is no new interest in property obtained, but merely a transfer of equity from the property given to the property received. This definition allows the statute to accomplish its purpose of denying debtors the benefit of certain prebankruptcy petition planning, but will not unnecessarily hinder an honest debtor who trades certain property which could be claimed as exempt for other property of like kind a short time before seeking a fresh start. In re Ellis, 33 Bankr. 16 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1983).

       Trial Court's Findings As to Value of Stock Unsupported by Evidence.
   
   - In a G.S. 1C-1603(e) proceeding on an objection to a debtor's claimed exemption, a trial court failed to make sufficient findings as to how or by what methodology it concluded that the value of the debtor's stock in a development company was zero; there was no evidence supporting the trial court's finding that, purely as a result of pending litigation, the company had no value, and no authority permitted the trial court to base its allowance of a party's claim of exemption on the court's assessment of the equities between the parties rather than on the actual value of the property.

       The legislature exercised its right to "opt out" of the federal bankruptcy exemptions law by adopting a statute which provides North Carolina citizens with a list of exemptions available to them, and precludes a debtor's use of the federal "laundry list" by expressly not authorizing its use. Thus the exemptions available to a North Carolina debtor in bankruptcy are those prescribed by G.S. 1C-1601, 1C-1602 and the exemptions, other than those in 11 U.S.C.

       Finding of Nonresidency Upheld.
   
   - Where the only evidence supporting defendant's contention of residency was her statement that she "hoped" to return to this State as soon as her sister's estate in Ireland was settled, this general declaration did not of itself defeat the trial court's findings of nonresidency in light of the other facts of the case, especially the undisputed evidence that defendant had moved to Ireland (her place of citizenship) at least one year previously, had no dwelling in this State, and offered no definite plan to return.

       Interest of Creditor in Goods of Debtor Who Failed to Elect Exemption.
   
   - When debtor failed to make an election for an exemption under this section, allowing debtor to retain $2,500 (now $3,500) worth of household goods and furnishings free from judgment, there was no unfair or deceptive practice on the part of a creditor who took a nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interest in debtor's household goods and furnishings, even if creditor failed to inform debtor that such an exemption was available.

       <b>
        Effect of Federal Claims on Exemptions.
       </b>
       - North Carolina's exemptions in this Article "are inapplicable" to federal claims only insofar as federal law or regulations provide that they are inapplicable. In other words, there must be a provision of federal law or regulation which specifically creates an exception to the general exemption provisions; otherwise, the property is exempt from federal claims. See opinion of Attorney General to Ms. Sarah S. Kaylor, Special Investigator, Department of Social Services, Catawba County, 55 N.C.A.G. 13 (1985).

      <p>
       The exemptions of this Article are applicable to civil claims arising from the Aid for Families with Dependent Children, Medicaid, and food stamp programs asserted by county departments of social services acting as the administering agencies for such programs. The exemptions are inapplicable to Child Support and Establishment of Paternity (Title IV, Part D of the Social Security Act) programs insofar as they are claims for child support under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50</a></cite>.

       § 1C-1602. Alternative exemptions.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The debtor may elect to take the personal property and homestead exemptions provided in Article X of the Constitution of North Carolina instead of the exemptions provided by G.S. 1C-1601. If the debtor elects to take his constitutional exemptions, the exemptions provided in G.S. 1C-1601 shall not apply and in that event the exemptions provided in this Article shall not be construed so as to affect the personal property and homestead exemptions granted by Article X of the Constitution of North Carolina. If the debtor elects to take his constitutional exemptions, the clerk or district court judge must designate the property to be exempt under the procedure set out in G.S. 1C-1603. The debtor is entitled to have one thousand dollars ($1,000) in value in real property owned and occupied by him and five hundred dollars ($500.00) in value in his personal property exempted from sale under execution. If the value of the property in which the debtor claims his constitutional exemption is in excess of his exemptions, the clerk, in an execution, may order the sale of the property with the proceeds of the sale being distributed first to the debtor to satisfy his exemption and the excess to be distributed as ordered.

        Exemptions Available in Bankruptcy.
       </b>
       - The legislature exercised its right to "opt out" of the federal bankruptcy exemptions law by adopting a statute which provides North Carolina citizens with a list of exemptions available to them, and precludes a debtor's use of the federal "laundry list" by expressly not authorizing its use. Thus the exemptions available to a North Carolina debtor in bankruptcy are those prescribed by G.S. 1C-1601, 1C-1602 and the exemptions, other than those in 11 U.S.C.

The clerk of the county where the land is located must enter a notation of the designation of exempt property on the judgment docket. If a judgment is docketed in a county where real property is located after that real property has been designated as exempt, the transcript of judgment must indicate that the exemptions have been designated.

        Failure to Comply with Procedural Requirements.

       - Debtors may not claim exemption rights in bankruptcy which they would not be entitled to under state law due to their failure to comply with state law procedural requirements, such as by failing to respond to the notice of right to have exemptions designated.

      <p>
       Court clerk's error in not filing an order to set aside exempt property before issuing a writ of execution against a bankruptcy debtor's property as required by G.S. 1C-1603(e)(6) did not invalidate the execution sale, since the error did not have a material effect on the sale of the property or prejudice the debtor or creditors with a judgment lien against the property; the debtor was aware at all times of the steps being taken to execute against the property, the property was not included in the debtor's claim of exempt property, the creditors had actual notice of the purchaser's intention to file repeated upset bids to raise the sale price, and the fact that the property was likely sold significantly below market value did not establish materiality of the clerk's error.

        Exemptions Available in Bankruptcy.
       </b>
       - The legislature exercised its right to "opt out" of the federal bankruptcy exemptions law by adopting a statute which provides North Carolina citizens with a list of exemptions available to them, and precludes a debtor's use of the federal "laundry list" by expressly not authorizing its use. Thus the exemptions available to a North Carolina debtor in bankruptcy are those prescribed by G.S. 1C-1601, G.S. 1C-1602 and the exemptions, other than those in 11 U.S.C.

       </b>
       - G.S. 1C-1601(c) and G.S. 1C-1603(e) severely undermine the effectiveness and limit the application of the federal bankruptcy provisions. The federal provision, 11 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       522(l), must be read independent of the state provision in order to resolve the inherent conflict between the two. There is no question that when a state law conflicts with a federal law, the former is preempted by the latter. The inconsistencies which exist between federal and state law should undoubtedly be resolved in favor of federal law. Thus, where a time limitation or a lack of time limitation in a federal provision is different from a provision in state legislation, the federal legislation controls. To hold otherwise, especially in the context of bankruptcy, would frustrate Congress' policy of giving debtors a new start. North Carolina Baptist Hosps. v. Howell, 51 Bankr. 1015 (M.D.N.C. 1985).

       Interest of Creditor in Goods of Debtor Who Failed to Elect Exemption.
   
   - When debtor failed to make an election for an exemption under G.S. 1C-1601, allowing debtor to retain $2,500 (now $3,500) worth of household goods and furnishings free from judgment, there was no unfair or deceptive practice on the part of a creditor who took a nonpossessory, nonpurchase money security interest in debtor's household goods and furnishings, even if creditor failed to inform debtor that such an exemption was available. See Ken-Mar Fin. v. Harvey, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 368 S.E.2d 646, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 365</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 542 (1988).

   - Where the debtor requested that the allotment of his homestead begin at a point at the front door of his dwelling, with the result that the entire area allotted was located in the hallway adjacent to the front door of the house, the fact that the allotment was useless to the debtor and impaired the value of the remaining property available for satisfaction of the creditor's judgment did not entitle the debtor to claim his exemption in the entire dwelling.

       Property allocated to the debtor as exempt is free of the enforcement of the claims of creditors for indebtedness incurred before or after the exempt property is set aside, other than claims exempted by G.S. 1C-1601(e), for so long as the debtor owns it. When the property is conveyed to another, the exemption ceases as to liens attaching prior to the conveyance. Creation of a security interest in the property does not constitute a conveyance within the meaning of this section, but a transfer in satisfaction of, or for the enforcement of, a security interest is a conveyance. When exempt property is conveyed, the debtor may have other exemptions allotted.

       Construction.
   
   - Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgment Act, G.S. 1C-1701, is not on a parity with the Full Faith and Credit Clause. DocRx, Inc. v. EMI Servs. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 371</cite>, 758 S.E.2d 390 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Applicability
   
   - Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, G.S. 1C-1701 et seq., did not apply to a North Carolina court giving full faith and credit to a Kentucky judgment, as action on the judgment was not being sought in North Carolina, but the judgment was being relied on as a bar to an insured's claim against an insurer. Freeman v. Pac. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 577 S.E.2d 184 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in granting a seller's motion for relief against a foreign judgment because the judgment was valid and enforceable in North Carolina since a Nebraska trial court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over the seller; because the seller contracted with the buyer, a Nebraska resident, to sell a car and have the car shipped to the buyer's residence in Nebraska, the seller should not have been surprised to be haled into a Nebraska court, and the seller's constitutional right to due process was not violated. Meyer v. Race City Classics, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite> 111, 761 S.E.2d 196 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Authenticated Foreign Judgment.
   
   - In an action to enforce a foreign judgment under this Article of the General Statutes, in the absence of any evidence from the judgment debtor, the introduction of a properly authenticated foreign judgment is entitled the foreign judgment to full faith and credit. Lust v. Fountain of Life, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 429 S.E.2d 435 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of Validity.
   
   - Once a judgment creditor was entitled to a presumption that an out of state judgment was entitled to full faith and credit, the plaintiff was not required, as the defendants suggested, to bring forth evidence that none of the defenses available to defendants were valid; rather the defendants were required to bring forth evidence to rebut the presumption of validity, and, as the defendants offered no such evidence, the trial court correctly ordered that the plaintiff's motion to enforce the judgment be allowed and ordered that the out of state judgment be given full faith and credit. Lust v. Fountain of Life, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 429 S.E.2d 435 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Full Faith And Credit Dependent on Personal Jurisdiction.
   
   - An Alabama default judgment was not entitled to full faith and credit because the Alabama court which entered it lacked personal jurisdiction; the plaintiffs had failed to argue in the North Carolina trial court that the service by mail was adequate, and personal service on defendants's attorney was inadequate because it was not in writing and signed by the defendant and a credible witness. Moss v. Improved Benevolent &amp; Practice Order of Elks of the World, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 172, 532 S.E.2d 825 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Grounds for Attacking Foreign Judgment.
   
   - North Carolina court erred by denying plaintiff's motion to enforce an Alabama judgment pursuant to the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, G.S. 1C-1701 to 1C-1708, on the grounds of intrinsic fraud, misrepresentation and misconduct, because these grounds were not sufficient under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution to deny enforcement of a foreign judgment; in North Carolina, the remedies available under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 60(b) are limited by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution when a foreign judgment is at issue. Postjudgment relief from foreign judgments under Rule 60(b) is limited to the following grounds: (1) the judgment is based upon extrinsic fraud; (2) the judgment is void; or (3) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application. DOCRX, Inc. v. EMI Servs. of NC, LLC, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 7, 738 S.E.2d 199 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to give a judgment from the Virgin Islands Superior Court's small claims division full faith and credit because the judgment violated a litigant's due process rights, as the litigant had no meaningful opportunity to be heard, since the litigant was not allowed to be represented by counsel during the critical fact-finding portion of the proceeding, as the litigant was not allowed to either (1) opt out of the small claims court entirely by removing the case to a trial court that permitted representation by counsel or (2) appeal from a small claims court judgment for a trial de novo in a court that allowed representation by counsel, as the only appeal allowed did not permit taking or considering additional evidence. Tropic Leisure Corp. v. Hailey, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 915, 796 S.E.2d 129 (2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 505, 2017 U.S. LEXIS 7305, 199 L. Ed. 2d 385 (U.S. 2017).

       North Carolina Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act Was Satisfied.
   
   - Law firm complied with the North Carolina Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act, G.S. 1C-1701 et seq., in seeking to enforce a Canadian judgment as: (1) a client resided in the county where the action was filed; (2) an authenticated foreign judgment was properly filed; (3) an affidavit was filed stating that the judgment was final and unsatisfied, the amount owed, and that notice was served; and (4) the firm was not required to prove that none of the client's defenses were valid. Maxwell Schuman &amp; Co. v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 663 S.E.2d 329 (2008), review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 128</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 358 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 128</cite>, 673 S.E.2d 358

       Defenses Preserved Under Act.
   
   - Defenses preserved under North Carolina's Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act are limited by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States to those defenses directed to the validity and enforcement of a foreign judgment.

       "Foreign Judgment."
   
   - Although the Israeli order in the husband and wife's divorce case was not a "foreign judgment" under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA) because the order was not the order of a United States court or a state court, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the wife and in recognizing that the husband owed a certain sum to the wife under the Israeli order; the wife made it clear in the wife's complaint that the wife was proceeding under the North Carolina Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (NCFMJRA), which included in its definition of foreign state any governmental unit other than the United States, and thus the trial court could recognize the wife's rights under the NCFMJRA that would allow the wife to later pursue enforcement of the Israeli order under the UEFJA.

       A copy of any foreign judgment authenticated in accordance with an act of Congress or the statutes of this State may be filed in the office of the clerk of superior court of any county of this State in which the judgment debtor resides, or owns real or personal property. Along with the foreign judgment, the judgment creditor or his attorney shall make and file with the clerk an affidavit which states that the foreign judgment is final and that it is unsatisfied in whole or in part, and which sets forth the amount remaining unpaid on the judgment.

       Upon the filing of the foreign judgment and the affidavit, the foreign judgment shall be docketed and indexed in the same manner as a judgment of this State; however, no execution shall issue upon the foreign judgment nor shall any other proceeding be taken for its enforcement until the expiration of 30 days from the date upon which notice of filing is served in accordance with G.S. 1C-1704.

       This Act's 30 day limitation is a "waiting period" - a restriction on when plaintiff creditors may act and not on when defendant debtors may not;
   
   the 30 day limitation period is not one barring a defendant debtor's response but instead the limitation period is specifically set to bar a plaintiff creditor from obtaining a foreign judgment against one of our state's citizens and then immediately (within 30 days) being able to enforce it without that defendant debtor being afforded the notice required by due process.

       Enforcement of Foreign Judgments.
   
   - Foreign judgment that the judgment creditor obtained in New York was entitled to a presumption that the judgment was entitled to full faith and credit, as the judgment creditor met its burden of showing that entitlement by filing a properly authenticated judgment; however, the general contractor timely moved for relief from the foreign judgment by raising the defense that the New York trial court that entered it did not have personal jurisdiction over the general contractor, and because the trial court did not make any findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the motion to enforce the judgment, the conclusion that the foreign judgment was enforceable in North Carolina was not supported by competent evidence and the case had to be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

       North Carolina court erred by denying plaintiff's motion to enforce an Alabama judgment on the grounds of intrinsic fraud, misrepresentation and misconduct, because these grounds were not sufficient under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution to deny enforcement of a foreign judgment; the trial court erred by determining that G.S. 1C-1703(c) entitled defendant to raise against enforcement of the Alabama judgment the same defenses as a judgment of North Carolina, because the remedies available under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C.

       Enforcement of Foreign Judgments.
   
   - Although the Israeli order in the husband and wife's divorce case was not a "foreign judgment" under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA) because the order was not the order of a United States court or a state court, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the wife and in recognizing that the husband owed a certain sum to the wife under the Israeli order; the wife made it clear in the wife's complaint that the wife was proceeding under the North Carolina Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (NCFMJRA), which included in its definition of foreign state any governmental unit other than the United States, and thus the trial court could recognize the wife's rights under the NCFMJRA that would allow the wife to later pursue enforcement of the Israeli order under the UEFJA.

       This Act's 30 day limitation is a "waiting period" - a restriction on when plaintiff creditors may act and not on when defendant debtors may not;
   
   the 30 day limitation period is not one barring a defendant debtor's response but instead the limitation period is specifically set to bar a plaintiff creditor from obtaining a foreign judgment against one of our state's citizens and then immediately (within 30 days) being able to enforce it without that defendant debtor being afforded the notice required by due process.

       Grounds for Attacking Foreign Judgment.
   
   - A judgment of another state may be attacked in this state only on grounds of fraud, public policy, or lack of jurisdiction. Reinwand v. Swiggett, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 421 S.E.2d 367 (1992).
      </p>
      <p>
       Once a creditor establishes, under G.S. 1C-1705(b), that a foreign judgment is entitled to full faith and credit, the judgment may only be attacked on the grounds of fraud, public policy, or lack of jurisdiction; no authority permitted a district court to base its allowance of a party's claim of exemption on the court's assessment of the equities between the parties rather than on the actual value of the property. Susi v. Aubin, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 620 S.E.2d 682 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       North Carolina court erred by denying plaintiff's motion to enforce an Alabama judgment under G.S. 1C-1705(a) on the grounds of intrinsic fraud, misrepresentation and misconduct, because these grounds were not sufficient under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution to deny enforcement of a foreign judgment; in North Carolina, the remedies available under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 60(b) are limited by the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution when a foreign judgment is at issue. Postjudgment relief from foreign judgments under Rule 60(b) is limited to the following grounds: (1) the judgment is based upon extrinsic fraud; (2) the judgment is void; or (3) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.

       Illinois judgment was enforceable in North Carolina, because plaintiff met its burden of proving that the foreign judgment was entitled to full faith and credit by attaching an authenticated copy of the Illinois judgment to its notice of filing foreign judgment and defendant failed to rebut that presumption.

      <p>
       It was error to give a judgment from the Virgin Islands Superior Court's small claims division full faith and credit because the judgment violated a litigant's due process rights, as the litigant had no meaningful opportunity to be heard, since the litigant was not allowed to be represented by counsel during the critical fact-finding portion of the proceeding, as the litigant was not allowed to either (1) opt out of the small claims court entirely by removing the case to a trial court that permitted representation by counsel or (2) appeal from a small claims court judgment for a trial de novo in a court that allowed representation by counsel, as the only appeal allowed did not permit taking or considering additional evidence.

       Foreign judgment that the judgment creditor obtained in New York was entitled to a presumption that the judgment was entitled to full faith and credit, as the judgment creditor met its burden of showing that entitlement by filing a properly authenticated judgment; however, the general contractor timely moved for relief from the foreign judgment by raising the defense that the New York trial court that entered it did not have personal jurisdiction over the general contractor, and because the trial court did not make any findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the motion to enforce the judgment, the conclusion that the foreign judgment was enforceable in North Carolina was not supported by competent evidence and the case had to be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings. Quantum Corp. Funding, Ltd. v. B.H. Bryan Bldg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 483, 623 S.E.2d 793 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court properly determined that a New York judgment was not enforceable against a debtor because of a lack of personal jurisdiction over the debtor, and a creditor failed to challenge this conclusion of law. Hence, the superior court properly determined that the debtor rebutted the presumption that the North Carolina Courts should grant full faith and credit to the New York judgment. Orix Fin. Servs. v.

       Where Jurisdiction Fully and Fairly Litigated.

       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol11">
        "Action." A suit or arbitration may be legal or equitable in nature, but it must be based on a pecuniary claim.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol12">
        "Bank-offered spot rate" is the rate at which a bank will sell the requisite amount of foreign money for immediate or nearly immediate use by the buyer.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol13">
        "Conversion date." Exchange rates may fluctuate from day to day. A date must be picked for calculating the value of foreign money in terms of United States dollars. As used in the Act, "conversion date" means the day before a foreign-money claim is paid or set-off. The day refers to the time period of the place of the payor, not necessarily that of the recipient. The exchange rate prevailing at or near the close of business on the banking day before the day payment is made will be well known at the time of payment. See Comment 2 to Section 7.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol14">
        "Distribution proceeding." In keeping with the concept underlying Section 2, the coverage of this statute is limited to judicial actions and nonjudicial proceedings which involve the creation of a fund from which pro-rata distributions are made to claimants. As provided in Section 8, a different conversion date is required where either input to or outgo from a fund involves two or more different moneys. Thus, the term includes a mortgage foreclosure proceeding, judicial or under a trust deed, distribution of property in divorce and child support proceedings, distributions in the administration of a trust or a decedent's estate, an assignment for the benefit of creditors, an equity receivership, a liquidation by a statutory successor, a voluntary dissolution of a business or a nonprofit enterprise or the like when in each case a fund must be shared among claimants and where, usually, the fund will not satisfy all claimants of the same class. An asset or a liability of the fund must also involve one or more foreign-money claims, but not all of the claims can be in the same money.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol15">
        "Foreign money." Since only the federal government has the power to coin money and regulate the value thereof, the term "foreign" means a government other than that of the United States of America. Special Drawing Rights of the International Monetary Fund are foreign money even though the United States is a member of the Fund. Foreign governments included are all those whose moneys are, in the currency markets of the world, exchangeable for the money of other currencies even though the government is not recognized by the United States.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol16">
        "Foreign-money claim." The term "claim" is not limited to any one party to an action or a distribution proceeding and may be asserted by a plaintiff or a defendant or by a party to an arbitration or distribution proceeding. It may be based on a foreign judgment, or sound in contract, quasi-contract, or tort.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol17">
        "Money." The definition includes composite currencies such as European Currency Units created by agreement of the governments that are members of the European Monetary System or the Special Drawing Rights created under the auspices of the International Money Fund. These are "stores of value" used to determine the quantity of payment in some international transactions.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol18">
        "Money of the claim." See Section 4 and the Comment thereto.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol19">
        "Party." This combines the Uniform Commercial Code's definitions of "person" and "organization," but is limited to those who are parties to transactions or involved in events which could give rise to a foreign-money claim.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol110">
        "Rate of Exchange." A free market rate is to be used rather than an official rate if both exist. Some countries have transactional differences in exchange rates with slightly different rates; for example, in Belgium one rate prevails for commercial and another for financial transactions. Both rates are recognized in money market transactions. The last sentence of the definition indicates that the rate appropriate to the transaction is the rate to be used.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol111">
        "Spot rate" is the term used in the financial markets of the United States for the rate of exchange for immediate or nearly immediate transfers from one money to another, as distinguished from the rates for future options or future deliveries.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1820-officialcommentol112">
        "State." The definition, as in other Uniform Laws, is extended to include areas given the same, or nearly the same, treatment in law as the states.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       In the foreign exchange markets, as in the stock markets, quotations are either "bid" or "ask," and the spread between is where the dealer makes a profit. An "offered spot rate" is the rate at which the offeror will sell the particular money. It is, of course, higher than the rate at which that person will buy the same money. "Spot" refers to the time the trade is made, not the time for settlement, which in spot transactions is often two days after the date of the trade.

        A basic policy of the Act is to preserve freedom of contract and to permit parties to resolve disputed matters by contract at any time, even as to choice of law problems. The parties may agree upon the date and time for conversion. After entry of judgment the parties may agree upon how the judgment is to be satisfied.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1822-officialcommentol12">
        Subsection (b) covers cases where, for example, claims for petroleum may be settled in United States dollars but settlement for joint costs of exploration may be in pounds sterling. The parties also may agree on the money to be used for damages. The second sentence recognizes that a price stated in a particular money does not indicate, without more evidence, an intent that all damages from breach are to be in the same money. The principle of freedom of contract allows the parties to allocate the risks of currency fluctuations between foreign moneys as they desire. Sections 4 and 5 provide rules in the absence of special agreements by the parties for determining the money to be used. Parties may by agreement select a particular market or foreign exchange dealer to be used for exchange purposes.

        Subsection (a) uses "payment" in a broad sense not related to just the price, but to any obligation arising out of a contract to transfer money. See also Section 3(b).
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1823-officialcommentol12">
        Subsection (b) states rules to fill gaps in the agreement of the parties with rules as to the allocation of risks of fluctuations in exchange rates. The three rules will normally apply in the order stated. Prior dealings may indicate the desired money. If there are none, it is appropriate to use the money indicated by trade usage or custom for transactions of like kind. The final rule of subsection (a) is one established in English cases. See The Despina R and the Folias (1979) A.C. 685. An example is the use of an operating account in United States dollars by a French company to buy Japanese yen for ship repairs; the loss is felt in the depletion of the dollar bank account. Appropriateness of a rule is to be determined by the judge from the facts of the case. See Section 6(d).

       A monetary claim is neither usurious nor unconscionable for the reason that the agreement on which it is based provides that the amount of the debtor's obligation to be paid in the debtor's money, when received by the creditor, must equal a specified amount of the foreign money of the country of the creditor. If, because of unexcused delay in payment of a judgment or award, the amount received by the creditor does not equal the amount of the foreign money specified in the agreement, the court or arbitrator shall amend the judgment or award accordingly.

        Subsections (a) and (b) cover different interpretation problems. One arises where the amount of the money to be paid is measured by another money, one of which is foreign. An example is "pay 5,000 Swiss francs in pounds sterling." The issue is the time at which the rate of exchange into pounds sterling is to be applied. Subsection (a) says in a "measured by" situation with no rate specified, the rate of exchange that controls is the one prevailing at or near the close of business on the day before the day of payment. See Section 1(2), the definition of "conversion date."
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1824-officialcommentol12">
        Another problem arises when an exchange rate in effect before a default is used, as in "pay on November 30, 1989, 5,000 Swiss francs in pounds sterling at the exchange rate prevailing on June 30, 1989." In this case, the issue is how long does the specified exchange rate control in the absence of a clear expression of intent?
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1824-officialcommentol13">
        The most common application of subsection (c) will be found in international loan transactions. For example, a loan by a Japanese bank to an American company could be made with dollars purchased by yen for the purpose. The loan agreement could provide for repayment in dollars of an amount which, when received by the lender, would repurchase the amount of yen used to acquire the dollars advanced.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Inclusion of a fixed rate as of a date before default, under subsection (b), remains effective only if payment is made within a reasonable time after default, not to exceed 30 days. The 30-day limitation accords usually with the expectation of the parties. Parties may agree to a longer time.
      </p>
      <p>
       An exemption is needed from the application of usury laws that may be interpreted to hold that the indexing of the principal amount creates additional interest. See
       <i>

       </i>
       , 530 S.W.2d 756 (Tenn. Sup. Ct. 1975). The subsection removes all doubts as to the legal enforceability of such agreements under theories such as usury, merger in a judgment, unconscionability, or the like.

        Subsection (a) covers not only the claim of a plaintiff but also the assertion by a defendant of a defense, set-off, or counterclaim. Subsection (b) provides that the money asserted as the money of its defenses by the defendant need not be the same as that of the plaintiff.

        The money to be used as the money of the claim is a threshold issue to be determined, if contested, by the court after any factual issues as to expenditures, custom, usage, or course of dealing are decided. See subsection (b). If a payment is made or a debt incurred in a money other than that in which the loss was felt, the party asserting the foreign-money claim should establish the amount of the money of the claim used to procure the money of expenditure and the applicable exchange rate used.

        Judgments may be entered in more than one money when dealings impact on more than one area.

        Subsection (a) changes a number of statutes in the states which can be construed to require all values in legal proceedings to be expressed in United States dollars. Professor Brand, in his article in the Yale Journal of International Law, Vol. 11:139 at page 169, identified 18 states having statutes which could require all judgments to be entered in dollars. They are Arkansas, California, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, South Carolina, Tennessee, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Brand, ibid. fn. 166. Hence, direct statutory authority must be given the courts in those states, and will be helpful in other states. In some states other statutes may need amendments. See, e.g., Wisc. Stats. §§ 138.01, 138.02, 138.03, and 779.05.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1826-officialcommentol12">
        Subsection (d) gives defendants the option of paying in dollars which are, at the payment date, practically the economic equivalent of the foreign money awarded. The judgment creditor should be indifferent to whether the debtor exercises the right to pay in dollars as the only difference is a small bank charge for exchanging the dollars for the foreign money. The concept of the rate of the banking day next before the payment day is taken from Section 131 of the Province of Ontario, Canada, Courts of Justice Act (Ch. 11 Ont. Stats. (1984) as recently amended). It gives the defendant and the sheriff conducting the sale the necessary conversion rate comfortably ahead of its use. Newspaper quotations are usually said to be 'at or near the close of business' on the stated date, so that phrase is used in this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1826-officialcommentol13">
        Subsection (e) provides for netting the affirmative recoveries of a defendant and plaintiff, whether in the same money or in different moneys, but preserving the quantum of each for appellate purposes. The theory is that when claims are reduced to money, they become mutual debts and should be set-off, so that a person's exchange rate fluctuation risk continues only for the surplus in its money of the claim. The set-off is made by the judge or arbitrator.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1826-officialcommentol14">
        The form of judgment in subsection (f) should be varied appropriately where the money to be paid is measured by a foreign money. See Section 5.

        As to pre-judgment interest, the Act adopts the majority rule in the United States that pre-judgment interest follows the substantive law of the case under conflict of laws rules, both as to the right to recover and the rate. English courts use a different rule, i.e., the borrowing rate used by plaintiff or prevailing in the country issuing the money of the judgment. See Helmsing Schiffarts G.M.B.H. v. Malta Drydock Corp. (1977) 2 Lloyd's Rep. 44 (Maltese money but borrowed in West Germany; German rate); Miliangos v. George Frank (Textiles) Ltd. (No. 2) (1976) 1 QB 487 at 489 (Swiss money, Swiss interest rate). Although pre-judgment interest is one form of damages, provision for pre- judgment interest is not to be taken as indicating that no other damages for delay in payment can be awarded under the substantive law applicable to the determination of damages. Cf. Isaac Naylor & Sons, Ltd. v. New Zealand Co-operative Wool Marketing Association, Ltd. (1981) 1 N.Z.L.R. 361 (exchange loss due to delay as additional damages).
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1828-officialcommentol12">
        Allowances of pre-judgment interest in some states depend upon a party's conduct with respect to settlement or delay of the proceeding. Subsection (b) treats these state laws as either procedural in nature or expressions of a significant policy, in either case to be governed by the law of the forum state.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca19s1C-1828-officialcommentol13">
        Interest on a judgment is considered to be procedural and also goes by the law of the forum. There is a problem here in that there is great discrepancy among the states in the rates for judgment interest. When a judgment is in a foreign money, United States interest rates may result in some overcompensation or undercompensation as compared to what would be awarded in the jurisdiction issuing the foreign money. But in both the United States and in foreign countries, most jurisdictions have fixed statutory rates that do not readily respond to the inflation or deflation of the value of their money in the world market. Hence it was decided to apply the usual rules of the conflict of laws.

       This section protects those who must determine how much should be held subject to a levy or other collection process or what the dollar amount of a supersedeas or other surety bond should be. If the judgment debtor is damaged by a gross overstatement of the dollar amount in the affidavit or certificate of counsel for the judgment creditor or the bank officer, recovery should be against that person.

        Subsection (a) refers to situations in which a country authorizes the issue of a new money to take the place of the old money at a stated ratio. An example is Brazil's recent abolition of cruzieros for cruzados. The subsection mandates that foreign money claims should be subjected to the same ratio.

        The Act takes no position on the effect of money repudiations or revalorizations so drastic as to be, in effect, confiscations. Remedy, if any, for these is usually found through diplomatic channels. Equally, the Act takes no position on the effect of exchange control laws. The effect, if any, on obligations to pay is left to other law.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Source: This section is derived from Section 1 of the Uniform Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act of 1962.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1851-officialcommentol11">
        The defined terms "foreign state" and "foreign judgment" in the 1962 Act have been changed to "foreign country" and "foreign-country judgment" in order to make it clear that the Act does not apply to recognition of sister-state judgments. Some courts have noted that the "foreign state" and "foreign judgment" definitions of the 1962 Act have caused confusion as to whether the Act should apply to sister-state judgments because "foreign state" and "foreign judgment" are terms of art generally used in connection with recognition and enforcement of sister-state judgments. See, e.g., Eagle Leasing v. Amandus, 476 N.W.2d 35 (S. Ct. Iowa 1991) (reversing lower court's application of UFMJRA to a sister-state judgment, but noting lower court's confusion was understandable as "foreign judgment" is term of art normally applied to sister-state judgments). See also, Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act §1 (defining "foreign judgment" as the judgment of a sister state or federal court).
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1851-officialcommentol12">
        The definition of "foreign-country judgment" in this Act differs significantly from the 1962 Act's definition of "foreign judgment." The 1962 Act's definition served in large part as a scope provision for the Act. The part of the definition defining the scope of the Act has been moved to section 3, which is the scope section.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1851-officialcommentol13">
        The definition of "foreign-country judgment" in this Act refers to "a judgment" of "a court" of the foreign country. The foreign-country judgment need not take a particular form - any order or decree that meets the requirements of this section and comes within the scope of the Act under Section 3 is subject to the Act. Similarly, any competent government tribunal that issues such a "judgment" comes within the term "court" for purposes of this Act. The judgment, however, must be a judgment of an adjudicative body of the foreign country, and not the result of an alternative dispute mechanism chosen by the parties. Thus, foreign arbitral awards and agreements to arbitrate are not covered by this Act. They are governed instead by federal law, Chapter 2 of the U.S. Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 201-208, implementing the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards and Chapter 3 of the U.S. Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 301-307, implementing the Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration. A judgment of a foreign court confirming or setting aside an arbitral award, however, would be covered by this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1851-officialcommentol14">
        The definition of "foreign-country judgment" does not limit foreign-country judgments to those rendered in litigation between private parties. Judgments in which a governmental entity is a party also are included, and are subject to this Act if they meet the requirements of this section and are within the scope of the Act under Section 3.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The 1962 Act defines a "foreign state" as "any governmental unit other than the United States, or any state, district, commonwealth, territory, insular possession thereof, or the Panama Canal Zone, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, or the Ryuku Islands." Rather than simply updating the list in the 1962 Act's definition of "foreign state," the new definition of "foreign country" in this Act combines the "listing" approach of the 1962 Act's "foreign state" definition with a provision that defines "foreign country" in terms of whether the judgments of the particular government's courts are initially subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause standards for determining whether those judgments will be recognized. Under this new definition, a governmental unit is a "foreign country" if it is (1) not the United States or a state, district, commonwealth, territory or insular possession of the United States; and (2) its judgments are not initially subject to Full Faith and Credit Clause standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Full Faith and Credit Clause, Art. IV, section 1, provides that "Full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records, and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof." Whether the judgments of a governmental unit are subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause may be determined by judicial interpretation of the Full Faith and Credit Clause or by statute, or by a combination of these two sources. For example, pursuant to the authority granted by the second sentence of the Full Faith and Credit Clause, Congress has passed 28 U.S.C.A.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1738, which provides
       <i>
        inter alia
       </i>
       that court records from "any State, Territory, or Possession of the United States" are entitled to full faith and credit under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. In
       <i>
        Stoll v. Gottlieb
       </i>
       , 305 U.S. 165, 170 (1938), the United States Supreme Court held that this statute also requires that full faith and credit be given to judgments of federal courts. States also have made determinations as to whether certain types of judgments are subject to the Full Faith and Credit Clause. E.g. Day v. Montana Dept. Of Social & Rehab. Servs., 900 P.2d 296 (Mont. 1995) (tribal court judgment not subject to Full Faith and Credit, and should be treated with same deference shown foreign-country judgments). Under the definition of "foreign country" in this Act, the determination as to whether a governmental unit's judgments are subject to full faith and credit standards should be made by reference to any relevant law, whether statutory or decisional, that is applicable "in this state."
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of "foreign country" in terms of those judgments not subject to Full Faith and Credit standards also has the advantage of more effectively coordinating the Act with the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. That Act, which establishes a registration procedure for the enforcement of sister state and equivalent judgments, defines a "foreign judgment" as "any judgment, decree, or order of a court of the United States or of any other court which is entitled to full faith and credit in this state." Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       1 (1964). By defining "foreign country" in the Recognition Act in terms of those judgments not subject to full faith and credit standards, this Act makes it clear that the Enforcement Act and the Recognition Act are mutually exclusive - if a foreign money judgment is subject to full faith and credit standards, then the Enforcement Act's registration procedure is available with regard to its enforcement; if the foreign money judgment is not subject to full faith and credit standards, then the foreign money judgment may not be enforced until recognition of it has been obtained in accordance with the provisions of the Recognition Act.

   - Although the Israeli order in the husband and wife's divorce case was not a "foreign judgment" under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA) because the order was not the order of a United States court or a state court, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the wife and in recognizing that the husband owed a certain sum to the wife under the Israeli order; the wife made it clear in the wife's complaint that the wife was proceeding under the North Carolina Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (NCFMJRA), which included in its definition of foreign state any governmental unit other than the United States, and thus the trial court could recognize the wife's rights under the NCFMJRA that would allow the wife to later pursue enforcement of the Israeli order under the UEFJA.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Source: This section is based on Section 2 of the 1962 Act. Subsection (b) contains material that was included as part of the definition of "foreign judgment" in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act. Subsection (c) is new.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1852-officialcommentol11">
        Like the 1962 Act, this Act sets out in subsection 3(a) two basic requirements that a foreign-country judgment must meet before it comes within the scope of this Act - the foreign-country judgment must (1) grant or deny recovery of a sum of money and (2) be final, conclusive and enforceable under the law of the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 3(b) then sets out three types of foreign-country judgments that are excluded from the coverage of this Act, even though they meet the criteria of subsection 3(a) - judgments for taxes, judgments constituting fines and other penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. These exclusions are comparable to those contained in Section 1(2) of the 1962 Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1852-officialcommentol12">
        This Act applies to a foreign-country judgment only to the extent the foreign-country judgment grants or denies recovery of a sum of money. If a foreign-country judgment both grants or denies recovery of a sum money and provides for some other form of relief, this Act would apply to the portion of the judgment that grants or denies monetary relief, but not to the portion that provides for some other form of relief. The U.S. court, however, would be left free to decide to recognize and enforce the non-monetary portion of the judgment under principles of comity or other applicable law. See Section 11.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1852-officialcommentol13">
        In order to come within the scope of this Act, a foreign-country judgment must be final, conclusive, and enforceable under the law of the foreign country in which it was rendered. This requirement contains three distinct, although inter-related concepts. A judgment is final when it is not subject to additional proceedings in the rendering court other than execution. A judgment is conclusive when it is given effect between the parties as a determination of their legal rights and obligations. A judgment is enforceable when the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor complies with the judgment are available to the judgment creditor to assist in collection of the judgment.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1852-officialcommentol14">
        Subsection 3(b) follows the 1962 Act by excluding three categories of foreign-country money judgments from the scope of the Act - judgments for taxes, judgments that constitute fines and penalties, and judgments in domestic relations matters. The domestic relations exclusion has been redrafted to make it clear that all judgments in domestic relations matters are excluded from the Act, not just judgments "for support" as provided in the 1962 Act. This is consistent with interpretation of the 1962 Act by the courts, which extended the "support" exclusion in the 1962 Act beyond its literal wording to exclude other money judgments in connection with domestic matters. E.g., Wolff v. Wolff, 389 A.2d 413 (My. App. 1978) ("support" includes alimony).
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1852-officialcommentol15">
        Under subsection 3(b), a foreign-country money judgment is not within the scope of this Act "to the extent" that it comes within one of the excluded categories. Therefore, if a foreign-country money judgment is only partially within one of the excluded categories, the non-excluded portion will be subject to this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1852-officialcommentol16">
        Subsection 3(c) is new. The 1962 Act does not expressly allocate the burden of proof with regard to establishing whether a foreign-country judgment is within the scope of the Act. Courts applying the 1962 Act generally have held that the burden of proof is on the person seeking recognition to establish that the judgment is final, conclusive and enforceable where rendered. E.g., Mayekawa Mfg. Co. Ltd. v. Sasaki, 888 P.2d 183, 189 (Wash. App. 1995) (burden of proof on creditor to establish judgment is final, conclusive, and enforceable where rendered); Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, 45 F. Supp. 2d 276, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (party seeking recognition must establish that there is a final judgment, conclusive and enforceable where rendered); S.C.Chimexim S.A. v. Velco Enterprises, Ltd., 36 F. Supp. 2d 206, 212 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (Plaintiff has the burden of establishing conclusive effect). Subsection (3)(c) places the burden of proof to establish whether a foreign-country judgment is within the scope of the Act on the party seeking recognition of the foreign-country judgment with regard to both subsection (a) and subsection (b).
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       While the first two of these requirements - finality and conclusiveness - will apply with regard to every foreign-country money judgment, the requirement of enforceability is only relevant when the judgment is one granting recovery of a sum of money. A judgment denying a sum of money obviously is not subject to enforcement procedures, as there is no monetary award to enforce. This Act, however, covers both judgments granting and those denying recovery of a sum of money. Thus, the fact that a foreign-country judgment denying recovery of a sum of money is not enforceable does not mean that such judgments are not within the scope of the Act. Instead, the requirement that the judgment be enforceable should be read to mean that, if the foreign-country judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, it must be enforceable in the foreign country in order to be within the scope of the Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the 1962 Act, subsection 3(b) requires that the determinations as to finality, conclusiveness and enforceability be made using the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered. Unless the foreign-country judgment is final, conclusive, and (to the extent it grants recovery of a sum of money) enforceable in the foreign country where it was rendered, it will not be within the scope of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognition and enforcement of domestic relations judgments traditionally has been treated differently from recognition and enforcement of other judgments. The considerations with regard to those judgments, particularly with regard to jurisdiction and finality, differ from those with regard to other money judgments. Further, national laws with regard to domestic relations vary widely, and recognition and enforcement of such judgments thus is more appropriately handled through comity than through use of this uniform Act. Finally, other statutes, such as the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act and the federal International Child Support Enforcement Act, 42 U.S.C.
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       659a (1996), address various aspects of the recognition and enforcement of domestic relations awards. Under Section 11 of this Act, courts are free to recognize money judgments in domestic relations matters under principles of comity or otherwise, and U.S. courts routinely enforce money judgments in domestic relations matters under comity principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Foreign-country judgments for taxes and judgments that constitute fines or penalties traditionally have not been recognized and enforced in U.S. courts.
       <i>
        See, e.g.
       </i>
       , Restatement Third of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       483 (1986). Both the "revenue rule," under which the courts of one country will not enforce the revenue laws of another country, and the prohibition on enforcement of penal judgments seem to be grounded in the idea that one country does not enforce the public laws of another.
       <i>
        See id.
       </i>
       Reporters' Note 2. The exclusion of tax judgments and judgments constituting fines or penalties from the scope of the Act reflects this tradition. Under Section 11, however, courts remain free to consider whether such judgments should be recognized and enforced under comity or other principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       A judgment for taxes is a judgment in favor of a foreign country or one of its subdivisions based on a claim for an assessment of a tax. Thus, a judgment awarding a plaintiff restitution of the purchase price paid for an item would not be considered in any part a judgment for taxes, even though one element of the recovery was the sales tax paid by the plaintiff at the time of purchase. Such a judgment would not be one designed to enforce the revenue laws of the foreign country, but rather one designed to compensate the plaintiff. Courts generally hold that the test for whether a judgment is a fine or penalty is determined by whether its purpose is remedial in nature, with its benefits accruing to private individuals, or it is penal in nature, punishing an offense against public justice.
       <i>
        E.g.
       </i>
       , Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Hoffman, 665 F.Supp 73 (D. Mass. 1987) (finding that Belgium judgment was not penal even though the proceeding forming the basis of the suit was primarily criminal where Belgium court considered damage petition a civil remedy, the judgment did not constitute punishment for an offense against public justice of Belgium, and benefit of the judgment accrued to private judgment creditor, not Belgium). Thus, a judgment that awards compensation or restitution for the benefit of private individuals should not automatically be considered penal in nature and therefore outside the scope of the Act simply because the action is brought on behalf of the private individuals by a government entity.
       <i>
        Cf.
       </i>
       U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement, art.14.7.2, U.S.-Austl., May 18, 2004 (providing that when government agency obtains a civil monetary judgment for purpose of providing restitution to consumers, investors, or customers who suffered economic harm due to fraud, judgment generally should not be denied recognition and enforcement on ground that it is penal or revenue in nature, or based on other foreign public law).

        NORTH CAROLINA COMMENT
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In subdivision (b)(3), the General Statutes Commission substituted "alimony, support, or maintenance in matrimonial or family matters" for the Uniform Act language "divorce, support, or maintenance, or other judgment rendered in connection with domestic relations."
   The change was due to concern that the Uniform Act's language could prevent recognition of an award based on a claim that was brought as part of a divorce action, for example, a tort action against one spouse for damage to the individual property of the other spouse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) corresponds to Section 11 of the Uniform Act ("Saving Clause") with a
   modification.
   The Commission substituted "to which this Article does not apply" for the Uniform Act language "not within the scope of this act." The Commission also added "saving clause" to this section's catchline.

       Scottish judgment was properly recognized because G.S. 1C-1852(b)(3) did not bar recognition as the judgment was not for alimony, support, or maintenance but was for attorney's fees and costs, even though the judgment was entered in an unsuccessful suit for maintenance.

       Scottish judgment for attorney's fees in an unsuccessful suit for maintenance was properly recognized because the North Carolina General Assembly, in adopting the Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act, replaced the language "divorce, support, or maintenance, or other judgment rendered in connection with domestic relations" with "alimony, support, or maintenance in matrimonial or family matters," when defining the family law exception to the recognition of foreign judgments.

        This Section provides the standards for recognition of a foreign-country money judgment. Section 7 sets out the effect of recognition of a foreign-country money judgment under this Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol12">
        Recognition of a judgment means that the forum court accepts the determination of legal rights and obligations made by the rendering court in the foreign country. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws, Ch. 5, Topic 3, Introductory Note (recognition of foreign judgment occurs to the extent the forum court gives the judgment "the same effect with respect to the parties, the subject matter of the action and the issues involved that it has in the state where it was rendered.") Recognition of a foreign-country judgment must be distinguished from enforcement of that judgment. Enforcement of the foreign-country judgment involves the application of the legal procedures of the state to ensure that the judgment debtor obeys the foreign-country judgment. Recognition of a foreign-country money judgment often is associated with enforcement of the judgment, as the judgment creditor usually seeks recognition of the foreign-country judgment primarily for the purpose of invoking the enforcement procedures of the forum state to assist the judgment creditor's collection of the judgment from the judgment debtor. Because the forum court cannot enforce the foreign-country judgment until it has determined that the judgment will be given effect, recognition is a prerequisite to enforcement of the foreign-country judgment. Recognition, however, also has significance outside the enforcement context because a foreign-country judgment also must be recognized before it can be given preclusive effect under res judicata and collateral estoppel principles. The issue of whether a foreign-country judgment will be recognized is distinct from both the issue of whether the judgment will be enforced, and the issue of the extent to which it will be given preclusive effect.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol13">
        Subsection 4(a) places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize a foreign-country money judgment unless one of the grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) or (c) applies. Subsection (b) states three mandatory grounds for denying recognition to a foreign-country money judgment. If the forum court finds that one of the grounds listed in subsection (b) exists, then it must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment. Subsection (c) states eight nonmandatory grounds for denying recognition. The forum court has discretion to decide whether or not to refuse recognition based on one of these grounds. Subsection (d) places the burden of proof on the party resisting recognition of the foreign-country judgment to establish that one of the grounds for nonrecognition exists.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol14">
        The mandatory grounds for nonrecognition stated in subsection (b) are identical to the mandatory grounds stated in Section 4 of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(1) through (6) are based on subsection 4(b)(1) through (6) of the 1962 Act. The discretionary grounds stated in subsection 4(c)(7) and (8) are new.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol15">
        Under subsection (b)(1), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country money judgment if that judgment was "rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law." The standard for this ground for nonrecognition "has been stated authoritatively by the Supreme Court of the United States in Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S.113, 205 (1895). As indicated in that decision, a mere difference in the procedural system is not a sufficient basis for nonrecognition. A case of serious injustice must be involved." Cmt §4, Uniform Foreign Money-Judgment Recognition Act (1962). The focus of inquiry is not whether the procedure in the rendering country is similar to U.S. procedure, but rather on the basic fairness of the foreign-country procedure. Kam-Tech Systems, Ltd. V. Yardeni, 74 A.2d 644, 649 (N.J. App. 2001) (interpreting the comparable provision in the 1962 Act); accord, Society of Lloyd's v. Ashenden, 233 F.3d 473 (7th Cir. 2000) (procedures need not meet all the intricacies of the complex concept of due process that has emerged from U.S. case law, but rather must be fair in the broader international sense) (interpreting comparable provision in the 1962 Act). Procedural differences, such as absence of jury trial or different evidentiary rules are not sufficient to justify denying recognition under subsection (b)(1), so long as the essential elements of impartial administration and basic procedural fairness have been provided in the foreign proceeding. As the U.S. Supreme Court stated in Hilton:
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol16">
        Under section 4(b)(2), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Section 5(a) lists six bases for personal jurisdiction that are adequate as a matter of law to establish that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction. Section 5(b) makes clear that other grounds for personal jurisdiction may be found sufficient.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol17">
        Subsection 4(c)(2) limits the type of fraud that will serve as a ground for denying recognition to extrinsic fraud. This provision is consistent with the interpretation of the comparable provision in subsection 4(b)(2) of the 1962 Act by the courts, which have found that only extrinsic fraud - conduct of the prevailing party that deprived the losing party of an adequate opportunity to present its case - is sufficient under the 1962 Act. Examples of extrinsic fraud would be when the plaintiff deliberately had the initiating process served on the defendant at the wrong address, deliberately gave the defendant wrong information as to the time and place of the hearing, or obtained a default judgment against the defendant based on a forged confession of judgment. When this type of fraudulent action by the plaintiff deprives the defendant of an adequate opportunity to present its case, then it provides grounds for denying recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Extrinsic fraud should be distinguished from intrinsic fraud, such as false testimony of a witness or admission of a forged document into evidence during the foreign proceeding. Intrinsic fraud does not provide a basis for denying recognition under subsection 4(c)(2), as the assertion that intrinsic fraud has occurred should be raised and dealt with in the rendering court.

       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol18">
        The public policy exception in subsection 4(c)(3) is based on the public policy exception in subsection 4(b)(3) of the 1962 Act, with one difference. The public policy exception in the 1962 Act states that the relevant inquiry is whether "the [cause of action] [claim for relief] on which the judgment is based" is repugnant to public policy. Based on this "cause of action" language, some courts interpreting the 1962 Act have refused to find that a public policy challenge based on something other than repugnancy of the foreign cause of action comes within this exception. E.g., Southwest Livestock & Trucking Co., Inc. v. Ramon, 169 F.3d 317 (5th Cir. 1999) (refusing to deny recognition to Mexican judgment on promissory note with interest rate of 48% because cause of action to collect on promissory note does not violate public policy ); Guinness PLC v. Ward, 955 F.2d 875 (4th Cir. 1992) (challenge to recognition based on post-judgment settlement could not be asserted under public policy exception); The Society of Lloyd's v. Turner, 303 F.3d 325 (5th Cir. 2002) (rejecting argument legal standards applied to establish elements of breach of contract violated public policy because cause of action for breach of contract itself is not contrary to state public policy); cf. Bachchan v. India Abroad Publications, Inc., 585 N.Y.S.2d 661 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1992) (judgment creditor argued British libel judgment should be recognized despite argument it violated First Amendment because New York recognizes a cause of action for libel). Subsection 4(c)(3) rejects this narrow focus by providing that the forum court may deny recognition if either the cause of action or the judgment itself violates public policy. Cf. Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 482(2)(d) (1986) (containing a similarly-worded public policy exception to recognition).
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol19">
        Subsection 4(c)(5) allows the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment when the parties had a valid agreement, such as a valid forum selection clause or agreement to arbitrate, providing that the relevant dispute would be resolved in a forum other than the forum issuing the foreign-country judgment. Under this provision, the forum court must find both the existence of a valid agreement and that the agreement covered the subject matter involved in the foreign litigation resulting in the foreign-country judgment.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol110">
        Subsection 4(c)(6) authorizes the forum court to refuse recognition of a foreign-country judgment that was rendered in the foreign country solely on the basis of personal service when the forum court believes the original action should have been dismissed by the court in the foreign country on grounds of forum non conveniens.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol111">
        Subsection 4(c)(7) is new. Under this subsection, the forum court may deny recognition to a foreign-country judgment if there are circumstances that raise substantial doubt about the integrity of the rendering court with respect to that judgment. It requires a showing of corruption in the particular case that had an impact on the judgment that was rendered. This provision may be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1), which requires that the forum court refuse recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it was rendered under a judicial system that does not provide impartial tribunals. Like the comparable provision in subsection 4(a)(1) of the 1962 Act, subsection 4(b)(1) focuses on the judicial system of the foreign country as a whole, rather than on whether the particular judicial proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment was impartial and fair. See, e.g., The Society of Lloyd's v. Turner, 303 F.3d 325, 330 (5th Cir. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act); CIBC Mellon Trust Co. v. Mora Hotel Corp,. N.V., 743 N.Y.S.2d 408, 415 (N.Y. App. 2002) (interpreting the 1962 Act); Society of Lloyd's v. Ashenden, 233 F.3d 473, 477 (7th Cir. 2000) (interpreting the 1962 Act). On the other hand, subsection 4(c)(7) allows the court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if it finds a lack of impartiality and fairness of the tribunal in the individual proceeding leading to the foreign- country judgment. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that corruption and bribery is so prevalent throughout the judicial system of the foreign country as to make that entire judicial system one that does not provide impartial tribunals versus showing that bribery of the judge in the proceeding that resulted in the particular foreign-country judgment under consideration had a sufficient impact on the ultimate judgment as to call it into question.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol112">
        Subsection 4(c)(8) also is new. It allows the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the court finds that the specific proceeding in the foreign court was not compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. Like subsection 4(c)(7), it can be contrasted with subsection 4(b)(1), which requires the forum court to deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the forum court finds that the entire judicial system in the foreign country where the foreign-country judgment was rendered does not provide procedures compatible with the requirements of fundamental fairness. While the focus of subsection 4(b)(1) is on the foreign country's judicial system as a whole, the focus of subsection 4(c)(8) is on the particular proceeding that resulted in the specific foreign-country judgment under consideration. Thus, the difference is that between showing, for example, that there has been such a breakdown of law and order in the particular foreign country that judgments are rendered on the basis of political decisions rather than the rule of law throughout the judicial system versus a showing that for political reasons the particular party against whom the foreign-country judgment was entered was denied fundamental fairness in the particular proceedings leading to the foreign-country judgment.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1853-officialcommentol113">
        Under subsection 4(d), the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment has the burden of establishing that one of the grounds for nonrecognition set out in subsection 4(b) or (c) applies. The 1962 Act was silent as to who had the burden of proof to establish a ground for nonrecognition and courts applying the 1962 Act took different positions on the issue. Compare Bridgeway Corp. v. Citibank, 45 F. Supp. 2d 276, 285 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (plaintiff has burden to show no mandatory basis under 4(a) for nonrecognition exists; defendant has burden regarding discretionary bases) with The Courage Co. LLC v. The ChemShare Corp., 93 S.W.3d 323, 331 (Tex. App. 2002) (party seeking to avoid recognition has burden to prove ground for nonrecognition). Because the grounds for nonrecognition in Section 4 are in the nature of defenses to recognition, the burden of proof is most appropriately allocated to the party opposing recognition of the foreign-country judgment.

       Although subsection 4(c)(3) of this Act rejects the narrow focus on the cause of action under the 1962 Act, it retains the stringent test for finding a public policy violation applied by courts interpreting the 1962 Act. Under that test, a difference in law, even a marked one, is not sufficient to raise a public policy issue. Nor is it relevant that the foreign law allows a recovery that the forum state would not allow. Public policy is violated only if recognition or enforcement of the foreign-country judgment would tend clearly to injure the public health, the public morals, or the public confidence in the administration of law, or would undermine "that sense of security for individual rights, whether of personal liberty or of private property, which any citizen ought to feel." Hunt v. BP Exploration Co. (Libya) Ltd., 492 F. Supp. 885, 901 (N.D. Tex. 1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The language "or of the United States" in subsection 4(c)(3), which does not appear in the 1962 Act provision, makes it clear that the relevant public policy is that of both the State in which recognition is sought and that of the United States. This is the position taken by the vast majority of cases interpreting the 1962 public policy provision.
       <i>
        E.g.
       </i>
       , Bachchan v. India Abroad Publications, Inc., 585 N.Y.S.2d 661 (Sup.Ct. N.Y. 1992) (British libel judgment denied recognition because it violates First Amendment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections 4(c)(7) and (8) both are discretionary grounds for denying recognition, while subsection 4(b)(1) is mandatory. Obviously, if the entire judicial system in the foreign country fails to satisfy the requirements of impartiality and fundamental fairness, a judgment rendered in that foreign country would be so compromised that the forum court should refuse to recognize it as a matter of course. On the other hand, if the problem is evidence of a lack of integrity or fundamental fairness with regard to the particular proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment, then there may or may not be other factors in the particular case that would cause the forum court to decide to recognize the foreign-country judgment. For example, a forum court might decide not to exercise its discretion to deny recognition despite evidence of corruption or procedural unfairness in a particular case because the party resisting recognition failed to raise the issue on appeal from the foreign-country judgment in the foreign country, and the evidence establishes that, if the party had done so, appeal would have been an adequate mechanism for correcting the transgressions of the lower court.

        NORTH CAROLINA COMMENT

      <p>
       In subsection (a), the General Statutes Commission substituted "Except as otherwise provided in this section" for the Uniform Act language "Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c)."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission substituted "shall not" for "may not" in the introductory language of subsection (b) to conform to the drafting style used in this State for prohibitions.
   In subdivision (b)(1), the Commission inserted "taken as a whole" to make it clear that the subdivision is intended to require the forum court to view the judicial system in the foreign country as a whole in deciding whether the system provides "impartial tribunals or procedures compatible with the requirements of due process of law."

       4, Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       In subsection (c), the Commission revised the Uniform Act's introductory language to make it clear that, under normal circumstances, a court will deny recognition of a foreign-country money judgment if it finds the existence of any of the grounds for nonrecognition stated in the subsection.
   Under subsection 4(c) of the Uniform Act, whether to deny recognition when one of these grounds has been established is discretionary.
   The Commission concluded that the revision will provide a greater level of predictability in the outcome of recognition actions.
   As a result of this modification, the
   Uniform Act's Official Comment on subsection (c) should be disregarded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (c)(3) uses the terms "cause of action" and "claim for relief" because, while "claim for relief" is used in the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, both terms are used in the North Carolina General Statutes.
   No substantive change is intended by the use of both terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       The substance of subdivision (c)(4) in the Uniform Act, which allows the forum court to deny recognition of a foreign-country judgment if the court finds that the judgment conflicts with another final and conclusive judgment, is covered by subsections (d) and (e).
      </p>
      <p>
       In subdivision (c)(8), the Commission substituted "fundamentally unfair" for "not compatible with the requirements of due process of law" to conform the statutory text to language in the Official Comment to Section 4 of the Uniform Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsections (d) and (e) are not part of the Uniform Act. These subsections adopt a modified last-in-time rule for recognition of conflicting foreign-country judgments.

       - Defendant's contention, that the North Carolina Foreign Money Judgments Recognition Act had nothing to do with the facts of the case because defendant was not seeking to enforce his Honduran judgment in North Carolina, was unavailing; the Act does not govern the enforcement of foreign judgments, but pertains only to whether a court should recognize the judgment. Pursuant to former G.S. 1C-1804(b)(5), the court did not need to recognize the Honduran judgments. VF Jeanswear Ltd. P'ship v. Molina, 320 F. Supp. 2d 412 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

       Enforcement of Foreign Judgments.
   
   - Although the Israeli order in the husband and wife's divorce case was not a "foreign judgment" under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA) because the order was not the order of a United States court or a state court, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the wife and in recognizing that the husband owed a certain sum to the wife under the Israeli order; the wife made it clear in the wife's complaint that the wife was proceeding under the North Carolina Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (NCFMJRA), which included in its definition of foreign state any governmental unit other than the United States, and thus the trial court could recognize the wife's rights under the NCFMJRA that would allow the wife to later pursue enforcement of the Israeli order under the UEFJA.

       Once a foreign judgment is recognized, a plaintiff must still satisfy the North Carolina Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (Enforcement Act), G.S. 1C-1701 et seq., because the North Carolina Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act, G.S. 1C-1850 et seq., does not govern the enforcement of foreign judgments.

   - Two English citizens were entitled to have a foreign judgment recognized, pursuant to the North Carolina Uniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act, G.S. 1C-1850 et seq., because the citizens' motion was properly before the trial court, as the Act did not require that the opposing party was to be given an opportunity to file an answer before the court could hold a hearing in the matter and the opposing party did not offer evidence or argument to satisfy its burden of proof in opposing recognition.

       Scottish judgment for attorney's fees against a girlfriend in the girlfriend's unsuccessful suit against a boyfriend for maintenance was properly recognized because the girlfriend did not show the Scottish proceeding was fundamentally unfair or repugnant to North Carolina public policy as (1) the girlfriend invoked the court's jurisdiction and did not appeal the judgment or participate in proceedings leading to the judgment, (2) nor was corruption required to deny recognition shown, and (3) differing Scottish and North Carolina attorney's fee law raised no public policy issue.

       Source: This provision is based on Section 5 of the 1962 Act. Its substance is the same as that of Section 5 of the 1962 Act, except as noted in Comment 2 below with regard to subsection 5(a)(4).

        Under section 4(b)(2), the forum court must deny recognition to the foreign-country judgment if the foreign court did not have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. Section 5(a) lists six bases for personal jurisdiction that are adequate as a matter of law to establish that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction. Section 5(b) makes it clear that these bases of personal jurisdiction are not exclusive. The forum court may find that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant on some other basis.

        Subsection 5(a)(4) of the 1962 Act provides that the foreign court had personal jurisdiction over the defendant if the defendant was "a body corporate" that "had its principal place of business, was incorporated, or had otherwise acquired corporate status, in the foreign state." Subsection 5(a)(4) of this Act extends that concept to forms of business organization other than corporations.

        Subsection 5(a)(3) provides that the foreign court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant if the defendant agreed before commencement of the proceeding leading to the foreign-country judgment to submit to the jurisdiction of the foreign court with regard to the subject matter involved.

        NORTH CAROLINA COMMENT
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       In subsection (a), the General Statutes Commission substituted "shall not" for "may not" in the introductory language to conform to the drafting style used in this State for prohibitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In subdivisions (a)(5) and (a)(6), the Uniform Act indicates that states should choose either "cause of action" or "claim for relief," depending on usage in that state.
   The Commission decided to use both terms because both are used in the North Carolina General Statutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (a)(7) has no counterpart in the Uniform Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       In subsection (b), the Commission inserted "reasonable."
   As amended, subsection (b) permits the courts of this State to recognize bases of personal jurisdiction other than those listed in subsection (a) as sufficient to support a foreign-country money judgment.
   Although these may not necessarily comply in every detail with the requirements for personal jurisdiction that have evolved under the Due Process Clause, they must be reasonable.
   As an example, some countries allow the exercise of jurisdiction over a subsidiary if there is jurisdiction over the parent.
   Such an exercise of jurisdiction would be reasonable.

   - Foreign judgment that the judgment creditor obtained in New York was entitled to a presumption that the judgment was entitled to full faith and credit, as the judgment creditor met its burden of showing that entitlement by filing a properly authenticated judgment; however, the general contractor timely moved for relief from the foreign judgment by raising the defense that the New York trial court that entered it did not have personal jurisdiction over the general contractor, and because the trial court did not make any findings of fact or conclusions of law regarding the motion to enforce the judgment, the conclusion that the foreign judgment was enforceable in North Carolina was not supported by competent evidence and the case had to be remanded to the trial court for further proceedings.

        Unlike the 1962 Act, which was silent as to the proper procedure for seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment, Section 6 of this Act expressly sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition may be raised. Under section 6, the issue of recognition always must be raised in a court proceeding. Thus, section 6 rejects decisions under the 1962 Act holding that the registration procedure found in the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act could be utilized with regard to recognition of a foreign-country judgment. E.g. Society of Lloyd's v. Ashenden, 233 F.3d 473 (7th Cir. 2000). The Enforcement Act deals solely with the enforcement of sister-state judgments and other judgments entitled to full faith and credit, not with the recognition of foreign-country judgments.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1855-officialcommentol12">
        This Section contemplates that the issue of recognition may be raised either as an original matter or in the context of a pending proceeding. Subsection 6(a) provides that in order to raise the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment as an initial matter, the party seeking recognition must file an action for recognition of the foreign-country judgment. Subsection 6(b) provides that when the recognition issue is raised in a pending proceeding, it may be raised by counterclaim, cross-claim or affirmative defense, depending on the context in which it is raised. These rules are consistent with the way the issue of recognition most often was raised in most states under the 1962 Act.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1855-officialcommentol13">
        An action seeking recognition of a foreign-country judgment under this Section is an action on the foreign-country judgment itself, not an action on the underlying cause of action that gave rise to that judgment. The parties to an action under Section 6 may not relitigate the merits of the underlying dispute that gave rise to the foreign-country judgment.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1855-officialcommentol14">
        While this Section sets out the ways in which the issue of recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be raised, it is not intended to create any new procedure not currently existing in the state or to otherwise effect existing state procedural requirements. The parties to an action in which recognition of a foreign-country judgment is sought under Section 6 must comply with all state procedural rules with regard to that type of action. Nor does this Act address the question of what constitutes a sufficient basis for jurisdiction to adjudicate with regard to an action under Section 6. Courts have split over the issue of whether the presence of assets of the debtor in a state is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction in light of footnote 36 of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 210 n.36 (1977). This Act takes no position on that issue.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1855-officialcommentol15">
        In states that have adopted the Uniform Foreign-Money Claims Act, that Act will apply to the determination of the amount of a money judgment recognized under this Act.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       More broadly, section 6 rejects the use of any registration procedure in the context of the foreign-country judgments covered by this Act. A registration procedure represents a balance between the interest of the judgment creditor in obtaining quick and efficient recognition and enforcement of a judgment when the judgment debtor has already been provided with an opportunity to litigate the underlying issues, and the interest of the judgment debtor in being provided an adequate opportunity to raise and litigate issues regarding whether the foreign-country judgment should be recognized. In the context of sister-state judgments, this balance favors use of a truncated procedure such as that found in the Enforcement Act. Recognition of sister-state judgments normally is mandated by the Full Faith and Credit Clause. Courts recognize only a very limited number of grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment - that the rendering court lacked jurisdiction, that the judgment was procured by fraud, that the judgment has been satisfied, or that the limitations period has expired. Thus, the judgment debtor with regard to a sister-state judgment normally does not have any grounds for opposing recognition and enforcement of the judgment. The extremely limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment reflect the fact such judgments will have been rendered by a court that is subject to the same due process limitations and the same overlap of federal statutory and constitutional law as the forum state's courts, and, to a large extent, the same body of court precedent and socio-economic ideas as those shaping the law of the forum state. Therefore, there is a strong presumption of fairness and competence attached to a sister-state judgment that justifies use of a registration procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
       The balance between the benefits and costs of a registration procedure is significantly different, however, in the context of recognition and enforcement of foreign-country judgments. Unlike the limited grounds for denying full faith and credit to a sister-state judgment, this Act provides a number of grounds upon which recognition of a foreign-country judgment may be denied. Determination of whether these grounds apply requires the forum court to look behind the foreign-country judgment to evaluate the law and the judicial system under which the foreign-country judgment was rendered. The existence of these grounds for nonrecognition reflects the fact there is less expectation that foreign-country courts will follow procedures comporting with U.S. notions of fundamental fairness and jurisdiction or that those courts will apply laws viewed as substantively tolerable by U.S. standards than there is with regard to sister-state courts. In some situations, there also may be suspicions of corruption or fraud in the foreign-country proceedings. These differences between sister-state judgments and foreign-country judgments provide a justification for requiring judicial involvement in the decision whether to recognize a foreign- country judgment in all cases in which that issue is raised. Although the threshold for establishing that a foreign-country judgment is not entitled to recognition under Section 4 is high, there is a sufficiently greater likelihood that significant recognition issues will be raised so as to require a judicial proceeding.

      </p>
      <p>
       The General Statutes Commission inserted "and nonrecognition" in the catchline to this section and "or nonrecognition" in subsection (b) to cover an action in which the issue of nonrecognition is raised by a party against whom a foreign-country money judgment has been entered.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, in subsection (b), the Commission replaced "a pending action" with "some other action" and inserted "complaint" in the list of ways to raise the issue of recognition to cover the situation where an action is filed for some relief other than recognition of a foreign-country money judgment, but the recognition is a necessary step in the process.

       - Defendant's contention, that the North Carolina Foreign Money Judgments Recognition Act had nothing to do with the facts of the case because defendant was not seeking to enforce his Honduran judgment in North Carolina, was unavailing; the Act does not govern the enforcement of foreign judgments, but pertains only to whether a court should recognize the judgment.

   - Although the Israeli order in the husband and wife's divorce case was not a "foreign judgment" under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA) because the order was not the order of a United States court or a state court, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the wife and in recognizing that the husband owed a certain sum to the wife under the Israeli order; the wife made it clear in the wife's complaint that the wife was proceeding under the North Carolina Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (NCFMJRA), which included in its definition of foreign state any governmental unit other than the United States, and thus the trial court could recognize the wife's rights under the NCFMJRA that would allow the wife to later pursue enforcement of the Israeli order under the UEFJA.

        Section 5 of this Act sets out the standards for the recognition of foreign-country judgments within the scope of this Act, and places an affirmative duty on the forum court to recognize any foreign-country judgment that meets those standards. Section 6 of this Act sets out the procedures by which the issue of recognition may be raised. This Section sets out the consequences of the decision by the forum court that the foreign-country judgment is entitled to recognition.

        Under subsection 7(1), the first consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that it is treated as conclusive between the parties in the forum state. Section 7(1) does not attempt to establish directly the extent of that conclusiveness. Instead, it provides that the foreign-country judgment is treated as conclusive to the same extent that a judgment of a sister state that had been determined to be entitled to full faith and credit would be conclusive. This means that the foreign-country judgment generally will be given the same effect in the forum state that it has in the foreign country where it was rendered. Subsection 7(1), however, sets out the minimum effect that must be given to the foreign-country judgment once recognized. The forum court remains free to give the foreign-country judgment a greater preclusive effect in the forum state than the judgment would have in the foreign country where it was rendered. Cf. Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, § 481 cmt c (1986).

        Under subsection 7(2), the second consequence of recognition of a foreign-country judgment is that, to the extent it grants a sum of money, it is enforceable in the forum state in accordance with the procedures for enforcement in the forum state and to the same extent that a judgment of the forum state would be enforceable. Cf. Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States §481 (1986) (judgment entitled to recognition is enforceable in accordance with the procedure for enforcement of judgments applicable where enforcement is sought). Thus, under subsection 7(2), once recognized, the foreign-country judgment has the same effect and is subject to the same procedures, defenses and proceedings for reopening, vacating, or staying a judgment of a comparable court in the forum state, and can be enforced or satisfied in the same manner as such a judgment of the forum state.

       - Defendant's contention, that the North Carolina Foreign Money Judgments Recognition Act had nothing to do with the facts of the case because defendant was not seeking to enforce his Honduran judgment in North Carolina, was unavailing; the Act does not govern the enforcement of foreign judgments, but pertains only to whether a court should recognize the judgment. Pursuant to former G.S. 1C-1804(b)(5), the court did not need to recognize the Honduran judgments. VF Jeanswear Ltd. P'ship v. Molina, 320 F. Supp. 2d 412 (M.D.N.C. 2004).

       Enforcement of Foreign Judgments.
   
   - Although the Israeli order in the husband and wife's divorce case was not a "foreign judgment" under the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA) because the order was not the order of a United States court or a state court, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the wife and in recognizing that the husband owed a certain sum to the wife under the Israeli order; the wife made it clear in the wife's complaint that the wife was proceeding under the North Carolina Foreign Money-Judgments Recognition Act (NCFMJRA), which included in its definition of foreign state any governmental unit other than the United States, and thus the trial court could recognize the wife's rights under the NCFMJRA that would allow the wife to later pursue enforcement of the Israeli order under the UEFJA.

      If a party establishes that an appeal from a foreign-country judgment is pending or will be taken, the court may stay any proceedings with regard to the foreign-country judgment until the appeal is concluded, the time for appeal expires without an appeal being taken, or the appellant has had sufficient time to prosecute the appeal and has failed to do so.

        Under Section 3 of this Act, a foreign-country judgment is not within the scope of this Act unless it is conclusive and enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the effect of appeal under the law of the foreign country in which the judgment was rendered is to prevent it from being conclusive or enforceable between the parties, the existence of a pending appeal in the foreign country would prevent the application of this Act. Section 8 addresses a different situation. It deals with the situation in which either (1) the party seeking a stay has demonstrated that it intends to file an appeal in the foreign country, although the appeal has not yet been filed or (2) an appeal has been filed in the foreign country, but under the law of the foreign country filing of an appeal does not affect the conclusiveness or enforceability of the judgment. Section 8 allows the forum court in those situations to determine in its discretion that a stay of proceedings is appropriate.

       Source: This Section is new.
   The 1962 Act did not contain a statute of limitations. Some courts applying the 1962 Act have used the state's general statute of limitations,
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , Vrozos v. Sarantopoulos, 552 N.E.2d 1053 (Ill. App. 1990) (as Recognition Act contains no statute of limitations, general five-year statute of limitations applies), while others have used the statute of limitations applicable with regard to enforcement of a domestic judgment,
       <i>
        e.g.
       </i>
       , La Societe Anonyme Goro v. Conveyor Accessories, Inc., 677 N.E. 2d 30 (Ill. App. 1997).

      <ol>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1858-officialcommentol11">
        Under Section 3 of this Act, this Act only applies to foreign-country judgments that are conclusive, and if the judgment grants recovery of a sum of money, enforceable where rendered. Thus, if the period of effectiveness of the foreign-country judgment has expired in the foreign country where the judgment was rendered, the foreign-country judgment would not be subject to this Act. This means that the period of time during which a foreign-country judgment may be recognized under this Act normally is measured by the period of time during which that judgment is effective (that is, conclusive and, if applicable, enforceable) in the foreign country that rendered the judgment. If, however, the foreign-country judgment remains effective for more than fifteen years after the date on which it became effective in the foreign country, Section 9 places an additional time limit on recognition of a foreign-country judgment. It provides that, if the foreign-country judgment remains effective between the parties for more than fifteen years, then an action to recognize the foreign-country judgment under this Act must be commenced within that fifteen year period.
       </li>
       <li id="t1Ca20s1C-1858-officialcommentol12">
        Section 9 does not address the issue of whether a foreign-country judgment that can no longer be the basis of a recognition action under this Act because of the application of the fifteen-year limitations period in Section 9 may be used for other purposes. For example, a common rule with regard to judgments barred by a statute of limitations is that they still may be used defensively for purposes of offset and for their preclusive effect. The extent to which a foreign-country judgment with regard to which a recognition action is barred by Section 9 may be used for these or other purposes is left to the other law of the forum state.

       The General Statutes Commission reduced from "15 years" to "10 years" the statute of limitations for commencing an action under the Uniform Act to recognize a foreign-country money judgment that is effective in the foreign country that rendered the judgment.
   The 10-year statute of limitations corresponds with the 10-year statute of limitations under G.S. 1-47 for commencing an action to recognize a sister-state judgment.
