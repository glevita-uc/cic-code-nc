      </b> - Session Laws 1999-293, s. 16, effective October 1, 1999, had provided: "Section 16. G.S. 110-36.3 is amended by adding a new subsection to read:" and set out a new subsection (d1). There is no G.S. 110-36.3, and G.S. 110-26
                    to 110-38 were repealed in 1969. It appears likely that the intent of the act was to add a subsection (d1) to G.S. 110-136.3. Subsequently, Session Laws 2000-140, s. 20 (a) repealed Session Laws 1999-293, s. 16, and Session Laws 2000-140,
                    s. 20(b) added a subsection (d1) to G.S. 110-136.3.

                    Guard, State military forces, or a reserve component of the Armed Forces who was ordered to active duty by the proper authority within the last 18 months or is expected to be ordered within the next 18 months, or (ii) a member of the
                    Armed Forces of the United States, including the North Carolina National Guard, State military forces, or a reserve component of the Armed Forces who was injured or killed while serving on active duty. Eligibility determinations for
                    NC Pre-K participants may continue through local education agencies and local North Carolina Partnership for Children, Inc., partnerships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Other than developmental disabilities or other chronic health issues, the Division shall not consider the health of a child as a factor in determining eligibility for participation in the NC Pre-K program.

                    a process requiring child care subsidy recipients to participate in child support services programs. To that end, DCDEE and DSS shall develop a plan requiring a custodial parent or other relative or person with primary custody of the
                    child who is receiving child care subsidy payments to cooperate with county child support services programs as a condition of receiving child care subsidy payments. In developing the plan, the DCDEE and DSS shall, at a minimum, consider
                    each of the following:
                </p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    "(3) The access and exchange of information between county child support services programs/systems and child care subsidy services/systems and any differences that may create a conflict in coordinating child care subsidy payments with child support services.

                <p>
                    "(7) The development of any forms needed to implement the plan.

                <p>
                    "(8) Transition time needed to implement the plan and to coordinate any interface with current systems, such as the North Carolina Automated Collection and Tracking System (NC ACTS) and North Carolina Families Accessing Services through Technology (NC
                    FAST).
                </p>

                        After-School Program Not a Day-Care Facility. - Court disagreed with the plaintiff's contention that after-school program was a day-care facility and a non-traditional governmental activity not entitled to governmental immunity under G.S. 115C-42, because
                        the program did not meet the statutory definition of "day-care facility" under this section, the record revealed no evidence of profits, and the fees were insubstantial.

                        No Evidence That Facility Was a Child Care Center. - Trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the statutory enhancement of his conviction for possession with intent to sell and deliver marijuana because the evidence at trial was that
                        the child care facility in question was a "facility" and "home," but not a child care "center" as defined by G.S. 110-86 as there was no evidence about how many children there actually were in the facility at any given time. State

                    <p>
                        Deprivation of Liberty Interests. - Given the evidence showing the impact of the administrative action of the Department of Health and Human Services on a child care center owner's livelihood, the owner arguably suffered a deprivation of her liberty interests,
                        necessitating a procedural due process analysis; a statutory construction treating a local department of social services substantiation as sufficient to support administrative action raised a serious concern with respect to the
                        owner's due process rights. Nanny's Korner Care Ctr. v. N.C. HHS - Div. of Child Dev., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 758 S.E.2d 423 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Department of Health And Human Services Cannot Rely on Substantiation of Abuse Made by Local Department of Social Services. - Investigatory collaboration and the sharing of evidence does not, ipso facto, absolve the North Carolina Department of Health
                        and Human Services (DHHS) of responsibility for independently determining or substantiating the occurrence of abuse; while DHHS may utilize evidence collected by the local department of social services (DSS) in its investigation,
                        DHHS may not treat a local DSS substantiation as dispositive for purposes of discipline. Nanny's Korner Care Ctr. v. N.C. HHS - Div. of Child Dev., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 758 S.E.2d
                        423 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Abuse Made by Local Department of Social Services. - Statutes and administrative rules require the Department of Health and Human Services to substantiate an accusation of abuse, and any lack of specificity in the statutes concerning the process of substantiation
                        cannot be construed to relieve DHHS of this responsibility; the statutory and administrative language places an affirmative duty on DHHS to independently substantiate abuse, thereby precluding DHHS from treating a local department
                        of social services substantiation as dispositive. Nanny's Korner Care Ctr. v. N.C. HHS - Div. of Child Dev., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 758 S.E.2d 423 (2014).

                    If it is determined, based on your criminal history, that you are unfit to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, you shall have the opportunity to complete, or challenge the accuracy of, the information contained in the SBI or
                    FBI identification records.

                    If you disagree with the determination of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services on your fitness to provide child care, you may file a civil lawsuit within 60 days after receiving written notification of disqualification in the district
                    court in the county where you live.

                    Any child care provider who intentionally falsifies any information required to be furnished to conduct the criminal history record check shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.

                    Refusal to consent to a criminal history record check or intentional falsification of any information required to be furnished to conduct a criminal history record check is grounds for the Department to prohibit the child care provider from providing
                    child care. Any child care provider who intentionally falsifies any information required to be furnished to conduct the criminal history shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A child care provider who disagrees with the Department's decision may file a civil action in the district court of the county of residence of the child care provider within 60 days after receiving written notification of disqualification. Review of the
                    Department's determination disqualifying a child care provider shall be de novo. No jury trial is available for appeals to district court under this section.

                    Effective January 1, 1998, an operator of a licensed family child care home shall be at least 21 years old and have a high school diploma or its equivalent. Operators of a family child care home licensed prior to January 1, 1998, shall be at least 18
                    years of age and literate. Literate is defined as understanding licensing requirements and having the ability to communicate with the family and relevant emergency personnel. Any operator of a licensed family child care home shall
                    be the person on-site providing child care.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Commission shall adopt standards to establish appropriate qualifications for all staff in child care centers. These standards shall reflect training, experience, education and credentialing and shall be appropriate for the size center and the level
                    of individual staff responsibilities. It is the intent of this provision to guarantee that all children in child care are cared for by qualified people. Pursuant to G.S. 110-106, no requirements may interfere with the teachings or
                    doctrine of any established religious organization. The staff qualification requirements of this subdivision do not apply to religious-sponsored child care facilities pursuant to G.S. 110-106.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All records of any child care facility, except financial records, shall be available for review by the Secretary or by duly authorized representatives of the Department or a cooperating agency who shall be designated by the Secretary and shall be submitted
                    as required by the Department.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each child care facility shall have a written policy on discipline, describing the methods and practices used to discipline children enrolled in that facility. This written policy shall be discussed with, and a copy given to, each child's parent prior
                    to the first time the child attends the facility. Subsequently, any change in discipline methods or practices shall be communicated in writing to the parents prior to the effective date of the change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The use of corporal punishment as a form of discipline is prohibited in child care facilities and may not be used by any operator or staff member of any child care facility, except that corporal punishment may be used in religious sponsored child care
                    facilities as defined in G.S. 110-106, only if (i) the religious sponsored child care facility files with the Department a notice stating that corporal punishment is part of the religious training of its program, and (ii) the religious
                    sponsored child care facility clearly states in its written policy of discipline that corporal punishment is part of the religious training of its program. The written policy on discipline of nonreligious sponsored child care facilities
                    shall clearly state the prohibition on corporal punishment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These standards shall include annual requirements for ongoing staff development appropriate to job responsibilities. A person may carry forward in-service training hours that are in excess of the previous year's requirement to meet up to one-half of the
                    current year's required in-service training hours.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ratio of adults to children in child care vehicles may not be less than the staff/child ratios prescribed by G.S. 110-91(7). The Commission shall adopt standards for transporting children under the age of two, including standards addressing this particular
                    age's staff/child ratio during transportation.

                        Deprivation of Liberty Interests. - Given the evidence showing the impact of the administrative action of the Department of Health and Human Services on a child care center owner's livelihood, the owner arguably suffered a deprivation of her liberty interests,
                        necessitating a procedural due process analysis; a statutory construction treating a local department of social services substantiation as sufficient to support administrative action raised a serious concern with respect to the

                        Department of Health And Human Services Cannot Rely on Substantiation of Abuse Made by Local Department of Social Services. - Superior court erred in affirming the decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), which issued
                        a written warning to an owner's child care center, because DHHS could not rely on a substantiation of abuse made by a local department of social services to invoke its disciplinary authority; the owner was not afforded the ability
                        to challenge the evidence or cross-examine the person who substantiated the abuse. Nanny's Korner Care Ctr. v. N.C. HHS - Div. of Child Dev., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 758 S.E.2d 423

                        Abuse Made by Local Department of Social Services. - Investigatory collaboration and the sharing of evidence does not, ipso facto, absolve the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) of responsibility for independently determining
                        or substantiating the occurrence of abuse; while DHHS may utilize evidence collected by the local department of social services (DSS) in its investigation, DHHS may not treat a local DSS substantiation as dispositive for purposes
                        of discipline. Nanny's Korner Care Ctr. v. N.C. HHS - Div. of Child Dev., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. App.</cite> 51, 758 S.E.2d 423 (2014).

                        The report may be made orally, by telephone, or in writing. The report shall include information as is known to the person making the report, including (i) the name and address of the child care facility where the child was allegedly
                        maltreated, (ii) the name and address of the child's parent, guardian, or caretaker, (iii) the age of the child, (iv) the present whereabouts of the child if not at the home address, (v) the nature and extent of any injury or condition

                        Intervention in Support Action Brought by State. - The language of G.S. 110-137 operates to assign to the state or county only the right to reimbursement for those amounts of support money provided through AFDC. Thus grandmother who had cared for child
                        since her birth and had applied for assistance from the AFDC program retained her interest in defendant father's support obligation, and was entitled to intervene in an action for child support brought against defendant by the
                        State. State ex rel. Crews v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 354</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 501 (1987).

                        Blood Test Appropriate. - Court did not err in ordering defendant to submit to a blood grouping test where blood test evidence demonstrated that another man was not the father and defendant admitted to having had sexual relations with plaintiff at the
                        approximate time of conception. Guilford County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Unit ex rel. Gardner v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 473 S.E.2d 640 (1996).

                        Award of Attorney's Fees to the Putative Father. - Trial court abused the court's discretion by ordering a mother to pay a portion of a putative father's attorney's fees, once the putative father was proven not to be the biological father of the mother's
                        child because the assessment of attorney's fees to the mother was contrary to the stated purposes in G.S. 110-128. Guilford County ex rel. Holt v. Puckett, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 693,

                        Responsible Parent Remains Liable for Future Support. - Section 49-7, read together with G.S. 50-13.7, clearly contemplates a continuing obligation on the part of the parents of an illegitimate child to provide support, including when necessary the modification
                        or increase of payments ordered to satisfy this obligation. Having been conclusively determined a "responsible parent," as that term is defined in this section, the father of an illegitimate child must necessarily remain liable
                        for the future support of his minor child. Wilkes County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Nations v. Gentry, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 580</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 224 (1984).

                        Plea of guilty may be considered as evidentiary admission by defendant on issue of paternity, where defendant makes no attempt to refute or explain this evidence and it is therefore uncontroverted. It is unnecessary to determine whether defendant's plea
                        of guilty to an earlier criminal charge of nonsupport must be given collateral estoppel effect. Wilkes County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Nations v. Gentry, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 580</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The credible, uncontroverted evidence of defendant's plea of guilty to a criminal charge of nonsupport of the minor child is sufficient to establish paternity so as to bring defendant within the definition of "responsible parent" under this section. That
                        definition includes "the father of an illegitimate child." Wilkes County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Nations v. Gentry, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 580</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 224 (1984).

                        Appellate Jurisdiction. - Appellate court had no jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a denial of child support modification in a IV-D case because (1) an order continuing an existing order until legally interdependent custody issues could be heard was interlocutory,
                        as, without knowing the custody arrangement, a trial court could not find which child support worksheet to use, or whether to deviate from the guidelines, (2) the order did not resolve the custody issue, and (3) allowing an appeal
                        would lead to an unnecessary appeal. Gray v. Peele, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. App.</cite> 554, 761 S.E.2d 739 (2014).

                    where the child resides or is found. Any legal proceeding instituted under this section may be based upon information or belief. The parent of the child may be subpoenaed for testimony at the trial of the action to establish the paternity
                    of and/or to obtain support for the child either instituted or taken up by the designated representative of the county commissioners. The husband-wife privilege shall not be grounds for excusing the mother or father from testifying
                    at the trial nor shall said privilege be grounds for the exclusion of confidential communications between husband and wife. If a parent called for examination declines to answer upon the grounds that his testimony may tend to incriminate
                    him, the court may require him to answer in which event he shall not thereafter be prosecuted for any criminal act involved in the conception of the child whose paternity is in issue and/or for whom support is sought, except for perjury

                        County has the authority and the duty to pursue an action against the responsible parent for the maintenance of the child and recovery of amounts paid by the county for support of the child. The county may bring the action in the name of the mother or
                        in its own name. She is in either case required to cooperate with the county in the trial of the action. Settle ex rel. Sullivan v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 616</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 288 (1983).

                        County is the real party in interest in an action to recover amounts paid by the county for support of a child. The child's mother is not the real party in interest. By accepting public assistance, she assigned her right to child support to the county.

                        County Not Estopped by Non-Paternity Ruling in Former Criminal Matter, as County Not in Privity with State. - Although State and county were interested in proving same state of facts (that defendant was child's father), county had no control over previous
                        criminal litigation where it was determined that defendant was not father, and nothing in record indicated that interest of county was legally represented in criminal trial. Accordingly, trial court erred in concluding that county
                        was in privity with State, and doctrine of collateral estoppel did not bar county's action against defendant in its effort to seek reimbursement for public assistance paid on behalf of child. County of Rutherford ex rel. Child

                        Past Public Assistance Debt Owed by Indian. - The exercise of state court jurisdiction over paternity actions, where the mother, the child, and the putative father are all Indians living on the reservation, unduly infringes on tribal self-governance.
                        However, once paternity is established, the state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over causes of action brought by the State pursuant to requirements of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program to collect a debt
                        owed to the State for past public assistance and to obtain a judgement for future child support. Jackson County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Jackson v. Swayney, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 52</cite>,

                        Intervention. - Child support enforcement agencies have an unconditional statutory right of intervention where a person has accepted public assistance on behalf of a dependent child, where that person applies for and pays a fee for child support collection
                        services, or where that person with an order under which the person is entitled to collect spousal support is also receiving child support enforcement services for a child support obligation. Therefore, a child support enforcement
                        agency had an unconditional statutory right to intervene in an ongoing support dispute pending between two parents because a mother had contracted for child support services, and the motion was timely where it was filed one month
                        after services were sought. Robbins v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 784 S.E.2d 219 (2016).

                    The court must also find that all parties, including the child support enforcement agency, if appropriate, have been served in accordance with Rule 4 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. In the event the court orders rescission
                    and the putative father is thereafter found not to be the father of the child, then the clerk of court shall send a copy of the order of rescission to the State Registrar of Vital Statistics. Upon receipt of an order of rescission,
                    the State Registrar shall remove the putative father's name from the birth certificate. In the event that the putative father defaults or fails to present or prosecute the issue of paternity, the trial court shall find the putative

                    The burden of proof in any motion to set aside an affidavit of parentage after 60 days allowed for rescission shall be on the moving party. Upon proper motion alleging fraud, duress, mutual mistake, or excusable neglect, the court shall order the child's
                    mother, the child whose parentage is at issue, and the putative father to submit to genetic paternity testing pursuant to G.S. 8-50.1(b1). If the court determines, as a result of genetic testing, the putative father is not the biological
                    father of the child and the affidavit of parentage was entered as a result of fraud, duress, mutual mistake, or excusable neglect, the court may set aside the affidavit of parentage. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to
                    affect the presumption of legitimacy where a child is born to a mother and the putative father during the course of a marriage.

                        Legislative Intent. - Judgments of paternity clearly impact heavily on the property interests, liberty interests, and family relationships of the purported father. If the General Assembly intends that such judgments, once entered, are unalterable, regardless
                        of the circumstances, it should expressly so state. The courts are unwilling, by judicial fiat in the process of statutory interpretation, to impose a rule so inflexible and with such potential for manifestly unjust results. Leach
                        v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 304 S.E.2d 265 (1983).

                        The apparent legislative purpose in enactment of the "shall be res judicata . . . and shall not be reconsidered" provision in the portion of the statute relating solely to support proceedings (subsection (b)) was to avert costly consumption of the finite
                        time resources of the trial courts by relitigation, in proceedings relating solely to support, of the underlying paternity issue. The absence of such a provision from the portion of the statute relating to the paternity issue (subsection
                        (a)) itself, together with the manifest potential for substantial injustice which would result from inability, regardless of the circumstances, to obtain relief from an acknowledgment of paternity (now affidavit of parentage),
                        indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to render court approved acknowledgments of paternity (now affidavits of parentage) a unique category of judgments, peculiarly immune from the grand reservoir of equitable power
                        to do justice in a particular case provided by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 60(b)(6). If such were the case, relief would not
                        be possible, for example, even from an acknowledgment (now affidavit) entered under extreme duress, such as a threat of death issued with the apparent means and intent to effectuate it. Leach v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite>                        118, 304 S.E.2d 265 (1983).

                        The legislature did not intend for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50</a></cite> to control all actions for child support. Reading <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html" target="_blank">Chapter 50</a></cite>                        together with this chapter, the more specific provisions of this chapter dealing with the procedure for determining and enforcing support obligations of a father who voluntarily acknowledges paternity (now affidavit of parentage)
                        prevails over any conflicting procedure in Chapter 50 for determining and enforcing custody and support of minor children. Wake County ex rel. Horton v. Ryles, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 437 S.E.2d 404 (1993).

                        The purpose of a child support proceeding is to determine the nature and extent of the support required. The initial determination is subject to modification or vacation at any time upon motion and a showing of changed circumstances. The support issue
                        thus may be before the court on numerous occasions during a child's minority. Leach v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 118, 304 S.E.2d 265 (1983).

                        Effect of Subsection (a). - Subsection (a) makes a father's voluntary written acknowledgment of paternity (now affidavit of parentage) and agreement to support his illegitimate child a binding and fully enforceable substitute for a judicial determination
                        of paternity and order of support. Durham County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 112, 277 S.E.2d 865 (1981).

                        Father's Acknowledgment (Affidavit) To Be Sworn and Accompanied by Mother's. - The court may not approve defendant's voluntary agreement for support of an illegitimate child where defendant's acknowledgment of paternity (now affidavit of parentage) is
                        not simultaneously accompanied by a sworn affirmation of paternity (now affidavit of parentage) by the child's mother as required by this section. Durham County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Williams,

                        Although this section allows a written acknowledgment of paternity (now affidavit of parentage) in lieu of any legal proceeding instituted to establish paternity in actions to enforce duties of support under this chapter, such an acknowledgment (now affidavit)
                        must be sworn to before a certifying officer or notary public, and accompanied by a written affirmation of paternity (now affidavit of parentage) executed and sworn to by the mother of the dependent child for whom support is sought.

                        Legitimation, Not Acknowledgment, Necessary to Rebut Presumption in Favor of Mother. - There are significant differences between the procedures outlined for acknowledgment of paternity in an agreement to provide child support and those governing legitimation
                        of a child; where child's father had not taken any steps to legitimate the child, by statute or judicial determination, his execution of an acknowledgment of paternity did not erase the common law presumption in favor of the mother's
                        custody of the child. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 250, 563 S.E.2d 248, cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 166</cite>, 568 S.E.2d 610 (2002).

                    <p>
                        As the common-law rule that custody of an illegitimate child presumptively vested in the mother was abrogated by G.S. 50-13.2(a), the trial court properly applied the "best interest of the child" standard in awarding custody to the child's father, who
                        had acknowledged his paternity under G.S. 110-132(a), paid child support without a court order, and provided that child with a stable and structured life. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 193</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Illegitimate child's father who has acknowledged his paternity under G.S. 110-132(a) and whose conduct is consistent with his right to care for and control his child has a right to custody of his illegitimate child legally equal to that of the child's
                        mother, and, pursuant to G.S. 50-13.2, if the best interest of the child is served by placing the child in the father's custody, he is to be awarded custody of that child. Rosero v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 193</cite>,
                        581 S.E.2d 41 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1177, 124 S. Ct. 1407, 158 L. Ed. 2d 78 (2004).

                        Standing of County in Action to Modify Support Order. - Where plaintiff mother, who received public assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children Program, assigned to a county her right to receive any support on behalf of her children,
                        the county, by virtue of the assignment pursuant to this section, had an interest in the order for the support of plaintiff's children. Therefore, under G.S. 50-13.7(a), the county had standing to make a motion in an action between
                        plaintiff mother and defendant father to modify a child support order to require that the support be paid to the county. Cox v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 260 S.E.2d 812 (1979).

                    <p>
                        A trial court had no authority to dismiss a county's action to show cause for nonpayment of child support, where the putative father had earlier acknowledged paternity under oath and had entered into a voluntary support agreement. Holt v. Shoffner,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 304 S.E.2d 787 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Notice to Putative Father. - Three requirements must be met to enter an order for child support "on the acknowledgment of paternity (now affidavit of parentage)": (1) the putative father's acknowledgment of paternity (now affidavit of parentage) must
                        be filed, (2) an interested party must make an application for an order to show cause, and (3) the court or any judge thereof must cause a summons to be issued requiring the putative father to appear in court to show cause why
                        the court should not enter an order for support of the child. These requirements provide sufficient notice to a putative father who has had a judgment of paternity entered against him pursuant to subsection (a) of this section
                        for the court to enter an order for child support on this judgment. Wake County ex rel. Horton v. Ryles, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 437 S.E.2d 404 (1993).

                        Relitigation of Paternity Precluded in Support Proceeding. - A voluntary support agreement may, upon motion and a showing of changed circumstances, be modified or vacated at any time. It cannot, however, be modified or vacated on the basis of relitigation,
                        in a proceeding related solely to the order for support, of the paternity issue. That issue is res judicata and shall not be reconsidered by the court in such a proceeding. Person County ex rel. Lester v. Holloway,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 329 S.E.2d 713 (1985).

                    <p>
                        Where, twelve years before trial, defendant acknowledged that he was the natural father of a child by executing and filing with the court an acknowledgment of paternity (now affidavit of parentage), and by executing and filing an agreement to pay $65.00
                        per month for care and benefit of the child, the trial court improperly ordered blood test to determine whether the putative father was the biological father of the child in an action to enforce child support payments. Sampson
                        County Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. McNeil v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 719, 400 S.E.2d 776 (1991).

                        Voluntary Support Agreement Used To Establish Right To Inherit. - G.S. 110-132 does not imply that voluntary support agreements are strictly limited such that they may have no legal implications other than that of child support; it acknowledges that voluntary
                        support agreements, when properly acknowledged and approved by a trial court, have the same force and effect as a trial court's order of support. Accordingly, a voluntary support agreement could be used to establish that an out-of-wedlock
                        child was entitled to inherit under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a06s29-19ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 29-19(b)</a></cite>. In re Estate of Potts, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite>                        460, 651 S.E.2d 297 (2007).

                    <p>
                        The defendant was not barred from contesting paternity pursuant to G.S. 8-50.1(b1) where the issue had not been litigated and where the defendant never formally acknowledged paternity in the manner prescribed by G.S. 110-132; furthermore, the defendant
                        was not required to present evidence that another man had acknowledged paternity in order for the court to authorize the test. Ambrose v. Ambrose, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 536 S.E.2d

                        Time Limit for Motion to Set Aside Acknowledgement of Paternity. - Order for the parties to submit to a paternity test was error because a father's motion to set aside his acknowledgment of paternity was filed over seven years after the acknowledgement
                        was filed, but the one-year time period for seeking relief under G.S. 1A-1-60(b) applied to challenges under G.S. 110-132(a). County of Durham DSS ex rel. Stevons v. Charles, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite>                        505, 642 S.E.2d 482 (2007).

                        Termination of Parental Rights. - No evidence supported terminating a father's parental rights for failure to legitimate the children because no evidence was adduced showing (1) the children were born out of wedlock; or (2) when the petition was filed,
                        the father did not file a paternity affidavit or petition to legitimate the children, legitimate the children by marrying the children's mother, or establish paternity in court; and (3) a proffer that the father did not pay support
                        or provide gifts or clothes since the children were in foster care did not suffice. In re L.S., <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 565, 822 S.E.2d 506 (2018).

                    Acceptance of public assistance by or on behalf of a dependent child creates a debt, in the amount of public assistance paid, due and owing the State by the responsible parent or parents of the child. Provided, however, that in those cases in which child
                    support was required to be paid incident to a court order during the time of receipt of public assistance, the debt shall be limited to the amount specified in such court order. This liability shall attach only to public assistance
                    granted subsequent to June 30, 1975, and only with respect to the period of time during which public assistance is granted, and only if the responsible parent or parents were financially able to furnish support during this period.

                <p>
                    The United States, the State of North Carolina, and any county within the State which has provided public assistance to or on behalf of a dependent child shall be entitled to share in any sum collected under this section, and their proportionate parts
                    of such sum shall be determined in accordance with the matching formulas in use during the period for which assistance was paid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No action to collect such debt shall be commenced after the expiration of five years subsequent to the receipt of the last grant of public assistance. The county attorney or an attorney retained by the county and/or State shall represent the State in
                    all proceedings brought under this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A past-due public assistance debt as described in this section may be deemed negotiable and subject to reduction if the public assistance debt is not less than fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) and the responsible parent continues to be obligated to
                    pay current child support. Upon agreement between the State and the responsible parent, and upon approval of the court upon an inquiry into the financial status of the obligor, the responsible parent shall pay all child support payments,
                    including payments due on child support arrears, entered by a valid court order for a 24-month period of time. Upon the timely payment of each court-ordered child support obligation during the full 24-month period, including payments
                    due on child support arrears, the State shall reduce the responsible parent's public assistance debt by two-thirds. If the responsible parent is late or defaults on any single payment during the 24-month period, no portion of the public
                    assistance debt shall be reduced. The responsible parent may attempt to achieve 24 consecutive months of child support payments as often as possible in order to reduce his or her public assistance debt. However, once the responsible
                    parent's public assistance debt has been reduced by two-thirds because of the successful completion of this agreement, the responsible parent shall no longer be eligible for this program. The reduction of public assistance debt as
                    set forth in this section shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the State for the retirement of the debt. This program shall not prevent the State from taking any and all other measures available by law.

                <p>
                    Upon the termination of a child support obligation due to the death of the obligor, the Department shall determine whether the obligor's estate contains sufficient assets to satisfy any child support arrearages. If sufficient assets are available, the
                    Department shall attempt to collect the arrearage.

                        This section provides that an action to compel reimbursement of debt created must be commenced within "five years subsequent to the receipt of the last grant of public assistance." An action to collect a public assistance debt, if timely filed, may claim
                        all public assistance granted subsequent to June 30, 1975, provided there is no five year gap in payments. State ex rel. Terry v. Marrow, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 321 S.E.2d 575 (1984).

                    <p>
                        The only limitations in this section on the extent of reimbursement for which judgment may be obtained relate to the defendant's financial ability to furnish support during the relevant period of time. State ex rel. Terry v. Marrow,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 321 S.E.2d 575 (1984).

                    <p>
                        The trial court erred in ruling that the State was not entitled to recover from defendant for benefits paid for the benefit of his minor illegitimate son before he had any knowledge of the birth of his son and before demand was made upon him to support
                        the child. State ex rel. Terry v. Marrow, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 170, 321 S.E.2d 575 (1984).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Intervention in Support Action Brought by State. - The language of G.S. 110-137 operates to assign to the state or county only the right to reimbursement for those amounts of support money provided through AFDC. Thus grandmother who had cared for child
                        since her birth and had applied for assistance from the AFDC program retained her interest in defendant father's support obligation, and was entitled to intervene in an action for child support brought against defendant by the
                        State. State ex rel. Pender County Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Crews v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 354</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 501 (1987).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Discretion of Court. - The trial court was not required to grant the Department of Social Services' motion to establish arrearages just because it moved to establish arrearages within the applicable statute of limitations; the trial court was vested with
                        discretion to consider the equity of granting the motion to pursue the defendant-father for arrearages. Moore County v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 543 S.E.2d 529, cert. denied,
                        <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 728</cite>, 550 S.E.2d 780 (2001).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court's expressed concerns over the fact that the mother had named multiple persons as the minor child's father and had waited over 15 years before instituting suit against the father was sufficient to support its denial of a request for reimbursement
                        of past paid public assistance; in light of the trial court's ability to consider equitable factors in determining whether to order reimbursement, and the highly deferential standard on review, the denial was not wholly unsupported
                        by reason, nor otherwise a manifest abuse of discretion. State ex rel. Gillikin v. McGuire, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 620 S.E.2d 899 (2005).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        No Privity Between State and County Program. - Where the State brings an action seeking to establish paternity and recover public assistance paid on behalf of a State-administered child support enforcement program, the State is not in privity with a county-administered
                        child support enforcement program. State ex rel. Tucker v. Frinzi, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 411</cite>, 474 S.E.2d 127 (1996).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In respective actions where county DSS and the State sought to prove that defendant was the father of child and to recover past public assistance paid, the State had no control over the first action, and the interest of the State was not represented in
                        the first action; thus, the State was not in privity with county DSS and the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar the State's action. State ex rel. Tucker v. Frinzi, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 411</cite>,

                        Garnishment at Higher Rate Than Set in Underlying Support Order Prohibited. - Where, in 1985, court reduced future child support obligations of non-custodial parent (defendant) to $5.00 per week and set rate for payment on arrearages at $10.00 per week,
                        and in 1987, Child Support Enforcement Agency served defendant with notice of garnishment stating that defendant's wages would be garnished at rate of $60.00 per week, due process required that plaintiff could only garnish automatically
                        at rate set out in controlling support order; once underlying order set out amount of ongoing obligation and amount to be applied toward liquidation of overdue support plaintiff could not garnish at higher rate without first applying
                        by motion for modification in rate at which defendant was to pay arrearage; therefore, defendant was entitled to reimbursement of $100.00 for two weeks he was garnished above $10.00 per week allowed in court's 1985 order. Sampson

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 1999-293, s. 16, effective October 1, 1999, had provided: "Section 16. G.S. 110-36.3 is amended by adding a new subsection to read:" and set out a new subsection (d1). There is no G.S. 110-36.3, and G.S. 110-26
                    to 110-38 were repealed in 1969. It appears likely that the intent of the act was to add a subsection (d1) to G.S. 110-136.3. Subsequently, Session Laws 2000-140, s. 20 (a) repealed Session Laws 1999-293, s. 16, and Session Laws 2000-140,
                    s. 20(b) added a subsection (d1) to G.S. 110-136.3. Session Laws 2001-237, s. 5 recodified (d1) of G.S. 110-136.3 as subsection (c1) of G.S. 110-139.

                        In view of the purposes of this section, there is no distinction between a parent who owes both arrearages and current support payments and one whose total support obligation consists of arrearages. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite>                        65, 404 S.E.2d 478 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Applicability to Non-IV-D Cases. - The statutory provisions for mandatory income withholding in IV-D cases apply with equal force to orders for current support and to orders directing payment of arrearage. McGee v. McGee,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 19, 453 S.E.2d 531 (1995).

                    <p>
                        Subdivision (b)(2)c specifically provides that the withholding provisions apply when the court determines that the obligor is or has been delinquent. This language reveals that the legislature intended income withholding to apply in any case where the
                        obligor has ever fallen behind a month or more in payments. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 404 S.E.2d 478 (1991).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The General Assembly amended the income withholding statute in response to the requirements of the 1984 Amendments to the Social Security Act. The legislative history of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984 suggests that the purpose of the
                        amendments was to assure that all children in the United States who are in need of assistance in securing financial support from their parents will receive assistance regardless of their circumstances. Griffin v. Griffin,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 65, 404 S.E.2d 478 (1991).

                        Income Withholding Mandatory. - When services were being provided by a child support enforcement agency established under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, it was error for the trial court not to order wage withholding from a father who had been
                        ordered to pay child support. In IV-D cases, G.S. 110-136.3 and G.S. 110-136.4(b) required wage withholding. Guilford County v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 629 S.E.2d 178 (2006).

                        Notice Provisions Are Not Contrary to Federal Statute. - The notice provisions of this section which are the basis for wage garnishment proceedings are not contrary to federal statute which mandates advance notice of garnishment to non-custodial parents;
                        the State is exempt from federal advance notice requirements so long as North Carolina's scheme complies with state due process requirements. Sampson County Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Bolton v. Bolton,

                        Order to Remain Employed - Where the trial court acceded to an obligor father's request to withhold his child support obligation from his income, the trial court was within its prerogative to order the father to remain gainfully employed to ensure payment
                        of his child support obligation, absent proof that the father had any other income from which his obligation could be met. Miller v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 568 S.E.2d 914

        Constitutionality.
       </b> - The requirement that an Aid to Families with Dependent Children applicant must assign the support payments to the State, which then, in effect, remits the amount collected to the custodial parent as part of the AFDC
                        payment to be used for the benefit of the entire family, does not modify the child's interest in the use of the money so dramatically that it constitutes a taking of the child's property. Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 107 S.
                        Ct. 3008, 97 L. Ed. 2d 485 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Limitation of Assignment to Amount of Assistance Paid. - There is no conflict between the federal guidelines and the provision of this section which limits the assignment to the amount of public assistance paid. State ex rel. Pender County Child Support
                        Enforcement Agency ex rel. Crews v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 354</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 501 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Intervention in Support Action Brought by State. - The language of this section operates to assign to the state or county only the right to reimbursement for those amounts of support money provided through AFDC. Thus grandmother who had cared for child
                        since her birth and had applied for assistance from the AFDC program retained her interest in defendant father's support obligation, and was entitled to intervene in an action for child support brought against defendant by the
                        State. State ex rel. Pender County Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Crews v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 354</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 501 (1987).

                    <p>
                        Intervention in Parent's Support Case. - Child support enforcement agencies have an unconditional statutory right of intervention where a person has accepted public assistance on behalf of a dependent child, where that person applies for and pays a fee
                        for child support collection services, or where that person with an order under which the person is entitled to collect spousal support is also receiving child support enforcement services for a child support obligation. Therefore,
                        a child support enforcement agency had an unconditional statutory right to intervene in an ongoing support dispute pending between two parents because a mother had contracted for child support services, and the motion was timely
                        where it was filed one month after services were sought. Robbins v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 475, 784 S.E.2d 219 (2016).

                    <p>
                        Assignee of Right to Child Support Payments May Contest Elimination of Arrearages. - This section clearly provides for assignment of the right to child support payments to the State or county to the extent that they provide support money, and the fact
                        that arrearages accumulated before Social Services rendered aid is of no legal significance; thus, Social Services, as assignee of the right to child support payments, has standing to contest the elimination of arrearages. Tate

                    <p>
                        Because mother received Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits, she partially assigned her right "to any child support owed for the child" to Department of Social Services (DSS). Accordingly, DSS' status as assignee gave it a direct interest
                        in the termination proceeding which will be forever impaired absent its ability to intervene under N. C. R. Civ .P. 24(a)(2). Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 466 S.E.2d 322

                        Past Public Assistance Debt Owed by Indian. - The exercise of state court jurisdiction over paternity actions, where the mother, the child, and the putative father are all Indians living on the reservation, unduly infringes on tribal self-governance.
                        However, once paternity is established, the state courts have subject matter jurisdiction over causes of action brought by the State pursuant to requirements of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program to collect a debt
                        owed to the State for past public assistance and to obtain a judgment for future child support. Jackson County ex rel. Child Support Enforcement Agency ex rel. Jackson v. Swayney, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 52</cite>,

                    <p>
                        No Privity Between State and County Support Program. - Where the State brings an action seeking to establish paternity and recover public assistance paid on behalf of a State-administered child support enforcement program, the State is not in privity
                        with a county-administered child support enforcement program. State ex rel. Tucker v. Frinzi, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 411</cite>, 474 S.E.2d 127 (1996).

                    <p>
                        In respective actions where county DSS and the State sought to prove that defendant was the father of child and to recover past public assistance paid, the State had no control over the first action, and the interest of the State was not represented in
                        the first action; thus, the state was not in privity with county DSS and the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel did not bar the State's action. State ex rel. Tucker v. Frinzi, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 411</cite>,

                        County has the authority and the duty to pursue an action against the responsible parent for the maintenance of the child and recovery of amounts paid by the county for support of the child. The county may bring the action in the name of the mother or
                        in its own name. She is in either case required to cooperate with the county in the trial of the action. Settle ex rel. Sullivan v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 616</cite>, 308 S.E.2d 288 (1983).

                    Any party to whom child support has been ordered to be paid, and who has failed to receive the ordered support payments for two consecutive months, may make application to a magistrate for issuance of criminal process against the responsible parent for
                    violation of G.S. 14-322. If the magistrate determines that the applicant has failed to receive the ordered support for two consecutive months, and that the responsible parent has willfully neglected or refused to make such payments,
                    he shall make a finding of probable cause and issue criminal process for violation of G.S. 14-322. It shall be the duty of the District Attorney to prosecute such charges according to law. It shall be the duty of the Clerk of Superior
                    Court to assist the applicant in making such application to the magistrate for the issuance of criminal process, and to supply such necessary child support records as are in his possession to the magistrate, District Attorney, and
                    the Court.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 1999-293, s. 16, effective October 1, 1999, had provided: "Section 16. G.S. 110-36.3 is amended by adding a new subsection to read:" and set out a new subsection (d1). There is no G.S. 110-36.3, and G.S. 110-26
                    to 110-38 were repealed in 1969. It appears likely that the intent of the act was to add a subsection (d1) to G.S. 110-136.3. Subsequently, Session Laws 2000-140, s. 20 (a) repealed Session Laws 1999-293, s. 16, and Session Laws 2000-140,
                    s. 20(b) added a subsection (d1) to G.S. 110-136.3. Session Laws 2001-237, s. 5 recodified (d1) of G.S. 110-136.3 as subsection (c1) of G.S. 110-139.

                <p>
                    Subsection (c1) was formerly codified as G.S. 110-136.3(d1). It was recodified as subsection (c1) of this section by Session Laws 2001-237, s. 5, effective June 23, 2001.

                    to be served upon the obligor, and when the matched account is owned jointly, any other nonliable owner of the account, and the financial institution a notice as provided by this subsection. The notice shall include the name of the
                    obligor, the financial institution where the account is located, the account number of the account to be levied to satisfy the lien, the certified amount of unpaid support, information for the obligor or account owner on how to remove
                    the lien or contest the lien in order to avoid the levy, and a reference to the applicable law, G.S. 110-139.2. The notice shall be served on the obligor, and any nonliable account owner, in any manner provided in Rule 4 of the North
                    Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. The financial institution shall be served notice in accordance with Rule 5 of the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon service of the notice, the financial institution shall proceed in the
                    following manner:
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order for an obligor or account owner to contest the lien, within 10 days after the obligor or account owner is served with the notice, the obligor or account owner shall send written notice of the basis of the contest to the Child Support Agency and
                    shall request a hearing before the district court in the county where the support order was entered. The obligor account holder may contest the lien only on the basis that the amount owed is an amount less than the amount of support
                    owed for six months, or is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000), whichever is less, or the contesting party is not the person subject to the court order of support. The district court may assess court costs against the nonprevailing
                    party. If no response is received from the obligor or account owner within 10 days of the service of the notice, the Child Support Agency shall notify the financial institution to submit payment, up to the total amount of the child
                    support arrears, if available. This amount is to be applied to the debt of the obligor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A financial institution shall not be liable to any person for complying in good faith with this subsection. The remedy set forth in this section shall be in addition to all other remedies available to the State for the reduction of the obligor's child
                    support arrears. This remedy shall not prevent the State from taking any and all other concurrent measures available by law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This levy procedure is to be available for direct use by all states' child support programs to financial institutions in this State without involvement of the Department.

                    a process requiring child care subsidy recipients to participate in child support services programs. To that end, DCDEE and DSS shall develop a plan requiring a custodial parent or other relative or person with primary custody of the
                    child who is receiving child care subsidy payments to cooperate with county child support services programs as a condition of receiving child care subsidy payments. In developing the plan, the DCDEE and DSS shall, at a minimum, consider

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) The access and exchange of information between county child support services programs/systems and child care subsidy services/systems and any differences that may create a conflict in coordinating child care subsidy payments with child support services.
