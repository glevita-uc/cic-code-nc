        Each local government and public authority shall operate under an annual balanced budget ordinance adopted and administered in accordance with this Article. A budget ordinance is balanced when the sum of estimated net revenues and appropriated fund balances is equal to appropriations. Appropriated fund balance in any fund shall not exceed the sum of cash and investments minus the sum of liabilities, encumbrances, and deferred revenues arising from cash receipts, as those figures stand at the close of the fiscal year next preceding the budget year. It is the intent of this Article that, except for moneys expended pursuant to a project ordinance or accounted for in an intragovernmental service fund or a trust and custodial fund excluded from the budget ordinance under G.S. 159-13(a), all moneys received and expended by a local government or public authority should be included in the budget ordinance. Therefore, notwithstanding any other provision of law, no local government or public authority may expend any moneys, regardless of their source (including moneys derived from bond proceeds, federal, state, or private grants or loans, or special assessments), except in accordance with a budget ordinance or project ordinance adopted under this Article or through an intragovernmental service fund or trust and custodial fund properly excluded from the budget ordinance.

        The budget ordinance of a unit of local government shall cover a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending June 30. The budget ordinance of a public authority shall cover a fiscal year beginning July 1 and ending June 30, except that the Local Government Commission, if it determines that a different fiscal year would facilitate the authority's financial operations, may enter an order permitting an authority to operate under a fiscal year other than from July 1 to June 30. If the Commission does permit an authority to operate under an altered fiscal year, the Commission's order shall also modify the budget calendar set forth in G.S. 159-10 through 159-13 so as to provide a new budget calendar for the altered fiscal year that will clearly enable the authority to comply with the intent of this Part.

The revenue-neutral property tax rate is the rate that is estimated to produce revenue for the next fiscal year equal to the revenue that would have been produced for the next fiscal year by the current tax rate if no reappraisal had occurred. To calculate the revenue-neutral tax rate, the budget officer shall first determine a rate that would produce revenues equal to those produced for the current fiscal year and then increase the rate by a growth factor equal to the average annual percentage increase in the tax base due to improvements since the last general reappraisal. This growth factor represents the expected percentage increase in the value of the tax base due to improvements during the next fiscal year. The budget officer shall further adjust the rate to account for any annexation, deannexation, merger, or similar event.

       <p>
        Detailed Accounts to Be Kept.
   
   - Under the provisions of the former County Fiscal Control Act, it was the duty of a county accountant to keep detailed accounts of appropriations and disbursements of county funds and to certify on each warrant or order drawn against the county that provision had been made for its payment and appropriation duly made or a bond or note duly authorized as required by the act. Avery County v. Braswell, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 270</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 864 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Certification of Vouchers.
   
   - The duties of a county accountant in certifying county vouchers under the former County Fiscal Control Act were special in character and were in addition to and not in substitution for the duties and functions of other county officers, and even if it were conceded that the signing of the voucher by the chairman of the county board was malfeasance, the accountant and his surety could not avoid liability on the ground that some other officer was guilty of negligence or malfeasance. Avery County v. Braswell, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 270</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 864 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment
   
   was inappropriate on plaintiffs' claim that defendant county failed to comply with its duties under the budget ordinance where it was unclear from the record whether the board continued to approve and appropriate in their budget ordinance each year the longevity pay plan originally proposed by the sheriff and adopted by the county in 1980. Hubbard v. County of Cumberland, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 544 S.E.2d 587, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 69</cite>, 553 S.E.2d 40 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission of Charges to Jury.
   
   - Where the evidence showed that expenditures contained both valid and invalid items, the court properly submitted the charges of approving an invalid claim and failure to preaudit to the jury. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).

       <p>
        County Not Entitled to Sovereign Immunity.
   
   - Defendant county has a statutory duty to provide the salaries to which it has committed itself in the enacted budget ordinance and may not, after having availed itself of the services provided by the law enforcement officers, claim sovereign immunity as a defense to its statutory and contractual commitment. Hubbard v. County of Cumberland, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 544 S.E.2d 587, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 69</cite>, 553 S.E.2d 40 (2001).

        Construed With G.S. 115C-441(a).
   
   - Transportation contractor's breach of contract suit against a county school board should have been dismissed because the contract was invalid and unenforceable since it lacked a preaudit certificate, which was required by G.S. 115C-441(a), and G.S. 115C-441(a) was identical to G.S. 159-28(a), which required such a preaudit certificate for contracts with local governments. Transp. Servs. of N.C. Inc. v. Wake County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 680 S.E.2d 223 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of Section.
   
   - This section sets forth the requirements and obligations that must be met before a county may incur contractual obligations. Cincinnati Thermal Spray, Inc. v. Pender County, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 399 S.E.2d 758 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        G.S. 159-28's provision requiring a county finance officer's pre-audit certificate that the county had unencumbered funds sufficient to pay the obligation agreed to in a contract did not, when a worker settled a workers' compensation claim against a county and no pre-audit certificate was attached to the settlement, place the worker on constructive notice that the agreement had to be approved by others, as no such certificate was required for an agreement to submit a formalized settlement agreement to the North Carolina Industrial Commission. Lee v. Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 598 S.E.2d 427, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 190</cite>, 607 S.E.2d 275 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the sequence of Workers' Comp. R. N.C. Indus. Comm'n art. X, R. 502(1) and N.C. Mediated Settlement &amp; Neutral Evaluation Conferences, N.C. Indus. Comm'n R. 4(d), in the settlement of a workers' compensation claim against a county, the pre-audit certificate certifying that a county has unencumbered funds with which to pay an obligation, will naturally be executed, if at all, after the settlement conference, when the amount of the county's liability is known, and as part of the general formalizing of the documents for submission to the North Carolina Industrial Commission, so an otherwise valid memorandum of agreement settling such a claim is not rendered void by the fact that it does not bear a pre-audit certificate, and an agreement to prepare a formalized settlement compromise agreement for the Industrial Commission's consideration does not require a pre-audit certificate to enable the Commission to direct the submission of a formalized compromise settlement agreement. Lee v. Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 598 S.E.2d 427, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 190</cite>, 607 S.E.2d 275 (2004).

        In a consolidated appeal in which a city sought review of a district court's denial of its motions to dismiss, because G.S. 159-28(a) did not apply to the police officers' and the firefighters' contracts, they did not need to allege the existence of preaudit certificates. Davis v. City of Greensboro, 770 F.3d 278 (4th Cir. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Show Existence of Certificate.
   
   - Where plaintiff made no showing that the certificate of compliance by the county board of commissioners required by subsection (a) of this section authorizing construction of water and sewer existed, no valid contract was formed as a result of alleged discussions between plaintiff and employee of county with regard to provision of adequate water and sewer systems for plaintiff's proposed facility. Cincinnati Thermal Spray, Inc. v. Pender County, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 399 S.E.2d 758 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the lease agreement entered between the plaintiff computer supplier and the defendant county failed to comply with the pre-audit certificate requirements of this section, the court held that no valid contract was formed between the plaintiff and defendant county and that the county, therefore, had not waived its sovereign immunity to be sued. Data Gen. Corp. v. County of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 545 S.E.2d 243 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Health board's dismissal of director for the omission a preaudit certificate on contracts was an error, as the board did not establish that the omission could produce disruption of work, a threat to persons or property, or any other serious effect that required immediate action. Steeves v. Scot. County Bd. of Health, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 567 S.E.2d 817, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 444</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 512 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment for a county was affirmed as a police officer could not obtain damages for breach of a memorandum requiring the county to pay her a special allowance since the memorandum did not include a preaudit certificate as required by G.S. 159-28(a). Finger v. Gaston County, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 631 S.E.2d 171 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's breach of contract claim failed to state a claim where: (1) plaintiff alleged that defendant breached a settlement reached in a mediation conference; (2) defendant alleged that there was no contact as there was no pre-audit statement required by G.S. 159-28(a); (3) plaintiff alleged an oral contract, but an oral contract could not contain the written certification required by G.S. 159-28(a); and (4) since plaintiff failed to allege a contract conforming to
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   159-28(a), she failed to allege a valid contract. Howard v. County of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 748 S.E.2d 1, review denied <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 238</cite>, 748 S.E.2d 321, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1000 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Because preaudit certificate was never signed by a finance officer as required by section,
   
   the settlement agreement did not meet the requirements of G.S. 159-28(a), and the trial court erred in granting company's motion to enforce the settlement agreement with the county. Cabarrus County v. Systel Bus. Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 423, 614 S.E.2d 596, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 61</cite>, 621 S.E.2d 177 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Later-Incurred Financial Obligation.
   
   - Where an obligation incurred by a town did not result in a financial obligation in the year in which the subject contract was signed, the lack of a pre-audit certificate did not invalidate the town's contract. Myers v. Town of Plymouth, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 522 S.E.2d 122 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unjust Enrichment Claim Failed.
   
   - As plaintiff did not make any allegations in his complaint establishing a valid contract with a town pursuant to the pre-audit certificate requirements of G.S. 159-28, the town did not waive its sovereign immunity; therefore, the trial court did not have jurisdiction over the town on plaintiff's claim for unjust enrichment.

        Each unit of local government and public authority shall have its accounts audited as soon as possible after the close of each fiscal year by a certified public accountant or by an accountant certified by the Commission as qualified to audit local government accounts. When specified by the secretary, the audit shall evaluate the performance of a unit of local government or public authority with regard to compliance with all applicable federal and State agency regulations. This audit, combined with the audit of financial accounts, shall be deemed to be the single audit described by the "Federal Single Audit Act of 1984". The auditor shall be selected by and shall report directly to the governing board. The audit contract or agreement shall (i) be in writing, (ii) include the entire entity in the scope of the audit, except that an audit for purposes other than the annual audit required by this section should include an accurate description of the scope of the audit, (iii) require that a typewritten or printed report on the audit be prepared as set forth herein, (iv) include all of its terms and conditions, and (v) be submitted to the secretary for his approval as to form, terms, conditions, and compliance with the rules of the Commission. As a minimum, the required report shall include the financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, all disclosures in the public interest required by law, and the auditor's opinion and comments relating to financial statements. The audit shall be performed in conformity with generally accepted auditing standards. The finance officer shall file a copy of the audit report with the secretary, and shall submit all bills or claims for audit fees and costs to the secretary for his approval. Before giving his approval the secretary shall determine that the audit and audit report substantially conform to the requirements of this section. It shall be unlawful for any unit of local government or public authority to pay or permit the payment of such bills or claims without this approval. Each officer and employee of the local government or local public authority having custody of public money or responsibility for keeping records of public financial or fiscal affairs shall produce all books and records requested by the auditor and shall divulge such information relating to fiscal affairs as he may request. If any member of a governing board or any other public officer or employee shall conceal, falsify, or refuse to deliver or divulge any books, records, or information, with an attempt thereby to mislead the auditor or impede or interfere with the audit, he is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.

       </li>
       <li id="t159sIIIa03s159-42ol1b">

The form of the project ordinance shall be in accordance with the relevant funding agency guidelines for that project. The estimated revenues plus fund balances available for a project shall be equal to or greater than the estimated expenditures. The estimated revenues and expenditures related to approved projects for a fiscal year may be included in the annual budget on an informational basis.

        Accounting Procedures. - A housing authority must comply with federal rules and regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development pertaining to procedures for the receipt, deposit, investment, transfer, and disbursement of money and other assets. The Commission may inquire into and investigate, with reasonable cause, the internal control procedures of a housing authority. The Commission may require any modifications in internal control procedures which, in the opinion of the Commission, are necessary or desirable to prevent embezzlement, mishandling of funds, or continued operating deficits.
       </li>
       <li id="t159sIIIa03s159-42ol1g">
        Audits. - The accounting system of a housing authority shall be so designed that the true financial condition of the housing authority can be determined at any time.

        Official Depository. - Housing authorities shall comply with G.S. 159-31, except in those circumstances where the statute is in conflict with U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development guidance, which shall control.
       </li>
       <li id="t159sIIIa03s159-42ol1k">
        Deposits and Payments. - Housing authorities shall comply with G.S. 159-32, 159-32.1, and 159-33.

        Provisions Governing General Obligation Bond Must Be Followed.
   
   - When an ordinance regulating a public enterprise is adopted by a local government to finance the public enterprise, the procedures supplied in the General Statutes for adopting such an ordinance must likewise be followed; when a general obligation bond is issued by a local government, the provisions of this Chapter must be followed; and when a local government purchases equipment, the applicable statutes regarding competitive bidding, where applicable, must likewise be followed. There is no statute or law that mandates notice and hearing requirements for ordinances requiring mandatory connections and fixing related connection charges and user fees. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

        Applicability.
   
   - A fair reading of the language of this section and G.S. 159-54 indicates that this Act applies to general obligation bonds which pledge the faith and credit of the county. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

        Authorization of Tax Distinguished from Approval of Order Imposing Tax.
   
   - Where the ballot that the voters considered indicated that the voters were asked only to authorize a tax rather than to approve an order imposing a tax, the County Commissioners were not compelled to impose a tax and were free, under these facts, to charge reasonable fees and charges to repay the bonds in lieu of the levy of a tax.

       "(a) Additional method.

       "(e) Severability. If any provision of this act or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of the act which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this act are severable."

       An amendment to this section, which would have added a new subdivision (b)(26) regarding undertaking public activities in or for the benefit of a development financing district, by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 3, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, never took effect.

The General Assembly finds and declares that there exists in counties in the State a serious shortage of decent, safe, and sanitary residential housing available at low prices or rentals to persons and families of low and moderate income. This shortage is inimical to the health, safety, welfare, and prosperity of all residents of the State and to the sound growth of North Carolina communities."

          Some of the cases cited below were decided under former statutory provisions similar to this section.

        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutionality of Former G.S. 153-77.
   
   - Former G.S. 153-77, specifying the purposes for which county bonds could be issued, was constitutional. Evans v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 560</cite>, 172 S.E. 323 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction of County Water and Sewer Systems.
   
   - The General Assembly may grant to a county the authority to issue bonds for the construction of water and sewer systems when "approved by a majority of those who shall vote thereon in any election held for such purpose," as required by N.C. Const., Art. V,
   <span class="s1">

   4(2). Ramsey v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 647</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 55 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Erection and Maintenance of Municipal Public Hospital.
   
   - The authority to issue valid bonds for the erection and maintenance of a public hospital with the approval of its voters was conferred on a municipality by former G.S. 160-230 and G.S. 160-378, and where other relevant statutes had been duly followed, the bonds so issued were a valid obligation of the town issuing them, and their issuance would not be enjoined by the courts. Burleson v. Board of Aldermen, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 30</cite>, 156 S.E. 241 (1930).

       <p>
        Lease of Property for Professional Baseball Stadium.
   
   - Trial court properly denied the taxpayers' motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted the county and the team's motions for judgment on the pleadings because the lease of property acquired under the Landbanking Statute, G.S. 159-48(c)(4b), for a professional baseball stadium was permitted as a county corporate purpose. Recreational facilities did not lose their public purpose merely because a private party was involved. Reese v. Mecklenburg County, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 491, 685 S.E.2d 34 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 242</cite>, 698 S.E.2d 653, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 445 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Erection of Schoolhouses and Purchase of Land for School Purposes by Counties.
   
   - The counties of the State are authorized to issue bonds and notes for the erection of schoolhouses and for the purchase of land necessary for school purposes, and to levy taxes for the payment of principal and interest on the same, not as municipal corporations, organized primarily for purposes of local government, but as administrative agencies of the State, employed by the General Assembly to discharge the duty imposed upon it by the Constitution to provide a state system of public schools. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927); Bridges v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 472</cite>, 20 S.E.2d 825 (1942).

        Indebtedness for teachers' salaries
   
   was held to come within the purview of an earlier statute authorizing issuance of bonds for the funding or refunding of valid indebtedness. Hampton v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 213</cite>, 141 S.E. 744 (1928).

        Validity of Refunding Bonds.
   
   - Where a county under power conferred by special statute has borrowed money from time to time for the maintenance and equipment of its public schools, its bonds to refund the indebtedness so incurred are valid if issued in conformity with the provisions of the applicable statute. Hartsfield v. Craven County, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 358</cite>, 139 S.E. 698 (1927).

      <p>
       When a unit of local government proposes to issue bonds that must be approved by a vote of the people, it shall first publish a notice of its intent to make application to the Commission for approval of the issue. The notice shall be published once not less than 10 days before the application is filed. The notice shall state (i) that the board intends to file an application with the Commission for approval of a bond issue, (ii) in brief and general terms the purpose of the proposed issue, (iii) the maximum amount of bonds to be issued, and (iv) that any citizen or taxpayer of the issuing unit may, within seven days after the date of the publication, file with the governing board and the Commission a statement of any objections he may have to the issue. The Commission may prescribe the form of the notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any citizen or taxpayer of the issuing unit who objects to the proposed bond issue in whole or in part may, within seven days from the date of publication of the notice, file a written statement of his objections with the board and the Commission. The statement shall set forth each objection to the proposed bond issue and shall contain the name and address of the person filing it. The Commission shall consider the statement of objections along with the application and shall notify the objector and the board of its disposition of each objection.

      </h3>
      <p>
       No bonds may be issued under this Article unless the issue is approved by the Local Government Commission. The governing board of the issuing unit shall file an application for Commission approval of the issue with the secretary of the Commission. If the issuing unit is a regional public transportation authority, the application must be accompanied by resolutions of the special tax board of that authority and of each of the boards of county commissioners of the counties organizing the authority approving of the application. The application shall state such facts and have attached to it such documents concerning the proposed bonds and the financial condition of the issuing unit as the secretary may require. The Commission may prescribe the form of the application.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before he accepts the application, the secretary may require the governing board or its representatives to attend a preliminary conference to consider the proposed bond issue. If the issuing unit is a merged school administrative unit described in G.S. 115C-513, each county in which the merged unit is located may attend the preliminary conference.
      </p>
      <p>
       After an application in proper form has been filed, and after a preliminary conference if one is required, the secretary shall notify the unit in writing that the application has been filed and accepted for submission to the Commission. The secretary's statement shall be conclusive evidence that the unit has complied with this section.

          That the proposed bond issue is necessary or expedient.

         <li id="t159sIVa04s159-52ol1b2">
          That the amount proposed is adequate and not excessive for the proposed purpose of the issue.

         <li id="t159sIVa04s159-52ol1b4">

       If the Commission tentatively decides to deny the application because it is of the opinion that any one or more of these conclusions cannot be supported from the information presented to it, it shall so notify the unit filing the application. If the unit so requests, the Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application at which time any interested persons shall be heard. The Commission may appoint a hearing officer to conduct the hearing, and to present a summary of the testimony and his recommendations for the Commission's consideration.

       <li id="t159sIVa04s159-54ol11">
        Briefly and generally and without specification of location or material of construction, the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued, but not more than one purpose may be stated.

          Many of the cases cited below were decided under former statutory provisions similar to this section.
         </b>
        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicability.
   
   - A fair reading of the language of this section and G.S. 159-54 indicates that this Act applies to general obligation bonds which pledge the faith and credit of the county. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The bond order is the crucial foundation document which supports and explains the proposal
   
   to be submitted, and material representations set out in the bond order ordinarily become essential elements of the proposition submitted to the voters. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts are without authority to supply a deficiency in the bond order.
   
   Hall v. Commissioners of Duplin, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 367</cite>, 142 S.E. 315 (1928).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Stipulation in Bond Order as Limitation on Subsequent Official Acts.
   
   - Where bond order contains a stipulation definitely fixing the maximum amount of county funds to be expended on a proposed project, such stipulation, treated as a compact, becomes a limitation upon subsequent official acts based on a favorable vote and may not be materially varied. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision Becoming Part of Bonds.
   
   - A provision set out in former G.S. 159-46 and incorporated in an ordinance authorizing the issuance of bonds entered into and became an integral part of the bonds when issued, with contractual force and effect, which could not be impaired by subsequent legislation. Nash v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 301</cite>, 190 S.E. 475 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinance authorizing a bond sale and calling a special election must state the purpose
   
   in only brief and general terms. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Proceeds of Bonds Limited by Bond Order.
   
   - Where a bond order approved by the voters of a county authorized the issuance of bonds in an aggregate amount to finance a new building or buildings to be used as a public hospital and the acquisition of a suitable site therefor, the use of the proceeds of the bonds was limited by the bond order, and the county could not use the surplus left after completing the project contemplated in the bond order toward the construction of a clinic in another municipality of the county. Lewis v. Beaufort County, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 628</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 77 (1959).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Substantial Deviation from Purpose Found.
   
   - Where the manifest purpose for which a civic center bond issue was proposed was to revitalize the downtown area, with the civic center becoming the catalyst for other projects, and the site finally chosen by the city council remained in the downtown area, although at a distance of approximately four blocks from the site noted in speeches by public officials before the election, there was not a substantial deviation from the purpose for which the bonds were proposed. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Misrepresentations made as to the site of the civic center for construction of which a bond issue to be paid by taxes was proposed did not vitiate the question as submitted to the voters in the bond issue election. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Funds for Hospital "Buildings".
   
   - Where the resolution of the county commissioners in submitting to a vote the question of issuing bonds for a public hospital used the word "buildings," and it was later found that a surplus would remain after the erection and equipment of the main hospital building, such surplus could be used for the purpose of erecting on the hospital grounds a home for nurses, technicians and others engaged in essential employment incidental to the proper operation of the hospital. Worley v. Johnston County, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 592</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 99 (1950).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent to Use Funds for Construction of Water and Sewer Lines in Annexed Areas.
   
   - Where there was no irregularity in the authorization of municipal bonds for its water and sewer systems, and in the city's notice of intent to annex certain areas it was stated that the city intended to use certain of the proceeds of the bonds for the construction of water and sewer lines in areas intended to be annexed, the fact that neither the bond ordinance nor the ballots used in the election at which the issuance of the bonds was approved disclosed such intent did not affect the validity of the bonds. Upchurch v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 676</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 772 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A bond order may contain several sections
   
   and authorize the issue of bonds for different purposes. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 484 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bond order need not set out in detail estimates of cost and descriptions
   
   of the particular projects for which the funds are proposed to be used, and their inclusion does not limit the allocation of the proceeds of the bonds, provided the use of the funds falls within the general purpose designated. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 484 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Specify That Public Funds Will Supplement Bond Moneys.
   
   - Where public funds are to supplement bond moneys, it is not required that the bond order specify, or the voters be advised, that the proceeds of the proposed bond issue are to be used with, or in addition to, a sum of money on hand or otherwise available for the proposed improvement. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But Where Order Stipulates Total Sum to Be Expended, Appropriation of Additional Sum Is Unauthorized.
   
   - While a county may ordinarily expend unallocated nontax moneys for the public purpose of a county hospital even in those instances in which a bond order for the hospital does not specify that the proceeds of the bonds are to be used together with such unallocated nontax moneys, where the bond order specifically specified that the total maximum amount to be expended by the county for the hospital was not to exceed $465,000, the allocation of an additional supplemental appropriation of over $138,000 out of nontax moneys on hand was a material variance from the compact as set forth in the bond order, and the county could be restrained in a proper suit from issuing the bonds and disbursing county funds in accordance with hospital plans predicated upon such increased appropriation. Rider v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 620</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 913 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Amount and Manner of Assessment Against Each Abutting Owner Need Not Be Set Forth.
   
   - It is not required that a bond ordinance of a municipality set forth in express terms the proportion of the cost of the proposed improvements which has been, or is to be, assessed against the property of each owner abutting upon the streets to be improved, or the terms and method of making the payment, if the procedure follow the direction of the statutes relating to the subject. Leak v. Town of Wadesboro, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 683</cite>, 121 S.E. 12 (1923).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A tax must be levied only if revenue from other sources is inadequate to repay the principal and interest on the bonds outstanding.
   
   McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Repayment of Bonds by Charging Reasonable Fees.
   
   - Where the ballot that the voters considered indicated that the voters were asked only to authorize a tax rather than to approve an order imposing a tax, the County Commissioners were not compelled to impose a tax and were free, under these facts, to charge reasonable fees and charges to repay the bonds in lieu of the levy of a tax. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

       - An amendment to subsection (a) of this section by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 4, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to subsection (a) of this section, therefore, never took effect.

Such an amendment was proposed by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1247, was submitted to the people on Nov. 2, 1982, and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, did not go into effect.

        Action Attacking Bond Order on Ground of Failure to File Statement.
   
   - Where taxpayers instituted an action attacking a bond order passed by the board of county commissioners for failure of the commissioners to comply with the statute requiring the filing of a true statement of the county debt, the attack upon the order was upon statutory as distinguished from constitutional grounds, and an action instituted more than 30 days after the first publication of the order could not be maintained.

      </h3>
      <p>
       After the introduction of the bond order, the clerk shall publish it once with the following statement appended:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The foregoing order has been introduced and a sworn statement of debt has been filed under the Local Government Bond Act showing the appraised value of the [issuing unit] to be $ ____________ and the net debt thereof, including the proposed bonds, to be $ ____________. The finance officer of the [issuing unit] has filed a statement estimating that the total amount of interest that will be paid on the bonds over the expected term of the bonds, if issued, is $ ____________. The estimate is preliminary, is for general informational purposes only, and may differ from the actual interest paid on the bonds. A tax will [may] be levied to pay the principal of and interest on the bonds if they are issued. Anyone who wishes to be heard on the questions of the validity of the bond order and the advisability of issuing the bonds may appear at a public hearing or an adjournment thereof to be held at ______________.

      </p>
      <p>
       The publication may include a summary of the assumptions upon which the estimate of the total amount of interest that will be paid on the bonds over the expected term of the bonds, if issued, is based, and may further state that there is no assurance that the circumstances included in the assumptions will occur, that the occurrence of certain of the assumptions is beyond the control of the issuing unit, and that differences between the actual circumstances at the time the bonds are issued from the assumptions included in the estimate could result in significant differences between the estimated interest and the actual interest on the bonds. The statement may include additional qualifications as the unit deems appropriate. The validity of bonds authorized to be issued pursuant to this act is not subject to challenge on the grounds that the actual interest cost of the bonds when issued is different than the amount set forth in the estimate referenced in the publication of the bond order as introduced.

        Sufficiency of Publication.
   
   - Former statute requiring notice to taxpayers, etc., of an opportunity to be heard before a county could issue bonds for various purposes was sufficiently complied with if several orders of the county commissioners were published in the same advertisement and a date and place, fixed for passing upon the objections made, if any, was separately placed in the publication, distinctly referring to each of the separate purposes.

       <p>
        Right to Test Constitutionality of Bond Issue Not Affected.
   
   - Former G.S. 153-90, similar to this section, did not prevent a suit to determine the constitutionality of the bond issue. Sessions v. Columbus County, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 634</cite>, 200 S.E. 418 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the proposed bond issue contravened the Constitution, the requirement of former G.S. 153-90, similar to this section, that actions to restrain issuance of bonds by counties must be instituted within 30 days of the first publication of notice of the adoption of the bond resolution did not apply. Sessions v. Columbus County, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 634</cite>, 200 S.E. 418 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suit Alleging Violation of Statutory Restrictions on Amount of Bonds.
   
   - Where a board of county commissioners, under ordinance duly passed and hearing thereon had, was about to issue bonds for the necessary purpose of erecting a jail, etc., contrary to the restrictions of the former County Finance Act limiting the amount of bonds, a suit to restrain the issuance of the bonds was required to be commenced within 30 days after the publication of the required notice and order, and a suit instituted after the time prescribed could not be maintained. The question whether former statute, similar to this section, was strictly one of limitation or a condition annexed to the cause of action was immaterial. Kirby v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 440</cite>, 152 S.E. 165 (1930).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suit Based on Failure to File True Statement of County Debt.
   
   - Where taxpayers instituted an action attacking a bond order passed by the board of county commissioners on the ground that the commissioners had failed to comply with former G.S. 153-84, requiring the filing of a true statement of the county debt, the attack upon the order was held to be upon statutory as distinguished from constitutional grounds, and an action instituted more than 30 days after the first publication of the order could not be maintained. Garrell v. Columbus County, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 589</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 701 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suit Based on Irregularities in Bond Order and Ballot.
   
   - Action to enjoin issuance of hospital bonds and to restrain disbursement of county funds therefor on the ground of irregularities in the bond order and form of ballot was held precluded by former statutes similar to this section and G.S. 159-62 because not instituted until after 30 days subsequent to the statement of the result of election.

       <p>
        Validity of Bond Order in Absence of Petition for Referendum.
   
   - Where no petition was filed within the time prescribed, praying that a bond order duly passed by the board of commissioners of a county be submitted to the voters of the county, in accordance with the provisions of the former County Finance Act, the bond order was valid and effective, without the approval of the voters of the county.

       <p>
        Approval of Voters Required Where Petition Filed.
   
   - Where a petition was filed in accordance with statutory provisions, praying that a bond order duly passed by the board of commissioners of a county, authorizing and directing the issuance of bonds of the county for the purpose of procuring money for the purchase, construction, improvement or equipment of schoolhouses required for the maintenance of a school in each of the districts of the county as required by the Constitution of the State, be submitted to the voters of the county, such bond order was not valid or effective until the same had been approved by the voters of the county as provided.

   - Where the taxpayers of a county filed suit under this section to restrain the issuance of bonds until authorized by the qualified voters of the county, and there was a controversy as to whether the signatures of the requisite 15% (now 10%) of qualified voters had been obtained to the petition, a temporary restraining order would be continued until the sufficiency of the petition could be determined.

        </span>
       </p>
       <p>
        Validity of Elections Favored.
   
   - It is the general rule that every reasonable presumption will be indulged in favor of the validity of elections, and the courts will uphold the validity of municipal bond elections unless clear grounds are shown for invalidating them. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The result of an election as determined by the proper election officials shall stand until it shall be regularly contested
   
   and reversed by a tribunal having jurisdiction for that purpose. The court will not permit itself to be substituted for the proper election officials in the first instance for the purpose of canvassing the returns from the officers holding the election and declaring the result thereof. Garner v. Town of Newport, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 449</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 505 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinance authorizing a bond sale and calling a special election must state the purpose
   
   in only brief and general terms. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessity of Notice.
   
   - While, so far as the officers are concerned who are charged with the duty of giving notice, the requirement as to notice is imperative, yet it will be regarded, otherwise, as directory, if the result would not be changed by a departure from the provisions of the statute. The law looks more to the substance than to the form, and if it appears that a clear majority of the qualified voters have cast their votes in favor of the proposition submitted to them, and that there has been a fair and full opportunity for all to vote, and that there has been no fraud, and the election is in all respects free from taint of any sort, so that no well founded suspicion can be cast upon it, it would be idle to say that this free and untrammeled expression of the popular will should be disregarded and set aside. Hill v. Skinner, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 405</cite>, 86 S.E. 351 (1915); Board of Comm'rs v. C.M. Malone &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 604</cite>, 103 S.E. 134 (1920).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Election Held.
   
   - The requirement of former G.S. 160-387, that a special bond election should not be held within one month before or after a regular municipal election, was mandatory, and the statutory period was to be computed by excluding the first and including the last day thereof as provided in G.S. 1-593. Adcock v. Town of Fuquay Springs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 423</cite>, 140 S.E. 24 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute permits the use of a broad and general ballot in bond elections.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission of More Than One Question or Proposal at Same Election.
   
   - While former G.S. 153-93 permitted the submission of more than one question or proposal in one and the same election, this contemplated questions authorized by law. Parker v. Anson County, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 78</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 338 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ballot Held to Comply with Statute.
   
   - A ballot for a school bond election which stated the question submitted for approval or disapproval, followed by a brief statement of the purposes for which the proceeds of the proposed bonds were to be used and that a tax would be levied to pay the principal and interest on the bonds in event of approval, followed by the word "Yes" and the word "No" and a square opposite each, with instructions as to how the ballot should be marked, was held to comply with former G.S. 153-96 and G.S. 163-150, and the fact that the number of proposed projects necessarily resulted in a ballot somewhat longer than usual was not objectionable. Parker v. Anson County, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 78</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 338 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Misrepresentations made as to the site of a civic center,

        § 159-64. Within what time bonds may be issued.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Bonds may be issued under a bond order at any time within seven years after the bond order takes effect. Such period may be extended prior to the expiration of such period from seven years to 10 years as hereinafter provided. The board of the issuing unit shall file an application for Commission approval of such extension with the secretary of the Commission. The application shall state such facts and have attached to it such documents concerning such extension as the secretary may require. The Commission may prescribe the form of such application. In determining whether to approve such extension, the Commission may inquire into and give consideration to any matters which it believes may relate to such extension.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Commission may enter an order approving a proposed extension of the maximum time period for issuing bonds under a bond order from seven to 10 years if, upon the basis of the information and evidence it receives, it finds and determines that governmental approvals relative to the purpose to be financed in whole or in part with the proceeds of the bonds cannot be obtained within seven years after the bond order has taken effect, that funds to be applied together with the proceeds of the bonds to finance the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued will not be available within seven years after the bond order has taken effect or that the proposed extension is necessary for other reasons that are not within the direct control of the issuing unit other than any order of any court. If the Commission enters an order denying such extension, then the proceedings under this section shall be at an end.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Commission enters an order approving a proposed extension of the maximum time period for issuing bonds under a bond order as provided in this section, then the board shall fix the time and place for a public hearing on such extension and the clerk shall publish such bond order once with the following statement appended:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The foregoing order took effect on ____________, ____________. Anyone who wishes to be heard on the question of whether the maximum time period for issuing bonds under such order should be extended from seven years to 10 years after such date may appear at a public hearing or an adjournment
       thereof to be held at _______________________________________________________
       (time)
       on ____________ at ____________
       (date)
   (place)
       ________________________________
       Clerk"
       On the date fixed for such hearing, which shall be not earlier than six days after the date of publication of the bond order with appended statement as provided in this section, the board shall hear anyone who might wish to be heard on the question of whether the maximum time period for issuing bonds under the bond order should be extended from seven years to 10 years. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time.
       After such hearing, the board may adopt an order providing that the maximum time period for issuing bonds under the bond order has been extended from seven to 10 years after the bond order has taken effect. Such order shall provide that it will take effect 30 days after its publication following adoption.
       After adoption, the clerk shall publish once an order extending the maximum time period for issuing bonds under a bond order with the following statement appended:
       "The foregoing order was adopted on the ________ day of ____________,
   ____________, and is hereby published this ________ day of ____________, ________. Any action or proceeding questioning the validity of such order must be begun within 30 days after the date of publication of this notice.
       ________________________________
       Clerk"
      </p>
      <p>
       Any action or proceeding in any court to set aside an order extending the maximum time period for issuing bonds under a bond order, or to obtain any other relief, upon the ground that such order is invalid, must be begun within 30 days after the date of publication of such order as adopted. After the expiration of this period of limitation, no right of action or defense based upon the invalidity of such order shall be asserted nor shall the validity of such order be open to question in any court upon any ground whatever, except in an action or proceeding begun within the period of limitation prescribed in this section.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the issuance of bonds under any bond order is prevented or prohibited by any order of any court, the period of time within which bonds may be issued under the bond order in litigation shall be extended by the length of time elapsing between the date of institution of the action or proceeding and the date of its final disposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the issuance of bonds under any bond order, to finance public improvements in an area to be annexed, is prevented or prohibited by reason of litigation respecting the annexation and the Local Government Commission shall certify to such effect, the period of time within which bonds may be issued under the bond order shall be extended by the length of time elapsing between the date of institution of the litigation and the date of its final disposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Assembly may at any time prior to the expiration of the maximum time period herein provided extend the time for issuing bonds under bond orders.
      </p>

       When any such extension is effected or granted pursuant to this section, no further approval of the voters shall be required.

        § 159-72. Purposes for which funding and refunding bonds may be issued; when such bonds may be issued.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       A unit of local government may issue funding and refunding bonds under this Article for the purposes listed in G.S. 159-48(a)(4), (5), (6), or (7). Funding bonds may be issued if the debt, judgment, or other obligation to be paid is payable at the time of the passage of the bond order or within one year thereafter. Refunding bonds may be issued at any time prior to the final maturity of the debt or obligation to be refunded. The proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows: either (i) to the immediate payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded or (ii) if not required for the immediate payment of the obligations being refunded such proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded, and to pay any expenses incurred in connection with such refunding, but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any amounts in excess of the amounts required for such purposes, including, without limitation, provision for the pledging of any such excess to the payment of the principal of and interest on any issue or series of refunding bonds issued pursuant to G.S. 159-78. Money in any such trust fund may be invested in (i) direct obligations of the United States government, or (ii) obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government, or (iii) to the extent then permitted by law in obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government, or (iv) in certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in the State of North Carolina if such certificates shall be secured by a pledge of any of said obligations described in (i), (ii), or (iii) above having an aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded but which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable or, if presently redeemable, shall not have been called for redemption.
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal amount of refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section, together with the principal amount of refunding bonds, if any, issued under G.S. 159-78 in conjunction with refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section, shall not exceed the amount set forth in G.S. 159-78.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except as expressly modified in this Part, funding and refunding bonds issued under the provisions of this Part shall be subject to the limitations and procedures set out in Parts 1 and 2 of this Article.

        Statute Limiting Tax Rate of Municipality Held Inoperative Under Facts.
   
   - Where defendant municipality proposed to issue refunding bonds to be exchanged for like amounts of the original bonds in the hands of the holders of the original indebtedness, the refunding bonds to be secured by all rights and powers of taxation which protected and formed a part of the obligation of the original bonds, it was held that the parties and the debt were the same and the transaction amounted in reality to an extension and renewal of the original bonds under legislative sanction, and an act of the legislature, passed after the issuance of the original bonds, limiting the tax rate of the municipality was inoperative as to the refunding bonds when the limitation therein imposed would prevent the payment of the refunding bonds according to their tenor; the contention that even though the refunding bonds would not create a new debt, such debt would be evidenced by a new contract, and that therefore the refunding bonds would be subject to the limitation of the statute enacted prior to the issuance of the refunding bonds was untenable.

        Constitutionality of Former Statutes.
   
   - Former versions of G.S. 159-52 to 159-56 were not unconstitutional either on the ground that they conferred nonjudicial functions on the superior courts or on the ground that they denied due process of law to taxpayers or citizens of a local governmental unit, in violation of the provisions of U.S. Const., Amend.

       <p>
        Proceeding in Rem.
   
   - The action authorized by former versions of G.S. 159-52 to 159-56 was in the nature of a proceeding in rem, and was adversary both in form and in substance. These sections contemplated that issues both of law and of fact could be raised by pleadings duly filed, and that such issues should be determined by the court. The court had no power by virtue of these sections to validate bonds which were for any reason invalid. It had power only to determine whether or not on the facts as found by the court and under the law applicable to such facts the bonds were valid. Castevens v. Stanly County, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 642</cite>, 191 S.E. 739 (1937).

        Service of Summons by Publication Sufficient.
   
   - The contention that an owner of taxable property within the unit, or a citizen residing therein, may be deprived of his property, without due process of law, or contrary to the law of the land, by a decree or judgment in the action declaring or adjudging that bonds and the tax to be levied for their payment, are valid, because it is not required that his name shall appear in the summons or in the complaint, or that the summons shall be served on him personally, cannot be sustained. The action is declared by statute to be in the nature of a proceeding in rem. In such case, all persons included within a well-defined class may be made parties defendant, and service of summons by publication is sufficient, although such persons are not named in the summons.

        Taxpayer Who Fails to Exercise Rights Without Grounds of Complaint.
   
   - No decree or judgment adverse to a taxpayer's rights can be rendered in an action instituted and prosecuted by a taxing unit to have a proposed funding bond issue declared valid until every taxpayer and citizen of the unit has been lawfully served with summons, and until he has had ample opportunity to appear and file such pleadings as he may wish. If he has failed to avail himself of his constitutional rights, which are fully protected by the statute, he has no just ground of complaint that the court will not hear him when he invokes its aid after the decree or judgment has been finally rendered, and others have relied upon its protection.

        § 159-78. Special obligation refunding bonds.
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       In conjunction with the issuance of refunding bonds pursuant to G.S. 159-72 or G.S. 159-84 a unit of local government may issue a series of refunding bonds which shall be payable from the excess of the amount required by a trust fund established pursuant to G.S. 159-72 or G.S. 159-84 to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being retired and the amount required to pay any expenses incurred in connection with such refunding to the extent such expenses are payable from said trust fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such refunding bonds shall be special obligations of the municipality issuing them. The principal of and interest on such refunding bonds shall not be payable from the general funds of the municipality, nor shall they constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien, or encumbrance upon any of its property or upon any of its income, receipts, or revenues, except the trust fund established pursuant to G.S. 159-72 or G.S. 159-84 from which such refunding bonds are payable. Neither the credit nor the taxing power of the municipality is pledged for the payment of the principal or interest of such refunding bonds, and no holder of such refunding bonds has the right to compel the exercise of the taxing power of the municipality or the forfeiture of any of its property in connection with any default thereon. Every such refunding bond shall recite in substance that the principal of and interest on the bond is payable solely from the trust fund established for its payment and that the municipality is not obligated to pay the principal or interest except from such trust fund.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any refunding bonds issued under this section shall be issued in compliance with the procedure set forth in Article 5 of this Chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
       The principal amount of any issue of refunding bonds issued pursuant to G.S. 159-72 or G.S. 159-84, together with the principal amount of refunding bonds, if any, issued pursuant to this section in conjunction with a series of bonds issued under G.S. 159-72 or G.S. 159-84, shall not exceed the sum of the following: (i) the principal amount of the obligations being refinanced, (ii) applicable redemption premiums thereon, (iii) unpaid interest on such obligations to the date of delivery or exchange of the refunding bonds, (iv) in the event the proceeds from the sale of the refunding bonds are to be deposited in trust as provided by G.S. 159-72 or G.S. 159-84, interest to accrue on such obligations being refinanced from the date of delivery of the refunding bonds to the first or any subsequent available redemption date or dates selected, in its discretion, by the governing body of the unit of local government, or to the date or dates of maturity, whichever shall be determined by the governing body of the unit of local government to be most advantageous or necessary and (v) expenses, including bond discount, deemed by the governing body to be necessary for the issuance of the refunding bonds.

        If the aggregate principal amount repayable by the issuing unit under a repayment agreement is in excess of the aggregate principal amount of bonds or notes secured by the related Credit Facility, whether as a result of the inclusion in the Credit Facility of a provision for the payment of interest for a limited period of time or the payment of a redemption premium or for any other reason, then the amount of unissued bonds or notes during the term of such repayment agreement shall not be less than the amount of such excess, unless the payment of such excess is otherwise provided for by agreement of the issuing unit subject to the approval of the Commission. In determining whether or not to grant such approval, the Commission shall consider, in addition to such other factors it may deem relevant, the ability of the issuing unit to pay such excess from other sources without incurring additional indebtedness secured by a pledge of the faith and credit of the issuing unit or levying additional taxes and the adequacy of such other sources to accomplish such purpose.

       Purpose of the Revenue Bond Act of 1938 was to permit municipalities to engage in nongovernmental activities
   
   of a public nature by pledging the revenue derived from such undertakings to the payment of bonds issued in connection therewith. Thus the act avoided pledging the credit of the municipality to the payment of a debt, for by such arrangements no debt was incurred within the meaning of the Constitution. Britt v.

     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 1987, c. 577, s. 1.2 added a new s. 3.1 to Session Laws 1985, c. 639, providing that s. 3 of that act, which added subdivision (3)m to this section, did not apply to Buncombe County or any municipality located within that county; however, Session Laws 1989, c. 374, s. 2, provided that Session Laws 1985, c. 639, s. 3.1, as added by Session Laws 1987, c. 577, s. 1.2, was repealed. Therefore subdivision 3(m) of this section now has statewide application; there is no longer an exception for Buncombe County and the municipalities therein.

       § 159-84. Authorization of revenue bonds.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The State and each municipality is hereby authorized to issue its revenue bonds in such principal amount as may be necessary to provide sufficient moneys for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, extension, betterment, improvement, or payment of the cost of one or more revenue bond projects, including engineering, inspection, legal and financial fees and costs, working capital, interest on the bonds or notes issued in anticipation thereof during construction and, if deemed advisable by the State or a municipality, as the case may be, for a period not exceeding two years after the estimated date of completion of construction, establishment of debt service reserves, and all other expenditures of the State or the municipality, as the case may be, incidental and necessary or convenient thereto.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to agreements with the holders of its revenue bonds, the State or each municipality, as the case may be, may issue further revenue bonds and refund outstanding revenue bonds whether or not they have matured. Revenue bonds may be issued partly for the purpose of refunding outstanding revenue bonds and partly for any other purpose under this Article. Revenue bonds issued to refund outstanding revenue bonds shall be issued under this Article and not Article 4 of this Chapter or any other law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Refunding bonds may be issued at any time prior to the final maturity of the debt or obligation to be refunded. The proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows: either, (i) to the immediate payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded or (ii) if not required for the immediate payment of the obligations being refunded such proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded, and to pay any expenses incurred in connection with such refunding, but provision may be made for the pledging and disposition of any amounts in excess of the amounts required for such purposes, including, without limitation, provision for the pledging of any such excess to the payment of the principal of and interest on any issue or series or [of] refunding bonds issued pursuant to G.S. 159-78. Money in any such trust fund may be invested in (i) direct obligations of the United States government, or (ii) obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government, or (iii) to the extent then permitted by law in obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government, (iv) certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in the State of North Carolina if such certificates shall be secured by a pledge of any of said obligations described in (i), (ii), or (iii) above having any aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded but which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable or, if presently redeemable, shall not have been called for redemption.
     </p>
     <p>
      The principal amount of refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section, together with the principal amount of refunding bonds, if any, issued under G.S. 159-78 in conjunction with refunding bonds issued pursuant to this section, shall not exceed the amount set forth in G.S. 159-78.

   - Session Laws 2000-81, ss. 1-8, effective July 5, 2000, authorizes the issuance of State revenue bonds, not to exceed $40,000,000, to finance improvements to the water and sewer system for the Community of Butner and Camp Butner reservation.
   Specifically, the bonds are for paying the costs of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, improvement, enlargement, betterment, and extension of the water supply and distribution system and sewage collection and disposal system and certain costs of issuance of the bonds.
   The bonds are to be issued in compliance with the State and Local Government Revenue Bond Act,
   pursuant to an order adopted by the Council of State under G.S. 159-88, and are to be sold by the Local Government Commission pursuant to the provisions of Article 7 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159.html" target="_blank">Chapter 159</a></cite>.
   The bonds are tax exempt, excepting estate, inheritance, or gift taxes, income taxes on the gain from transfer of securities, and franchise taxes.
   Section 7 of the act provides that the act is supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws. It, being necessary for the health and welfare of the people of the State, is to be liberally construed.
   Section 7(d) contains a severability clause.

       Invocation of Taxing Power Not Provided For.
   
   - Where defendant municipality, which owned and operated its own electric distributing system, proposed to issue bonds to obtain funds for the construction of a municipal hydroelectric generating plant to be operated separate and apart therefrom, and the resolution of the city authorizing the issuance of the bonds provided that they should be payable solely out of the revenues of the system, and the bonds themselves were to contain a like provision, such bonds were not a general indebtedness of the municipality and its taxing power could not be invoked to provide for their payment. Provision that the city, if it should voluntarily elect to take energy from its generating system for its own uses, should pay the cost of furnishing the energy so taken, which in no event should exceed a fair and reasonable charge therefor, did not indirectly provide for invocation of the taxing power for the payment of the bonds.

       Calculating Principal Amount. - For purposes of calculating the aggregate principal amount of bonds within the meaning of any constitutional or statutory limitation on the incurrence of debt, the aggregate principal amount of any capital appreciation bonds is the aggregate of the initial offering prices at which the bonds are offered for sale to the public, including private or negotiated sales, or sold to the initial purchaser of the bonds in a private placement, in either case without reduction to reflect underwriters' discount or placement agents' or other intermediaries' fees.

      - An Article 6 entitled "Economic Development Financing Act" was enacted by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 2, but was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. Such an amendment was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. This Article, therefore, never took effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      An earlier Article 6, "Tax Increment Financing Act" was enacted by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1276, s. 1, but was made effective on certification of approval of an amendment to the State Constitution authorizing the enactment of general laws dealing with transactions of the type contemplated by the act. Such an amendment was proposed by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1247, was submitted to the people on Nov. 2, 1982, and was defeated. The earlier Article 6, therefore, never took effect.

     <p>
      Session Laws 2003-403, s. 22, provides: "Liberal Construction. This act, being necessary for the prosperity and welfare of the State and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect these purposes."

     </h3>
     <p>
      A unit of local government may not issue project development financing debt instruments under this Article unless the issue is approved by the Local Government Commission. The governing body of the issuing unit shall file with the secretary of the Commission an application for Commission approval of the issue. At the time of application, the governing body shall publish a public notice of the application in a newspaper of general circulation in the unit of local government. The application shall include any statements of facts and documents concerning the proposed debt instruments, development financing district, and development financing plan, and the financial condition of the unit, required by the secretary. The Commission may prescribe the form of the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      Before accepting the application, the secretary may require the governing body or its representatives to attend a preliminary conference in order to discuss informally the proposed issue, district, and plan and the timing of the steps to be taken in issuing the debt instruments. The development financing plan need not be adopted by the governing body at the time it files the application with the secretary. However, before the Commission may enter its order approving the debt instruments, the governing body must adopt the plan and make the findings described in G.S. 159-105(b)(1) and (5).
     </p>
     <p>
      After an application in proper form and order has been filed, and after a preliminary conference if one is required, the secretary shall notify the unit in writing that the application has been filed and accepted for submission to the Commission. The secretary's statement is conclusive evidence that the unit has complied with this section.

       Base Valuation in the Development Financing District. - After the Local Government Commission has entered its order approving a unit of local government's application for project development financing debt instruments, the unit shall immediately notify the tax assessor of the county in which the development financing district is located of the existence of the development financing district. Upon receiving this notice, the tax assessor shall determine the base valuation of the district, which is the assessed value of all taxable property located in the district on the January 1 immediately preceding the effective date of the district. If the unit or an agency of the unit acquired property within the district within one year before the effective date of the district, the tax assessor shall presume, subject to rebuttal, that the property was acquired in contemplation of the district, and the tax assessor shall include the value of the property so acquired in determining the base valuation of the district. The unit may rebut this presumption by showing that the property was acquired primarily for a purpose other than to reduce the incremental tax base. After determining the base valuation of the development financing district, the tax assessor shall certify the valuation to: (i) the issuing unit; (ii) the county in which the district is located if the issuing unit is not the county; and (iii) any special district, as defined in G.S. 159-7, within which the development financing district is located.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-107ol1b">
       Adjustments to the Base Valuation. - During the lifetime of the development financing district, the base valuation shall be adjusted as follows:

        <li id="t159sIVa06s159-107ol1b1">
         If the unit amends its development financing plan, pursuant to G.S. 160A-515.1 or G.S. 158-7.3, to remove property from the development financing district, on the succeeding January 1, that property shall be removed from the district and the base valuation reduced accordingly.

         If the unit amends its development financing plan, pursuant to G.S. 160A-515.1 or G.S. 158-7.3, to expand the district, the new property shall be added to the district immediately. The base valuation of the district shall be increased by the assessed value of the taxable property situated in the added territory on the January 1 immediately preceding the effective date of the district.

       Revenue Increment Fund. - When a unit of local government has established a development financing district, and the project development financing debt instruments for that district have been approved by the Commission, the unit shall establish a separate fund to account for the proceeds paid to the unit from taxes levied on the incremental valuation of the district. The unit shall also place in this fund any moneys received pursuant to an agreement entered into under G.S. 159-108.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-107ol1d">
       Levy of Property Taxes Within the District. - Each year the development financing district is in existence, the tax assessor shall determine the current assessed value of taxable property located in the district. The assessor shall also compute the difference between this current value and the base valuation of the district. If the current value exceeds the base value, the difference is the incremental valuation of the district. In each year the district is in existence, the county, and if the district is within a city or a special district as defined by G.S. 159-7, the city or the special district shall levy taxes against property in the district in the same manner as taxes are levied against other property in the county, city, or special district. The proceeds from ad valorem taxes levied on property in the development financing district shall be distributed as follows:

        <li id="t159sIVa06s159-107ol1d1">
         In any year in which there is no incremental valuation of the district, all the proceeds of the taxes shall be retained by the county, city, or special district, as if there were no development financing district in existence.

         In any year in which there is an incremental valuation of the district, the amount of tax due from each taxpayer on property in the district shall be distributed as provided in this subdivision. The net proceeds of the following taxes shall be paid to the government levying the tax: (i) taxes separately stated and levied solely to service and repay debt secured by a pledge of the faith and credit of the unit; (ii) nonschool taxes levied pursuant to a vote of the people; (iii) taxes levied for a municipal or county service district; and (iv) taxes levied by a taxing unit in a development financing district established by a different taxing unit and for which there is no increment agreement between the two units. All remaining taxes on property in the district shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the base valuation for the district and the denominator of which is the current valuation for the district. The amount shown as the product of this multiplication shall, when paid by the taxpayer, be retained by the county, city, or special district, as if there were no development financing district in existence. The net proceeds of the remaining amount shall, when paid by the taxpayer, be turned over to the finance officer of each issuing unit, who shall place this amount in the special revenue increment fund required by subsection (c) of this section. As used in this section, "net proceeds" means gross proceeds less refunds, releases, and any collection fee paid by the levying government to the collecting government.

       Effect of Annexation on District Established by a County. - If a city annexes land in a development financing district established by a county pursuant to G.S. 158-7.3, the proceeds of all taxes levied by the city on property within the district shall be paid to the city unless the city enters into an agreement with the county pursuant to this subsection, and the annexed land in the county's district that subsequently becomes a part of the city does not count against the city's five-percent (5%) limit under G.S. 158-7.3 or G.S. 160A-515.1 unless the city and the county enter into an agreement pursuant to this section. The city and the county may enter into an increment agreement under which the city agrees that city taxes on part or all of the incremental valuation in the district shall be paid into the revenue increment fund for the district. An increment agreement may be entered into when the district is established or at any time after the district is established.

       Use of Moneys in the Revenue Increment Fund. - If the development financing district includes property conveyed or leased by the unit of local government to a private party in consideration of increased tax revenue expected to be generated by improvements constructed on the property pursuant to G.S. 158-7.1, an amount equal to the tax revenue taken into account in arriving at the consideration, less the increased tax revenue realized since the construction of the improvement, shall be transferred from the Revenue Increment Fund to the county, city, or special district as if there were no development financing district in existence. Any money in excess of this amount in the Fund may be used for any of the following purposes, without priority other than priorities imposed by the order authorizing the project development financing debt instruments:

      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-108ol1a">
       Authorization. - A unit of local government that issues project development financing debt instruments may enter into agreements with the owners of real property in the development financing district for which the instruments were issued under which the owners agree to a minimum value at which their property will be assessed for taxation. Such an agreement may extend for the life of the development financing district or for a shorter period agreed to by the parties. The agreement may vary the agreed-upon minimum assessed value from year to year.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-108ol1b">
       Filing and Recording Agreement. - The unit shall file a copy of any agreement entered into pursuant to this section with the tax assessor for the county in which the development financing district is located. In addition, the unit shall cause the agreement to be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of that county, and the register of deeds shall index the agreement in the grantor's index under the name of the property owner. Once the agreement has been recorded in the office of the register of deeds, as required by this subsection, it is binding, according to its terms and for its duration, on any subsequent owner of the property.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-108ol1c">
       Minimum Assessment of Property. - An agreement entered into pursuant to this section establishes a minimum assessment of the real property subject to the agreement. If the county tax assessor determines that the real property has a true value less than the minimum established by the agreement, the assessor shall nevertheless assess the property at the minimum set out in the agreement. If the assessor, however, determines that the real property has a true value greater than the minimum established by the agreement, the assessor shall assess the property at the true value.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-108ol1d">
       Effect of Reappraisal. - If an agreement entered into pursuant to this section continues in effect after a reappraisal of property conducted pursuant to G.S. 105-286, the minimum assessment established in the agreement shall be adjusted as provided in this subsection. After the issuing unit of local government has adopted its budget ordinance and levied taxes for the fiscal year that begins next after the effective date of the reappraisal, it shall certify to the county tax assessor the total rate of ad valorem taxes levied by the unit and applicable to the property subject to the agreement. It shall also certify to the assessor the total rate of ad valorem taxes levied by the unit and applicable to the property in the immediately preceding fiscal year. The assessor shall determine the total amount of ad valorem taxes levied by the unit on the property in the immediately preceding fiscal year, based on the tax rate certified by the issuing unit. The assessor shall then determine a value of the property that would provide the same total amount of ad valorem taxes based on the tax rate certified for the fiscal year beginning next after the effective date of the reappraisal. The value so determined is the new minimum assessment for the property subject to the agreement.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-108ol1e">
       Agreement Effective Regardless of Improvements. - An agreement entered into pursuant to this section remains in effect according to its terms regardless of whether the improvements anticipated in the development financing plan are completed or whether those improvements continue to exist during the duration of the agreement. However, if any part of the property subject to the agreement is acquired by a public agency, the agreement is automatically modified by removing the acquired property from the agreement and reducing the minimum assessment accordingly.

Except as provided in G.S. 159-111, the unit may pledge the following additional sources of funds to the payment of the debt instruments, and no other sources: the proceeds from the sale of property in the development financing district; net revenues from any public facilities, other than portions of public utility systems, in the development financing district financed with the proceeds of the project development financing debt instruments; and, subject to G.S. 159-47, net revenues from any other public facilities, other than portions of public utility systems, in the development financing district constructed or improved pursuant to the development financing plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as provided in G.S. 159-111, the principal and interest on project development financing debt instruments do not constitute a legal or equitable pledge, charge, lien, or encumbrance upon any of the unit's property or upon any of its income, receipts, or revenues, except as may be provided pursuant to this section. Except as provided in G.S. 159-107 and G.S. 159-111, neither the credit nor the taxing power of the unit is pledged for the payment of the principal or interest of project development financing debt instruments, and no holder of project development financing debt instruments has the right to compel the exercise of the taxing power by the unit or the forfeiture of any of its property in connection with any default on the instruments. Unless the unit's taxing power has been pledged pursuant to G.S. 159-111, every project development financing debt instrument shall contain recitals sufficient to show the limited nature of the security for the instrument's payment and that it is not secured by the full faith and credit of the unit.

       In order to provide additional security for debt instruments issued pursuant to this Article, the issuing unit of local government may pledge its faith and credit for the payment of the principal of and interest on the debt instruments. Before such a pledge may be given, the unit shall follow the procedures and meet the requirements for approval of general obligation bonds under Article 4 of this Chapter. The unit shall also follow the procedures and meet the requirements of this Article. If debt instruments are issued pursuant to this Article and are also secured by a pledge of the issuing unit's faith and credit, the debt instruments are subject to G.S. 159-112 rather than G.S. 159-65.

       In order to provide additional security for debt instruments issued pursuant to this Article, and in lieu of pledging its faith and credit for that purpose pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, a unit of local government may pledge or grant a security interest in any available sources of revenues of the unit, including special assessments against property within the development financing district made by the unit pursuant to Article 9 of Chapter 153A of the General Statutes or Article 10 of Chapter 160A of the General Statutes, as long as doing so does not constitute a pledge of the unit's taxing power. In addition, to the extent the generation of the revenues is within the power of the unit, the unit may enter into covenants to take action in order to generate the revenues, as long as the covenant does not constitute a pledge of the unit's taxing power. In addition, the unit may pledge, mortgage, or grant a security interest in all or a portion of the real and personal property being financed or improved with the proceeds of the project development financing debt instrument. Property subject to a mortgage, deed of trust, security interest, or similar lien pursuant to this subsection may be sold at foreclosure in any manner permitted by the instrument creating the encumbrance, without compliance with any other provision of law regarding the disposition of publicly owned property.

The lien is valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind against a unit without regard to whether the parties have notice of the lien.

     <p>
      In fixing the details of project development financing debt instruments, the governing body of the issuing unit of local government is subject to these restrictions and directions:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-112ol11">
       The maturity date shall not exceed the shorter of (i) the longest of the various maximum periods of usefulness for the projects to be financed with debt instrument proceeds, as prescribed by the Local Government Commission pursuant to G.S. 159-122, or (ii) the end of the thirtieth year after the effective date of the development financing district.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-112ol12">

      <li id="t159sIVa06s159-112ol13">
       Any debt instrument may be made payable on demand or tender for purchase as provided in G.S. 159-79, and any debt instrument may be made subject to redemption prior to maturity, with or without premium, on such notice, at such times, and with such redemption provisions as may be stated. Interest on the debt instruments shall cease when the instruments have been validly called for redemption and provision has been made for the payment of the principal of the instruments, any redemption, any premium, and the interest on the instruments accrued to the date of redemption.
      </li>

       The debt instruments may bear interest at such rates payable semiannually or otherwise, may be in such denominations, and may be payable in such kind of money and in such place or places within or without this State as the issuing unit may determine.

     <p>
      In July of each year, each unit of local government with outstanding project development financing debt instruments shall make a report to any other unit, and to any special district as defined in G.S. 159-7, in which the development financing district for which the instruments were issued is located. This report shall set out the base valuation for the development financing district, the current valuation for the district, the amount of remaining project development financing debt for the district, and the unit's estimate of when the debt will be retired. The unit of local government may meet this requirement by reporting this information in its annual financial statements required by G.S. 159-34.

      - An amendment to this section by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 6, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, never took effect.

     <p>
      An earlier amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981 (Reg.

Such an amendment was proposed by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1247, was submitted to the people on Nov. 2, 1982, and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, did not go into effect.

The proceeds of revenue bonds shall be remitted to the trustee or other depository specified in the trust agreement or resolution securing them. Unless otherwise provided in the trust agreement or resolution securing the debt instruments, the proceeds of project development financing debt instruments shall be remitted in the manner provided by this section for the remission of the proceeds of general obligation bonds.

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - An amendment to this section by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 11, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, never took effect.

      An earlier amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981 (Reg.

Such an amendment was proposed by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1247, was submitted to the people on Nov. 2, 1982, and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, did not go into effect.

         Many of the cases cited below were decided under former statutory provisions similar to this section.
        </b>
       </span>
      </p>
      <p>
       Law Authorizing Bond Issue Need Not Declare Proportion of Proceeds Applicable to Each Specific Purpose.
   
   - A law authorizing a bond issue for various purposes which does not declare what proportion of the proceeds of the bonds shall be applied to each specific purpose is not void. Such matter may properly rest within the sound discretion of the municipal authorities. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Corporate Purpose."
   
   - A definition of corporate purpose cannot be static. Changing conditions require that application of the limitations be tempered with due recognition of the existing situation, so that the purpose for which the public body was organized may be accomplished and enjoyment thereof by the public made possible. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to Transfer and Allocate Funds.
   
   - Former G.S. 153-107, relating to application of proceeds of county bonds, did not place a limitation upon the legal right to transfer or allocate funds from one project to another included within the general purpose for which the bonds were issued. The inhibition contained in the statute was to prevent funds obtained for one general purpose from being transferred and used for another general purpose. For example, the statute prohibited the use of funds derived from the sale of bonds to erect, repair and equip school buildings from being used to erect or repair a courthouse or a county home or some similar project. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 484 (1949); Mauldin v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 501</cite>, 67 S.E.2d 647 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the municipality has a limited authority, under certain conditions, to transfer or allocate funds from one project to another included within the general purpose for which bonds are authorized, the transfer must be to a project included in the general purpose as stated in the bond resolution, and the funds may be diverted to the proposed purposes only in the event the municipality finds in good faith that conditions have so changed since the bonds were authorized that proceeds therefrom are no longer needed for the original purpose. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Including Specifics in Bond Order.
   
   - A bond order is not required to set out in detail the estimates of cost and descriptions of the particular projects for which the funds are proposed to be used, and their inclusion does not limit the allocation of the proceeds of the bonds, provided the use of the funds falls within the general purpose designated. Atkins v. McAden, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 752</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 484 (1949).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Immaterial or Temporary Changes Consistent with General Purpose Not Unlawful.
   
   - While the law will not justify the use of the proceeds of a State or municipal bond issue for purposes other than those specified in the act authorizing the issue, it does not follow that immaterial or temporary changes consistent with the general purpose of the legislative act should be interpreted as unlawful diversions of public funds. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Such changes as are necessary under existing conditions to accomplish the general purpose are not outlawed.
   
   Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Minor Changes Are Expected If Conditions Change.
   
   - Bond ordinances are passed authorizing indebtedness for certain stated purposes. When an authorizing vote is required, the bond money is earmarked for the stated purposes. However, in planning large permanent improvements the governing authorities look ahead to the future fulfillment of the construction plans. The authorities will inspect and examine the work as it progresses, and minor changes from time to time are expected if conditions change and unforeseen developments occur. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Emphasis Is Placed on Final Result to Be Accomplished.
   
   - In construing statutory limitations upon the use of bond money for public improvements, emphasis is placed on the final result sought to be accomplished. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Erection of Consolidated School Instead of Remodeling Old School.
   
   - Where a bond issue for the remodeling of the old school buildings in a county administrative unit was duly approved by the voters in an election, it was held that the board of county commissioners had the legal authority to allocate funds from this bond issue to the erection of a proposed consolidated high school, since this was not a change which involved any change of purpose for which the bonds were issued, but was only a change in the manner or method of accomplishing the original purpose. Feezor v. Siceloff, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 563</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 714 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to the use of bond money, the court will not interfere
   
   with the exercise of discretionary powers of a municipal corporation unless its actions are so unreasonable and arbitrary as to amount to an abuse of discretion. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Substantial Deviation from the Purpose for Which Bonds Were Approved.
   
   - Although the taxpayers argued that the proposed ballot language for the 2004 Park Bonds was intended to preclude the use of the property as a professional baseball stadium, when the 2004 Park Bond only restricted the expenditure of bond proceeds on a stadium for professional baseball, and the disbursed money was subsequently repaid, there was no substantial deviation from the purpose for which the bonds were approved under G.S. 159-135. Further, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa12s160A-265" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-265</a></cite>, made applicable to counties by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html#t153Aa08s153A-176" target="_blank">G.S. 153A-176</a></cite>, stated that counties may: (i) hold, use, change the use thereof to other uses; or (ii) sell or dispose of real and personal property, without regard to the method or purpose of its acquisition or to its intended or actual governmental or other prior use.

The unit shall determine the form and manner of execution of the bonds or notes, including any interest coupons to be attached thereto, and shall fix the denomination or denominations and the place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be any bank or trust company within or without the United States. In case any officer of the unit whose signature, or a facsimile of whose signature, appears on any bonds or notes or coupons, if any, ceases to be the officer before delivery thereof, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until the delivery. Any bond or note or coupon may bear the facsimile signatures of such persons who at the actual time or the execution thereof were the proper officers to sign although at the date of the bond or note or coupon these persons may not have been the proper officers. The unit may also provide for the authentication of the bonds or notes by a trustee or other authenticating agent. The bonds or notes may be issued as certificated or uncertificated obligations or both, and in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the unit may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds or notes as to principal alone and also as to both principal and interest, and for the reconversion into coupon bonds or notes of any bonds or notes registered as to both principal and interest, and for the interchange of registered and coupon bonds or notes. Any system for registration may be established as the unit may determine.

       Trust. - In the discretion of the unit of local government, any bonds and notes issued under the provisions of this section may be secured by a trust agreement by and between the unit and a corporate trustee or by a resolution providing for the appointment of a corporate trustee. Bonds and notes may also be issued under an order or resolution without a corporate trustee. The corporate trustee may be, in either case any trust company or bank having the powers of a trust company within or without the State. The trust agreement or resolution may pledge or assign such sources of revenue as may be permitted under this section. The trust agreement or resolution may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the owners of any bonds or notes issued thereunder as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the unit in respect of the purposes to which bond or note proceeds may be applied, the disposition and application of the revenues of the unit, the duties of the unit with respect to the project, the disposition of any charges and collection of any revenues and administrative charges, the terms and conditions of the issuance of additional bonds and notes, and the custody, safeguarding, investment, and application of all moneys. All bonds and notes issued under this section shall be equally and ratably secured by a lien upon the revenues pledged in the trust agreement or resolution, without priority by reasons of number, or dates of bonds or notes, execution, or delivery, in accordance with the provision of this section and of the trust agreement or resolution, except that the unit may provide in the trust agreement or resolution that bonds or notes issued pursuant thereto shall, to the extent and in the manner prescribed in the trust agreement or resolution, be subordinated and junior in standing, with respect to the payment of principal and interest and to the security thereof, to any other bonds or notes. It shall be lawful for any bank or trust company that may act as depository of the proceeds of bonds or notes, revenues, or any other money hereunder to furnish such indemnifying bonds or to pledge such securities as may be required by the unit. Any trust agreement or resolution may set out the rights and remedies of the owners of any bonds or notes and of any trustee, and may restrict the individual rights of action by the owners. In addition to the foregoing, any trust agreement or resolution may contain such other provisions as the unit may deem reasonable and proper for the security of the owners of any bonds or notes. Expenses incurred in carrying out the provisions of any trust agreement or resolution may be treated as a part of the cost of any project or as an administrative charge and may be paid from the revenues or from any other funds available.

Such bonds or notes are hereby made securities, which may properly and legally be deposited with and received by any officer or agency of the State or political subdivision of the State for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds, notes, or obligations of the State or any political subdivision is now or may hereafter be authorized by law.

Bonds may be issued partly for the purpose of refunding outstanding bonds and partly for any other purpose under this Article. Refunding bonds may be issued at any time prior to the final maturity of the debt or obligation to be refunded. The proceeds from the sale of any refunding bonds shall be applied only as follows: either, (i) to the immediate payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded or (ii) if not required for the immediate payment of the obligations being refunded such proceeds shall be deposited in trust to provide for the payment and retirement of the obligations being refunded, and to pay any expenses incurred in connection with such refunding. Money in any such trust fund may be invested in (i) direct obligations of the United States government, or (ii) obligations the principal of and interest on which are guaranteed by the United States government, or (iii) to the extent then permitted by law in obligations of any agency or instrumentality of the United States government, (iv) certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company located in the State of North Carolina if such certificates shall be secured by a pledge of any of said obligations described in (i), (ii), or (iii) above having any aggregate market value, exclusive of accrued interest, equal at least to the principal amount of the certificates so secured. Nothing herein shall be construed as a limitation on the duration of any deposit in trust for the retirement of obligations being refunded but which shall not have matured and which shall not be presently redeemable or, if presently redeemable, shall not have been called for redemption.

      No agreement or covenant shall contain a nonsubstitution clause which restricts the right of a unit of local government to replace or provide a substitute for any project financed pursuant to this section.

     <p>
      The sources of payment pledged by a unit of local government shall be specifically identified in the proceedings of the governing body authorizing the unit to issue the special obligation bonds or notes.
     </p>
     <p>
      After the issuance of special obligation bonds or notes, the governing body of the issuing unit may identify one or more additional sources of payment for the bonds or notes and pledge these sources, as long as the pledge of the sources does not constitute a pledge of the taxing power of the unit. Each source of additional payment pledged shall be specifically identified in the proceedings of the governing body of the unit pledging the source. The governing body of the unit may not pledge an additional source of revenue pursuant to this paragraph unless the pledge is first approved by the Local Government Commission pursuant to the procedures provided in subsection (k) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      The sources of payment so pledged and then held or thereafter received by a unit or any fiduciary thereof shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery of the sources or further act. The lien shall be valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against a unit without regard to whether the parties have notice thereof. The proceedings or any other document or action by which the lien on a source of payment is created need not be filed or recorded in any manner other than as provided in this section.

     <p>
      The Commission approval required by this subdivision is in addition to the Commission approval required by subsection (k) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      In determining whether a proposed bond or note issue should be approved, the Local Government Commission may consider, to the extent applicable as shall be determined by the Local Government Commission, the criteria set forth in G.S. 159-52 and G.S. 159-86, as either may be amended from time to time, as well as the effect of the proposed financing upon any scheduled or proposed sale of obligations by the State or by any of its agencies or departments or by any unit of local government in the State. The Local Government Commission shall approve the issuance of the bonds or notes if, upon the information and evidence it receives, it finds and determines that the proposed financing will satisfy such criteria and will effect the purposes of this section. An approval of an issue shall not be regarded as an approval of the legality of the issue in any respect. A decision by the Local Government Commission denying an application is final.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon the filing with the Local Government Commission of a written request of the unit requesting that its bonds or notes be sold, the bonds or notes may be sold by the Local Government Commission in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such price or prices as the Local Government Commission shall determine to be in the best interests of the unit and to effect the purposes of this section, if the sale is approved by the unit.
     </p>
     <p>
      The State does pledge to, and agree with, the holders of any bonds or notes issued by any unit that so long as any of the bonds or notes are outstanding and unpaid the State will not limit or alter the rights vested in the unit at the time of issuance of the bonds or notes to set the terms and conditions of the bonds or notes and to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the bondholders or noteholders. The State shall in no way impair the rights and remedies of the bondholders or noteholders until the bonds or notes and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceedings by or on behalf of the bondholders or noteholders, are fully paid, met, and discharged.

      If the Commission tentatively decides to deny the application because it cannot be supported from the information presented to it, it shall so notify the unit filing the information.

The Commission may appoint a hearing officer to conduct the hearing and to present a summary of the testimony and his recommendation for the Commission's consideration.

     </h3>
     <p>
      As used in this Part, the words "unit" or "issuing unit" means "unit of local government" as defined in G.S. 159-44 or G.S. 159-102, "municipality" as defined in G.S. 159-81, and the State of North Carolina.

      History

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - An amendment to this section by Session Laws 1993, c. 497, s. 12, was made effective upon certification of approval of an amendment to Article V of the Constitution of North Carolina relating to the authority of any county, city or town to borrow money, without the need of voter approval, and issue financing bonds to be used to finance public activities associated with private economic development projects. This amendment was submitted to the people on November 2, 1993 and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, never took effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      An earlier amendment to this section in Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1276, s. 9, was made effective on certification of approval of a State constitutional amendment authorizing the enactment of laws dealing with transactions of the type contemplated by the act. Such an amendment was proposed by Session Laws 1981 (Reg. Sess., 1982), c. 1247, was submitted to the people on Nov. 2, 1982, and was defeated. The amendment to this section, therefore, did not go into effect.

     <p>
      For provisions of ss. 21 through 25 of Session Laws 1983, c. 554, s. 19 of which amended this section, see the Editor's Note under G.S. 159-80.
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2003-403, s. 22, provides: "Liberal Construction. This act, being necessary for the prosperity and welfare of the State and its inhabitants, shall be liberally construed to effect these purposes."

     <p>
      At any time after a bond order has taken effect and with the approval of the Commission, the issuing unit may borrow money for the purposes for which the bonds are to be issued, in anticipation of the receipt of the proceeds of the sale of the bonds, and within the maximum authorized amount of the bond issue. General obligation bond anticipation notes shall be payable not later than seven years after the time the bond order takes effect and shall not be renewed or extended beyond such time, except that, if the issuance of bonds under the bond order is extended by an order of the board of the issuing unit which takes effect pursuant to G.S. 159-64, the bond anticipation notes may be renewed and extended and shall be payable not later than 10 years after the time the bond order takes effect and that, if the issuance of bonds under the bond order is prevented or prohibited by any order of any court, the bond anticipation notes may be renewed or extended by the length of time elapsing between the date of institution of the action or proceeding and the date of its final disposition. Any extension of the time for issuing bonds under a bond order granted by act of the General Assembly pursuant to G.S. 159-64 shall also extend the time for issuing and paying notes under this section for the same period of time.

      Notes issued in anticipation of the sale of project development financing debt instruments are special obligations of the issuing unit.

Notes issued in anticipation of the sale of project development financing debt instruments may be secured by the same pledges, charges, liens, covenants, and agreements made to secure the project development financing debt instruments. In addition, the proceeds of each project development financing debt instrument issue are pledged for the payment of any notes issued in anticipation of the sale of the instruments, and these notes shall be retired from the proceeds of the sale as the first priority.

     <p>
      If a unit of local government or municipality (as defined in G.S. 159-44, 159-81, or 159-102) fails to pay any installment of principal or interest on its outstanding debt on or before the due date (whether the debt is evidenced by general obligation bonds, revenue bonds, project development financing debt instruments, bond anticipation notes, tax anticipation notes, or revenue anticipation notes) and remains in default for 90 days, the Commission may take such action as it deems advisable to investigate the unit's or municipality's fiscal affairs, consult with its governing board, and negotiate with its creditors in order to assist the unit or municipality in working out a plan for refinancing, adjusting, or compromising the debt. When a plan is developed that the Commission finds to be fair and equitable and reasonably within the ability of the unit or municipality to meet, the Commission shall enter an order finding that it is fair, equitable, and within the ability of the unit or municipality to meet. The Commission shall then advise the governing board to take the necessary steps to implement it. If the governing board declines or refuses to do so within 90 days after receiving the Commission's advice, the Commission may enter an order directing the governing board to implement the plan. When this order is entered, the members of the governing board and all officers and employees of the unit or municipality shall be under an affirmative duty to do all things necessary to implement the plan. The Commission may apply to the appropriate division of the General Court of Justice for a court order to the governing board and other officers and employees of the unit or municipality to enforce the Commission's order.

Before the Commission assumes full control of an enterprise system as described in this subsection, it must find that the impact of items (i) through (iii) threatens the financial stability of the unit or public authority, and that the unit or public authority has failed to make corrective changes in its operation of the enterprise system after having received notice and warning from the Commission. The notice and warning may occur prior to the expiration of the three-year period.

For purposes of this subsection, the term "working capital" means current assets, such as cash, inventory, and accounts receivable, less current liabilities, determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and the phrase "quick ratio of less than 1.0" means that the ratio of liquid assets, cash and receivables, to current liabilities is less than 1.0.

      </h4>
      <p>
       Foundation of Public Officers' Liability.
   
   - The foundation of liability of public officers can be expressed as follows: However honest the defendants may be, the public has a right to be protected against the wrongful conduct of their servants, if there is carelessness amounting to a willful want of care in the discharge of their official duties, which injures the public. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The elements of approving a false claim
   
   in violation of this section are (1) that defendant was a finance officer, other officer or employee of local government, (2) that in such capacity she approved a claim or bill, and (3) that at the time she approved the claim or bill she knew it was fraudulent, erroneous or otherwise invalid. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The elements of making a false report
   
   in violation of this section are (1) that defendant was a finance officer, other officer or employee of local government, (2) that the written statement was required by rules and regulations established by the local government for the lawful disbursement of funds, and (3) that defendant made a written statement on a voucher knowing that a portion of it was false. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The State was not required to elect between offenses
   
   of approving a false claim in violation of this section and making a false report, since the elements of the two charges were not the same. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Corrupt Intent Need Not Be Proved.
   
   - In order for the State to prove official misconduct proscribed by this section, it is not necessary for the State to prove a corrupt intent or willful design to cheat and defraud the public. Every public officer is bound to perform the duties of his office faithfully, to use reasonable skill and diligence, and to act primarily for the benefit of the public. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Submission of Charges to Jury.
   
   - Where the evidence showed that expenditures contained both valid and invalid items, the court properly submitted the charges of approving an invalid claim and failure to preaudit to the jury. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 526, 269 S.E.2d 291, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 237</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).

       Editor's Note.
      </b>
      - The preamble to Session Laws 2003-388 reads: "Whereas, the State Treasurer's Office formed a Public Finance Advisory Committee comprised of representative city and county governments, as well as the public finance bar and financial services sectors, to review and propose changes to the General Statutes dealing with public finance in an effort to strengthen, modernize, and provide for the most efficient method of issuing of public debt by local governments and other political subdivisions of the State; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the Public Finance Advisory Committee has developed, and the State Treasurer's Office has reviewed, a set of recommendations to the General Assembly for specific changes to relevant General Statutes around which there is consensus that the proposed changes are beneficial to local governments in their issuance of public debt; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the Local Government Commission remains the statutorily designated entity to which all proposed issuances must be submitted for approval, and these recommendations in no way lower or lessen the level of due diligence performed in determining the appropriateness of a specific issuance; and
     </p>

       Subject to the provisions of this Article, a governmental unit may from time to time purchase, enter into, modify, amend, or terminate one or more swap agreements that it determines are necessary or desirable in connection with the issuance, incurrence, carrying, or securing of obligations. This authorization also includes the authority to enter into modifications or reversals of a swap agreement previously entered into by the governmental unit and the authority to enter into a swap agreement that modifies the interest rate payment calculation method under a swap agreement previously entered into to another interest rate calculation method or that reverses, in whole or in part, the effect of a prior swap agreement on the governmental unit's interest rate cost or risk. A swap agreement entered into by a governmental unit may contain any provisions, including provisions regarding payments, term, termination payments, security, default, and remedies, and may be with any parties, that the governmental unit determines are necessary or desirable.
      </li>
      <li id="t159sIVa13s159-194ol1b">
       No governmental unit shall enter into a swap agreement pursuant to this Article other than for the primary purpose of managing interest rate risk on or interest rate costs of its obligations. A swap agreement may provide that the payments thereunder are based upon a fixed or variable interest rate calculation method. A governmental unit shall not engage in the business of acting as a dealer in swap agreements. A swap agreement may be entered into in connection with specific obligations of the governmental unit, which may consist of multiple series or issues of obligations as specified by the governmental unit. The swap agreement may be entered into at a time before, at the same time as, or after, the obligations are issued or incurred by the governmental unit. Each swap agreement may be entered for a notional amount up to, but not exceeding, the principal amount of the obligations with respect to which the swap agreement is entered. A swap agreement may have a term as long as, or less than, the term of the obligations with respect to which the swap agreement is entered.

       In connection with entering into a swap agreement, a governmental unit may enter into credit enhancement agreements to secure the obligations of the governmental unit under the swap agreement, with any payment, security, default, remedy, and other terms and conditions that the governmental unit determines, including entering into binding agreements to deliver collateral, either at the time the swap agreement is entered into or at future times under conditions set forth in the swap agreement.

       § 159-195. Nature of duties of a governmental unit under a swap agreement.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The duty of a governmental unit to make the payments required and to perform the other duties of the governmental unit under a swap agreement shall constitute a continuing contractual obligation of the governmental unit, enforceable in accordance with applicable law for the enforcement of contractual obligations of that governmental unit. A governmental unit may limit its duties under a swap agreement to designated property or a designated source of revenues or receipts of the governmental unit, such as the revenues of a specified utility or other public service enterprise system of the governmental unit. If a governmental unit enters into a swap agreement in connection with obligations that are secured by a designated form of security, then, subject to the terms of the bond order or resolution, trust indenture or trust agreement, installment contract or lease purchase agreement, or similar instrument pursuant to which the obligations are issued or incurred, the governmental unit may pledge, mortgage, or grant a security interest in the revenues of the utility or other public service enterprise system, program, receipts, property, or similar arrangement securing the obligations to secure the payment and performance of its duties under the swap agreement. Any pledge of assets, revenues, or receipts to secure the duties of a governmental unit under a swap agreement shall become effective in the same manner and to the same extent as a pledge of those assets, revenues, or receipts to secure the obligations with respect to which the swap agreement is entered.

         The proposed expansion of the existing landfill, or construction of the new landfill, for which debt is to be incurred is necessary to ensure reliable, convenient, and affordable solid waste disposal service is provided consistently to all citizens under its jurisdiction for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare.

         The proposed expansion of the existing landfill, or construction of the new landfill, will result in lower overall costs per ton of waste disposed for the jurisdiction's citizens and businesses within the jurisdiction than would be available through privately funded and operated disposal facilities. The analysis shall take into account all direct, indirect, asset retirement, closure, post-closure, and capital costs divided by tons disposed per year to establish a "tip fee" required to support the operation and repayment of the debt. State or federal subsidies shall be disregarded for purposes of this analysis.

         The requirements of subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subsection have been confirmed by way of a bid or request for proposals process in which private businesses have been invited to compete for the right to provide the services subject only to compliance with State and federal law. Private company proposals will be on a "tip fee" basis for comparison to the unit of local government landfill tip fee calculated pursuant to subdivision (2) of this subsection.

       In determining whether debt for expansion of an existing landfill, or construction of a new landfill, shall be approved, the Commission shall consider the information submitted pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and shall approve an application only if it finds the information presented supports the need for, and cost-effectiveness of, the proposed project. If the Commission tentatively decides to deny the application because it is of the opinion that these criteria cannot be supported from the information presented to it, it shall so notify the unit filing the application. Prior to final approval of the application, the Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application at which time any interested persons shall be heard, including any private business that has offered an alternative. The Commission may appoint a hearing officer to conduct the hearing and to present a summary of the testimony and associated recommendations for the Commission's consideration.

       The requirements of this section shall only apply to a unit of local government, which, at the time it submits an application to the Commission for approval to enter debt for expansion or construction of a landfill, has adopted an ordinance pursuant to G.S. 130A-291(c). Provided, however, where such debt is approved and the requirements of this section have not been satisfied, a unit of local government that later seeks to adopt an ordinance pursuant to G.S. 130A-291(c), must meet the requirements of this section prior to adopting and enforcing such an ordinance.
