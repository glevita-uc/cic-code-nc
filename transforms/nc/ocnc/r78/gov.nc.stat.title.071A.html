            together as a single community, shall, from and after July 20, 1971, be designated and officially recognized as the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation of North Carolina, and shall continue to enjoy all their rights, privileges, and immunities

        </h3>
        <p>
            In recognition of the governmental relationship between the State, federally recognized Indian tribes and the United States, a federally recognized Indian tribe may conduct games consistent with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, Public Law 100-497, that
            are in accordance with a valid Tribal-State compact executed by the Governor pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.147.html#t147a03s147-12" target="_blank">G.S. 147-12(14)</a></cite> and approved by the U.S.
            Department of Interior under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and such games shall not be unlawful or against the public policy of the State if the State permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity.

            State Law Does Not Violate Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. - Trial court erred in concluding that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S.
            <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span> 2701 through 2721, precluded North Carolina from granting the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina exclusive Class III gaming rights because State law providing the Tribe with exclusive gaming rights did not violate
            Indian Gaming Regulatory Act since the General Assembly expressed the public policy of the State through G.S. 71A-8, which explicitly authorized Indian gaming in accordance with IGRA, and G.S. 14-306.1A, which criminalized Class III gaming
            except for the Tribe's enterprises; 2006 N.C. Sess. Laws 6, which legalizes the Class III gaming rights of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians of North Carolina, satisfies the requirement of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C.S.
