       Budget Accountability And Transparency Reform Initiative.
      </b> - Session Laws 2018-5, s. 6.3(a)-(e), provides: "(a) Finding and Purpose. - The General Assembly finds that the State budget is its central policy document and primary vehicle for directing the provision of programs and
                    services to the citizens of the State. As such, the State's budget must be clear, transparent, and credible if it is to serve as a basis of accountability to its citizens. Therefore, it is the intent of the General Assembly to provide
                    flexibility and support to the Governor in continuing efforts to effectuate the necessary changes to the structure and presentation of the State budget. The purpose of the Budget Accountability and Transparency Reform Initiative established
                    by this section is to ensure the highest level of transparency for meaningful review of the State budget by all citizens of the State.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) Base Budget Reform Plan Pilot. - The Office of State Budget and Management and the Department of Public Safety (Department) shall develop jointly and execute a base budget reform plan for the Department that ensures all of the following:
                </p>

                <p>
                    "(4) An annual base budget document for the Department that:

                    budget. The Department, with the approval of the Office of State Budget and Management, shall build its line-item budgets, including elimination of vacant positions to more closely align with actual requirements and anticipated receipts
                    for each of the programs and purposes contained in the Governor's Recommended Base Budget for the Department. The Department must budget receipts based on historical trends. Under no circumstances may the Department move receipts between
                    programs and purposes. The Department's newly aligned line-item budgets shall be submitted to the General Assembly as part of the Governor's Recommended Base Budget for the 2019-2021 fiscal biennium.

                        Appropriation of Federal Block Grant Funds. - Governor's claim challenging the General Assembly's appropriation of federal block grant funds awarded to the State was properly dismissed as the block grant funds were, despite their source in the federal
                        government, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly because Congress left the issue of state legislative appropriation of federal block grants for each state to determine; and, while some federal funds could be considered
                        custodial agency funds, the State Budget Act treated federal block grants as state funds subject to appropriation through the statutory budgetary process, and the Governor did not identify any federal prohibition against treating
                        the block grant funds as state funds subject to legislative appropriation. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 837 S.E.2d 7 (2019).

                        Appropriation of Federal Block Grant Funds. - Governor's claim challenging the General Assembly's appropriation of federal block grant funds awarded to the State was properly dismissed as the block grant funds were, despite their source in the federal
                        government, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly because Congress left the issue of state legislative appropriation of federal block grants for each state to determine; and, while some federal funds could be considered
                        custodial agency funds, the State Budget Act treated federal block grants as state funds subject to appropriation through the statutory budgetary process, and the Governor did not identify any federal prohibition against treating
                        the block grant funds as state funds subject to legislative appropriation. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 837 S.E.2d 7 (2019).

                        Appropriation of Federal Block Grant Funds. - Governor's claim challenging the General Assembly's appropriation of federal block grant funds awarded to the State was properly dismissed as the block grant funds were, despite their source in the federal
                        government, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly because Congress left the issue of state legislative appropriation of federal block grants for each state to determine; and, while some federal funds could be considered
                        custodial agency funds, the State Budget Act treated federal block grants as state funds subject to appropriation through the statutory budgetary process, and the Governor did not identify any federal prohibition against treating
                        the block grant funds as state funds subject to legislative appropriation. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 837 S.E.2d 7 (2019).

                    However, the General Assembly lacks information regarding the specific services that are purchased with those county funds. The General Assembly also lacks data regarding the incomes of persons receiving mental health, developmental
                    disabilities, and substance abuse services that are paid for by either State or county funds. This lack of data severely limits the General Assembly's ability to determine the distribution of services that are being paid for with public
                    funds, whether persons who are eligible for Medicaid are being enrolled in that program, and whether expanding the State's Medicaid eligibility criteria would impact a significant number of mental health, developmental disabilities,
                    and substance abuse services consumers. Therefore, LMEs shall report annually to the Division all expenditures from county funds by the LME for services, start-up expenses, and capital and operational expenditures, regardless of the
                    source of the funds and regardless of whether the funds were earned on a payment for service or grant basis. This reporting shall include specific information regarding the expenditure of all funds provided to the LME by the county
                    or counties contained in the LME's catchment area and the amount of expenditures for services provided by the multicounty LME to residents of each county in the multicounty LME's catchment area. To the extent possible, the information
                    shall be submitted through the Integrated Payment and Reimbursement System. LMEs shall also gather income data for all individuals receiving services. Notwithstanding <cite class="octn"><a href="#t143Ca06s143C-6-4" target="_self">G.S. 143C-6-4</a></cite>,

                        Construction - G.S. 143-16.3 did not prohibit a state agency from committing the state to the expenditure of funds which had not been appropriated for the purpose of a contract, because the pertinent portion of G.S. 143-16.3 stated that no funds from
                        any source could be expended for any new or expanded purpose, position or other expenditure for which the General Assembly had considered but not enacted an appropriation of funds for the current fiscal budget; thus, G.S. 143-16.3
                        only prohibited the actual expenditure of funds if not appropriated. N.C. Monroe Constr. Co. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 320, 574 S.E.2d 482 (2002), cert. denied, cert. dismissed,

                        Appropriation of Federal Block Grant Funds. - Governor's claim challenging the General Assembly's appropriation of federal block grant funds awarded to the State was properly dismissed as the block grant funds were, despite their source in the federal
                        government, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly because Congress left the issue of state legislative appropriation of federal block grants for each state to determine; and, while some federal funds could be considered
                        custodial agency funds, the State Budget Act treated federal block grants as state funds subject to appropriation through the statutory budgetary process, and the Governor did not identify any federal prohibition against treating
                        the block grant funds as state funds subject to legislative appropriation. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 837 S.E.2d 7 (2019).
