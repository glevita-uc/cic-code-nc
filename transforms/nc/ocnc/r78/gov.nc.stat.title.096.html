      "Whereas, the total collected by the State in unemployment insurance taxes in the 12-month period ending December 2010 amounted to $955,200,000, while the sum paid in unemployment insurance benefits for the same period totaled $1,900,000,000; and

      Session Laws 2011-10, ss. 1-4, provide: "1. The General Assembly finds that the State must take swift and prudent action to address the two billion five hundred million dollars ($2,500,000,000) in debt liability for unemployment insurance benefits currently owed to the federal government and the substantial deficit in the North Carolina Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. To that end, the Department of Commerce shall contract with an independent consulting firm specializing in unemployment insurance and employment security reform to obtain recommendations on what tax structure changes would be fair to the employers of North Carolina and how these revenues, and other financial options, might be used in servicing and liquidating the State's debt and deficits incurred to pay unemployment insurance benefits.

A contract to obtain services of a consultant pursuant to this act is not subject to Article 3C of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html" target="_blank">Chapter 143</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The consultation contract may be funded from (i) funds available within the Employment Security Commission, including State funds and any federal funds that may be used for the purposes of this act, and (ii) non-State or nongovernmental funds, grants, and in-kind contributions specifically designated for the purpose of carrying out the analysis required by this act.

     </p>
     <p>
      "4. The Employment Security Commission and the Department of Revenue shall cooperate fully with the Department of Commerce, the Fiscal Research Division, and the Program Evaluation Division by giving all information and all data within their possession or ascertainable from their records necessary to carry out the purposes of this act."

        One of the major purposes of the Employment Security Act
   
   was to provide a fund by systematic accumulations during periods of employment to be retained and used for the benefit of persons furloughed from their jobs through no fault of their own. In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The General Assembly may determine the scope of this Chapter,
   
   and the definitions and tests prescribed will be applied by the courts in accordance with the legislative intent. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. City Ice &amp; Coal Co., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 6</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 290 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction in Favor of Applicants.
   
   - The Employment Security Act is to be liberally construed in favor of applicants. Marlow v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 493 S.E.2d 302 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 577</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 595 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction in Favor of Validity.
   
   - The intent of the legislature to provide a wide scope in the application of this Chapter to mitigate the economic evils of unemployment and to bring within its provisions employments therein defined beyond the scope of existing definitions or categories is apparent from the language used, and all doubts as to constitutionality should be resolved in favor of the validity of the Chapter and all its provisions. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 4 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "Employment Security Law" must be construed to promote and not to defeat the legislative policy as declared in this Chapter, and the courts will not construe the Chapter in such manner as to discourage parties from entering into contracts designed to lessen the hardships incident to termination of employment. In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 662</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 854 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Weight to Be Given Federal Construction.
   
   - Our State Unemployment Compensation Act (now Employment Security Law) was passed pursuant to a plan national in scope, and therefore serious consideration is to be given to the construction placed upon similar language of the federal statute by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, but the interpretation of the Act is finally for our courts, and neither the ruling of the Commissioner nor that of the State Unemployment Compensation Commission (now Employment Security Commission) is conclusive. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 491</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 592 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Illustrative Cases.
   
   - The Commission's findings of fact, which were in conflict over when the discharge actually occurred, could not support the finding that the misconduct occurred after employee was discharged.

        Definitions and Tests Applied According to Legislative Intent.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Common-Law Relationship of Master and Servant Extended.
   
   - Employments taxable under this Chapter are not confined to the common-law relationship of master and servant, but the legislature, under its power to determine employments which shall be subject to the tax, has, by the definitions contained in the Chapter and the administrative procedure set up therein for determining whether an employment is subject to the Chapter, enlarged its coverage beyond the common-law definition of master and servant, and the scope of the Chapter must be determined upon the facts of each particular case. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. National Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 576</cite>, 14 S.E.2d 689, 139 A.L.R. 895 (1941). See State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. L.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose.
   
   - The General Assembly has stated the policy of this State is that the compulsory reserves required under the Employment Security Law be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own. In order to carry out the intent of the act its provisions should be liberally construed in favor of applicants. By contrast, our courts have said that sections of the act imposing disqualifications for its benefits should be strictly construed in favor of the claimant and should not be enlarged by implication. Couch v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 366 S.E.2d 574, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 472</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 440 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Liberal Construction.
   
   - The terms "employment," "employer," "employing unit," "wages," and "remuneration" as used in this Chapter must be liberally construed to effectuate its purpose to relieve the evils of unemployment, and the definition of the terms as contained in the Chapter are controlling and are broader than the common-law meaning of the terms, and the Chapter includes in its scope relationships which might be excluded by a strict common-law application of the definition of an independent contractor. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Jefferson Std. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 479</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 584 (1939).
   <br />

        As to rules for determining whether an individual is an "employee" or an "independent contractor,"
   
   see State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Faulk, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 363 S.E.2d 225, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 480</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 917 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Reinstatement of Liability After Prior Exemption.
   
   - Where an employer, otherwise subject to the provisions of this Chapter, is exempted from those provisions by legislative action, and by legislative action that exemption is subsequently terminated, and, additionally, where there have been no changes in the circumstances or activities of the employer, upon reinstatement of liability under this Chapter that employer is entitled to credit for its prior account balance, and that employer's contribution rate should be determined primarily by reference to its former experience rating at the time of its exemption. The burden will be upon the commission to show what, if any, changes in circumstances have come about which would justify an upward revision of that employer's rate of contribution. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Blue Ridge Broadcasting Corp., <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 702, 257 S.E.2d 640, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 805</cite>, 262 S.E.2d 4 (1979).

       <p>
        Former Subdivision (4) Construed.
   
   - Former subdivision (4) merely determined who should be liable for the contributions to the Commission on wages paid to employees as between an employing unit and a contractor or subcontractor under certain specified circumstances.

   - Subdivision (5)b of this section is a definitive statute by which it can be determined whether or not an employing unit which is the transferee of all, substantially all, or a part of an organization, trade, or business of another, is subject to the provisions of the Employment Security Law and required to make the contributions as provided therein. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. News Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 332</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 391 (1947). But see the 1949 amendment to G.S. 96-9(c)(4).
       </p>
       <p>
        In subdivision (5)b of this section, the employing unit that acquires only a part of the organization, trade, or business of another is expressly exempted from the lien imposed by G.S. 96-10(d) on the assets transferred, although the former owner may not have paid all the contributions due at the time of the transfer. If it had been the intent and purpose of the legislature, in enacting G.S. 96-9(c)(4) (now repealed), to authorize the transfer of such percentage of the reserve account as the transferred assets bear to the entire assets of the transferor, when only a part of the organization, trade, or business is transferred, then there would be no sound reason for exempting such assets from the provisions of G.S. 96-10(d). State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. News Publishing Co., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 332</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 391 (1947). But see the 1949 amendment to

       </p>
       <p>
        Read in context, subdivision (5)b of this section contemplates a transaction in which the purchaser, instead of buying physical assets as such, succeeds in some real sense to the organization, trade or business, or some part thereof, of a covered employer, ordinarily as a going concern. The underlying idea is that of continuity, the new employing unit succeeding to and continuing the business or some part thereof of the former employing unit. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Skyland Crafts, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 727</cite>, 83 S.E.2d 893 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant company was composed of new persons, engaged in a new business, under a new name, and did not purchase the predecessor's accounts receivable, customer lists, goodwill, right to use trade name, or any assets except the equipment and raw materials in the plant, there was no continuity of organization, trade or business such as is contemplated by subdivision (5)b of this section. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Skyland Crafts, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 727</cite>, 83 S.E.2d 893 (1954).

       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (5)d Construed.
   
   - The provision that enterprises "controlled" by the same "interests" shall be considered a single employing unit, as contained in former subdivision (5)d of this section, was given the distinct, definite and commonly understood meaning of its wording. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. City Ice &amp; Coal Co., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 6</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 290 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the three defendant corporations had common officers and directors and substantially identical stockholders, and maintained a central business office where each kept its records and handled all clerical matters, the three corporations were owned and controlled directly or indirectly by the same interests within the meaning of former subdivision (5)d of this section and constituted but a single employing unit within the meaning of the section. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. City Ice &amp; Coal Co., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 6</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 290 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former subdivision (5)d of this section, relating to employing units owned or controlled by the same interests, etc., when properly interpreted and applied, was not open to successful attack on the ground that it would result in the deprivation of property without due process of law or constitute a denial of the equal protection of the law. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 4 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        An individual who operated three places of business, employing in the aggregate more than eight employees, was an "employer" as defined in former subdivision (5)d of this section, relating to employing units owned or controlled by the same interests, etc. State ex rel.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (6)a Construed.
   
   - The employment contemplated by subdivision (6)a was to be one for personal services rendered for remuneration. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Tinnin, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 75</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 884 (1951).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (6)f Construed.
   
   - Where services were rendered for remuneration, subdivision (6)f of this section formerly provided that the burden was on the party for whose benefit the services were rendered to prove that they were rendered free from his control or direction over the performance of such services, that they were outside the usual course of the business for which the services were performed, and that the person performing the service was customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession, or business; and, since the matters of exemption were stated conjunctively, all three elements were required to be shown in order that exemption from the Chapter could be secured. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Jefferson Std. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 479</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 584 (1939); State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subparagraph (6)k Construed.
   
   - The enactment in 1977 of subdivisions (5)q and (6)j of this section, which deleted a previous exemption from unemployment tax liability for nonprofit elementary and secondary schools, did not change the effect of the exemption in subparagraph (6)k of this section for persons performing services in the employ of a church organization operated primarily for religious purposes. Begley v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 432, 274 S.E.2d 370 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the 1949 amendment to subdivisions (6)(a) and (f),
   
   it was held that the provisions of the Employment Security Law classifying and designating those persons who are subject to the provisions of this Chapter, rather than the common-law definition of the relationship of master and servant, were controlling, when not capricious or unreasonable. And the burden was upon the employer to show to the satisfaction of the Employment Security Commission that persons performing services came within the exceptions enumerated in former paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 of subdivision (6)f. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Champion Distrib. Co., <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 464</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 674 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        While subdivision (10)a of this section requires a claimant to be "unemployed"
   
   as statutorily defined before receiving benefits, neither this statute nor any other in the Employment Security Law requires one to be unemployed before filing a claim or makes filing a claim determinative of the fact of unemployment. Wright v. Bus Term. Restaurant, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 395, 322 S.E.2d 201 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the law, facts such as unemployment and its cause are determined by evidence,
   
   rather than statutory implication. Wright v. Bus Term. Restaurant, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 395, 322 S.E.2d 201 (1984).

        One is not entitled to unemployment benefits merely because he meets the legislative definition of "totally unemployed."

       <p>
        A unilateral, substantial reduction in one's working hours by his employer
   
   may permit a finding of good cause attributable to the employer. Couch v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 366 S.E.2d 574, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 472</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 440 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Deferment of Benefits Until Exhaustion of Severance and Vacation Pay.
   
   - Discharged employees who are entitled under a contract to severance and vacation pay are not entitled to unemployment benefits until the moneys paid as severance and vacation pay have been exhausted by time elapsed at the employees' weekly wage rate. In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 662</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 854 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that the legislature not only amended the definition of "wages" in 1953, but added, in 1955, a disqualifying provision, was clear evidence of its intent to prevent the collection of unemployment benefits so long as the employee had vacation or severance pay payable to him. It was a clear declaration that the legislature did not intend that an employer should be required to provide greater compensation to an unemployed individual than to the same individual when at work. In re Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 662</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 854 (1961).

       <p>
        Employee Is Entitled to Benefits If He Does Not Work and Is Not Paid for Services.
   
   - A laid-off employee is entitled to insurance benefits under the State law if he is totally unemployed; that is, if he does not work, and is not paid and not due pay for services. In re Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 559</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 393 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Payments Under Supplemental Unemployment Benefit Plan.
   
   - Under the wage and service test fixed by this section, payments to laid-off employees under a supplemental unemployment benefit plan do not constitute wages. In re Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 559</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 393 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Benefits received by a laid-off employee from a trust fund set up pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement should not be deducted from unemployment insurance benefits due such employee under the Employment Security Act. In re Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 559</cite>, 122 S.E.2d 393 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits.
   
   - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina, there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow v. Holland Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 695, 308 S.E.2d 335 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 308</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 651 (1984).

       <p>
        The United States Secretary of Labor was not a necessary party
   
   to an action to determine whether the unemployment tax statutes applied to employees of schools operated by the Roman Catholic Church in North Carolina on the grounds that State unemployment laws must follow federal statutes in order for the State to gain a credit against the federal unemployment tax and thus obtain funds to operate State employment offices and that the United States Secretary of Labor has interpreted the federal statutes to include parochial and parish schools within the scope of the federal unemployment tax provisions, since that action in no way involved an interpretation of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.

        Corporation Acting as Contractee and Not Mere Lessor.
   
   - The corporate defendant operated a department store. Upon the discontinuance of its shoe department, it entered into a contract with the individual defendant under which he occupied space in the store at a rental of a fixed percentage of the gross and carried on the shoe business under the name of the corporation, with full authority to hire and fire employees and order stock, but under which the corporation required money from sales to be turned over to it immediately as received, controlled the extension of credit and owned all accounts, paid sales taxes and advertised in its own name with the individual defendant paying for the proportion of advertising devoted to shoes. It was held that the corporation was a contractee and not a mere landlord, and that the corporation was liable under former subdivision (4) for unemployment compensation tax on wages paid by the individual to his employees for the period of operation prior to the amendment of 1945.

   - Where, prior to the purchase of the business by defendant, there had been employed therein more than eight individuals for 12 weeks during the calendar year, and defendant, after purchasing the business, employs more than eight employees for 16 weeks during the remainder of the year, defendant is an employer required to pay contributions upon the wages of his employees under the provisions of the Employment Security Act.

        ESC to Be Treated as Employer.
   
   - The reasoning of the Court of Appeals erroneously treated Employment Security Commission (ESC) as an agency appealing its own agency decision rather than as an "aggrieved party" where ESC appealed to Superior Court not as an agency decision-maker, but as an employer aggrieved by the agency action. ESC-employer was liable to pay for unemployment insurance benefits the same as any other employer and had the same rights of appeal as any other employer; thus, ESC-employer had the status of "aggrieved party" under ESC Regulation 21.18(D) and had appeal rights as such.

   - Evidence that a municipal corporation sold certain standing timber to defendant at a stipulated price per thousand board feet, and that in connection with the purchase, defendant agreed to remove all sawdust, to keep the bushes down and to pile no brush on the premises of the corporation, supported the finding of the Employment Security Commission that the defendant was not in the employ of the municipal corporation, within the meaning of this section.

        Insurance Soliciting Agents.
   
   - Soliciting agents and managers, in their capacity as soliciting agents, are subject to a high degree of control by the insurance company employing them under their written contract, and usually their services are rendered to the company in the offices of the company, and are directly related and contribute to the primary purpose for which the company is organized, and therefore their services constitute an "employment" within this Chapter. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Jefferson Std. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 479</cite>, 2 S.E.2d 584 (1939). But see subdivision (6) of this section.

        Private nurse's assistant was an independent contractor

        Salesmen.
   
   - The evidence tended to show that the services performed by defendant's salesmen were in the usual course of defendant's business, that goods were loaded on the salesmen's cars on defendant's premises, and the unsold goods returned there, that the salesmen were bonded, were allotted territory by defendant, were not permitted to sell any competitor's merchandise, paid no license or sales tax, were reported as employees in federal returns and their taxes deducted from the payroll, were required to turn in all money for goods sold and were paid weekly on a commission basis. Therefore, the evidence supports the finding of the Employment Security Commission that the salesmen were "employees" within the meaning of this section. State ex rel. Employment Sec. Comm'n v.

       § 96-2. Declaration of State public policy.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As a guide to the interpretation and application of this Chapter, the public policy of this State is declared to be as follows: Economic insecurity due to unemployment is a serious menace to the health, morals, and welfare of the people of this State. Involuntary unemployment is therefore a subject of general interest and concern which requires appropriate action by the legislature to prevent its spread and to lighten its burden which now so often falls with crushing force upon the unemployed worker and his family. The achievement of social security requires protection against this greatest hazard of our economic life. This can be provided by encouraging employers to provide more stable employment and by the systematic accumulation of funds during periods of employment to provide benefits for periods of unemployment, thus maintaining purchasing power and limiting the serious social consequences of poor relief assistance. The legislature, therefore, declares that in its considered judgment the public good and the general welfare of the citizens of this State require the enactment of this measure, under the police powers of the State, for the compulsory setting aside of unemployment reserves to be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own.

      - The preamble to Session Laws 2011-10, provides: "Whereas, North Carolina's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund balance had a deficit of $2,500,000,000, as of December 31, 2010, according to the Employment Security Commission; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the State owes the federal government $2,500,000,000 for loan liabilities incurred by the Employment Security Commission to continue unemployment insurance benefits payments to jobless North Carolinians during the current economic crisis; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the total collected by the State in unemployment insurance taxes in the 12-month period ending December 2010 amounted to $955,200,000, while the sum paid in unemployment insurance benefits for the same period totaled $1,900,000,000; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, businesses large and small pay into the unemployment insurance system with the expectation that their contributions will be sufficient to provide assistance to their qualified former jobless employees; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, it is in the best interest of the employers and employees of this State to have the most efficient and cost-effective unemployment insurance tax structure; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the current unemployment insurance tax structure no longer serves the businesses and citizens of this State in the manner required by these and future economic times; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, major reforms regarding the unemployment insurance tax structure must be developed and implemented as soon as practicable; Now, therefore."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-10, ss. 1-4, provide: "1. The General Assembly finds that the State must take swift and prudent action to address the two billion five hundred million dollars ($2,500,000,000) in debt liability for unemployment insurance benefits currently owed to the federal government and the substantial deficit in the North Carolina Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. To that end, the Department of Commerce shall contract with an independent consulting firm specializing in unemployment insurance and employment security reform to obtain recommendations on what tax structure changes would be fair to the employers of North Carolina and how these revenues, and other financial options, might be used in servicing and liquidating the State's debt and deficits incurred to pay unemployment insurance benefits.
     </p>

      "2. A contract to obtain services of a consultant pursuant to this act is not subject to Article 3C of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html" target="_blank">Chapter 143</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The consultation contract may be funded from (i) funds available within the Employment Security Commission, including State funds and any federal funds that may be used for the purposes of this act, and (ii) non-State or nongovernmental funds, grants, and in-kind contributions specifically designated for the purpose of carrying out the analysis required by this act.

      "3. The Department of Commerce shall provide the Fiscal Research Division and the Program Evaluation Division with periodic updates on the progress of the analysis. Within 45 days from the completion of the independent consultant's analysis, the Department of Commerce shall report to the Governor and to the General Assembly on the independent consultant's recommendations for reform of the State's unemployment insurance tax structure.

The Employment Security Commission and the Department of Revenue shall cooperate fully with the Department of Commerce, the Fiscal Research Division, and the Program Evaluation Division by giving all information and all data within their possession or ascertainable from their records necessary to carry out the purposes of this act."

       Legislative Intent.
   
   - The legislature has sought to provide aid to those out of work through no fault of their own. In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The matter of policy is in the exclusive province of the legislature

      <p>
       Provisions of G.S. 96-14 Prevail over General Policy of this Section.
   
   - A specific ground for disqualifying an employee from unemployment benefits in G.S. 96-14, "when applicable," prevails over the general policy in this section of providing benefits to workers who are "unemployed through no fault of their own."

       Construction in Favor of Granting Claims.
   
   - Statutory provisions allowing disqualification from benefits must be strictly construed in favor of granting claims. Marlow v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 493 S.E.2d 302 (1997), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 577</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 595 (1998).

      </p>
      <p>
       The Employment Security Act was designed to provide protection against economic insecurity due to unemployment and should be liberally construed in favor of applicants. Eason v. Gould, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 311 S.E.2d 372 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 618</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 223 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Employment Security Act was not designed to provide the payment of benefits to a person who is physically unable to work or who, for any other personal reason, would at no time be in a position to accept any employment if it were tendered to him, however capable and industrious such person may be. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The section must be construed to provide benefits to one who becomes involuntarily unemployed, who is physically able to work, who is available for work at suitable employment, and who, although actively seeking work, is unable to find such employment through no fault of his or her own. Barnes v. Singer Co., <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 213</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 756 (1989).

       This Act does not contemplate penalizing workers who choose in favor of their own health,
   
   safety or ethical standards and against an affirmative or de facto policy of the employer to the contrary. Ray v. Broyhill Furn. Indus., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 344 S.E.2d 798 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Strict Construction.
   
   - Sections of this Chapter imposing disqualifications for its benefits should be strictly construed in favor of the claimant and should not be enlarged by implication or by adding to one disqualifying provision words found only in another. In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       Disqualification for benefits under the statute must be strictly construed in favor of the claimant and the employer has the burden to show that the claimant is disqualified from receiving benefits. Barnes v. Singer Co., <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 213</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 756 (1989).

      - At the direction of the Revisor of Statutes, the spelling of the word "moneys" was changed to "monies" everywhere it appears in this section.

     <p>
      The preamble to Session Laws 2011-10, provides: "Whereas, North Carolina's Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund balance had a deficit of $2,500,000,000, as of December 31, 2010, according to the Employment Security Commission; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the State owes the federal government $2,500,000,000 for loan liabilities incurred by the Employment Security Commission to continue unemployment insurance benefits payments to jobless North Carolinians during the current economic crisis; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the total collected by the State in unemployment insurance taxes in the 12-month period ending December 2010 amounted to $955,200,000, while the sum paid in unemployment insurance benefits for the same period totaled $1,900,000,000; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, businesses large and small pay into the unemployment insurance system with the expectation that their contributions will be sufficient to provide assistance to their qualified former jobless employees; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, it is in the best interest of the employers and employees of this State to have the most efficient and cost-effective unemployment insurance tax structure; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, the current unemployment insurance tax structure no longer serves the businesses and citizens of this State in the manner required by these and future economic times; and
     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, major reforms regarding the unemployment insurance tax structure must be developed and implemented as soon as practicable; Now, therefore."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2011-10, ss. 1-4, provide: "1. The General Assembly finds that the State must take swift and prudent action to address the two billion five hundred million dollars ($2,500,000,000) in debt liability for unemployment insurance benefits currently owed to the federal government and the substantial deficit in the North Carolina Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund. To that end, the Department of Commerce shall contract with an independent consulting firm specializing in unemployment insurance and employment security reform to obtain recommendations on what tax structure changes would be fair to the employers of North Carolina and how these revenues, and other financial options, might be used in servicing and liquidating the State's debt and deficits incurred to pay unemployment insurance benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      "2. A contract to obtain services of a consultant pursuant to this act is not subject to Article 3C of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html" target="_blank">Chapter 143</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The consultation contract may be funded from (i) funds available within the Employment Security Commission, including State funds and any federal funds that may be used for the purposes of this act, and (ii) non-State or nongovernmental funds, grants, and in-kind contributions specifically designated for the purpose of carrying out the analysis required by this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      "3. The Department of Commerce shall provide the Fiscal Research Division and the Program Evaluation Division with periodic updates on the progress of the analysis. Within 45 days from the completion of the independent consultant's analysis, the Department of Commerce shall report to the Governor and to the General Assembly on the independent consultant's recommendations for reform of the State's unemployment insurance tax structure.
     </p>
     <p>
      "4. The Employment Security Commission and the Department of Revenue shall cooperate fully with the Department of Commerce, the Fiscal Research Division, and the Program Evaluation Division by giving all information and all data within their possession or ascertainable from their records necessary to carry out the purposes of this act."

     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-2, s. 11, as amended by Session Laws 2013-224, s. 19, provides: "This act becomes effective July 1, 2013. Changes made by this act to unemployment benefits apply to claims for benefits filed on or after June 30, 2013. The requirements of G.S. 96-15(a1) apply to any week of an attached claim filed on or after June 30, 2013.

      Session Laws 2013-224, s. 21, provides: "G.S. 96-4, as amended by S.L. 2011-145, created a Board of Review to determine appeals policies and procedures and to hear appeals arising from the decisions and determinations of the Division of Employment Security. The Board is comprised of three members appointed by the Governor and confirmed by the General Assembly. The Governor is directed to appoint the members of the Board of Review by September 1, 2013. Notwithstanding G.S. 96-4(b), the initial Board of Review appointments made pursuant to this section do not require confirmation by the General Assembly."

       Authority of Chairman of Commission.
   
   - By subsection (a) of this section the chairman of the Employment Security Commission, except as otherwise provided by the Commission, is vested with all authority of the Commission, including authority to conduct hearings and make decisions when the Commission is not in session. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 262</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 890 (1949).

       The decision and order of the chairman, under subsection (a) of this section, are deemed the decision and order of the Commission. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).

       Merits of Labor Disputes.
   
   - The Commission is charged with administering the benefits provided in this Chapter in accordance with the objective standards and criteria set up in the Chapter, but the merits of labor disputes do not belong to the Commission, these being matters properly pertaining to the field of labor relations.

      <p>
       Due Process Rights of Employees.
   
   - To acknowledge that constitutional restraints exist upon a State government in dealing with its employees is not to say that all such employees have a right to due process notice and hearing before they can be removed from their employment. Nantz v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 626, 222 S.E.2d 474, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 473</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 340 (1976).

       Preliminary Injunction.
   
   - Order granting an attorney and her law firm a preliminary injunction compelling the disclosure of unemployment hearings information was vacated because it did not mention the federal regulations concerning the confidentiality of unemployment insurance information and their bearing, if any, on the public records claim; such analysis would be necessary before finding whether the attorney and law firm had a likelihood of success on the merits. Wilson v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 456, 768 S.E.2d 360 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order granting an attorney and her law firm a preliminary injunction compelling the disclosure of unemployment hearings information was vacated and remanded for the trial court to make findings and conclusions addressing the likelihood of success; since the trial court had to enter additional findings and conclusions as to the likelihood of success element, its finding that injunctive relief was necessary to protect the attorney's right to receive hearing notices on a daily basis could change. Wilson v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 456, 768 S.E.2d 360 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order granting an attorney and her law firm a preliminary injunction compelling the disclosure of unemployment hearings information was vacated and remanded because the trial court had to determine whether the amendment to subsection (x) changed the substance of the statute or merely clarified it, and in turn, whether the amendment applied to the claims of the attorney and law firm for the disclosure of hearing notices created prior to the amendment. Wilson v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 456, 768 S.E.2d 360 (2015).

       Whether someone is an "employee" is a mixed question of law and fact.
   
   The question of fact is what the terms, express or implied, of the employment contract are; the question of law is whether those terms show the requisite degree of control. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Faulk, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 363 S.E.2d 225, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 480</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 917 (1988).

       Conclusiveness of Findings of Fact on Review.
   
   - The findings of fact of the Employment Security Commission are conclusive upon review when there is any competent evidence or reasonable inference from such evidence to support them. Graham v. Wall, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 84</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 691 (1941); State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 262</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 890 (1949); State ex rel. Emp.

Hennis Freight Lines, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 496</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 829 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings of fact by the Commission which are supported by competent evidence in the record are conclusive on appeal. Yelverton v. Kemp Furn. Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 275 S.E.2d 553 (1981); State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Faulk, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 363 S.E.2d 225 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not require the Commission to state the reasons for its rulings.
   
   In fact, since the appealing party must state the grounds for its exceptions, the mere overruling of the exceptions provides the parties with the reason for the ruling. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Faulk, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 363 S.E.2d 225 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Jurisdiction of Superior Court.
   
   - The court erred in exercising jurisdiction over the Employment Security Commission pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 4(j)(4), where the commission was never properly served with process, did not consent to personal jurisdiction, and did not voluntarily appear in the case. Croom v. DOC, Div. of Empl. Sec., <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. App.</cite> 493, 547 S.E.2d 87 (2001).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's petition to review an unemployment compensation denial was properly dismissed because (1) G.S. 96-15(h) required the petition's actual delivery, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4, rather than mailing under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 5, as the statute required "certified mail, return receipt requested," emphasizing actual delivery and closely mirroring G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j), and (2) the petition was not delivered. Isenberg v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 772 S.E.2d 97, review denied, 776 S.E.2d 849, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 987 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Scope of Review in Superior Court.
   
   - In appeals from the Employment Security Commission, the reviewing court may determine upon proper exceptions whether the facts found by the Commission were supported by competent evidence and whether the findings so supported sustain the legal conclusions and the award made, but in no event may the reviewing court consider the evidence for the purpose of finding the facts for itself. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Paul's Young Men's Shop, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 231 S.E.2d 157, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 264</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 396 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mandatory provisions in subsection (m) of this section are controlling, and the trial in the superior court on appeal must be subject to the limitation that the decision or determination of the Commission upon such review in the superior court "shall be conclusive and binding as to all questions of fact supported by any competent evidence." State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 4 (1941).
      </p>
      <p>
       When, in a proceeding under this Chapter to determine the liability of a defendant for taxation as an employer, exceptions are taken to the findings of fact made by the Commission in accordance with the procedure prescribed, defendant is not entitled to a trial de novo of the issues raised by his exceptions. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 4 (1941).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When no exceptions are made to findings of fact, they are presumed to be supported by competent evidence
   
   and are binding on appeal. Davis v. Corning Glass Works, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 309 S.E.2d 258 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       If the findings of fact of the Employment Security Commission are insufficient
   
   to enable the court to determine the rights of the parties upon the matters in controversy, the proceeding must be remanded to the end that the Commission make proper findings. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Paul's Young Men's Shop, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 23, 231 S.E.2d 157, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 264</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 396 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of Jury Trial Not Infringed.
   
   - The provision of this section that the Commission's findings of fact in a proceeding before it should be conclusive on appeal when supported by competent evidence is constitutional, and objection thereto on the ground that it deprives a defendant of his right to trial by jury is untenable, since the provision relates to the administrations of a tax law and the machinery for the collection of taxes, and further, since in addition to the remedy of appeal from the decision of the Commission, the statute provides that a defendant may pay the tax under protest and sue for its recovery. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 4 (1941).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal by Commission from Judgment of Superior Court.
   
   - The Commission is not entitled to appeal from a judgment of the superior court that the employer does not come within this Chapter, entered in a proceeding by an employee for compensation; and where the Commission desired to have the liability of an employer for unemployment compensation contribution judicially determined on its contentions that the employer and another concern controlled by the same interests constituted but a single employing unit, it was held that it must follow the procedure prescribed by G.S. 96-10. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 65</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 476, 142 A.L.R. 931 (1941).

To that end, the Department of Commerce shall contract with an independent consulting firm specializing in unemployment insurance and employment security reform to obtain recommendations on what tax structure changes would be fair to the employers of North Carolina and how these revenues, and other financial options, might be used in servicing and liquidating the State's debt and deficits incurred to pay unemployment insurance benefits.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The purpose of this Article is to provide revenue to finance the unemployment benefits allowed under this Chapter and to do so in as simple a manner as possible by imposing a State unemployment tax that is similar to the federal unemployment tax imposed under FUTA. All employers that are liable for the federal unemployment tax on wages paid for services performed in this State and all employers that are required by FUTA to be given a state reimbursement option are liable for a State unemployment tax on wages. Revenue from this tax, referred to as a contribution, is credited to the Unemployment Insurance Fund established in G.S. 96-6.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.2ol1a">
       Required Contribution. - An employer is required to make a contribution in each calendar year to the Unemployment Insurance Fund in an amount equal to the applicable percentage of the taxable wages the employer pays its employees during the year for services performed in this State. An employer may not deduct the contributions due in whole or in part from the remuneration of the individuals employed. Taxable wages are determined in accordance with G.S. 96-9.3. The applicable percentage for an employer is considered the employer's contribution rate and determined in accordance with this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.2ol1b">
       Contribution Rate for Beginning Employer. -  The contribution rate for a beginning employer until the employer's account has been chargeable with benefits for at least 12 calendar months ending July 31 immediately preceding the computation date is one percent (1%). An employer's account has been chargeable with benefits for at least 12 calendar months if the employer has reported wages paid in four completed calendar quarters and its liability extends over all or part of two consecutive calendar years.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.2ol1c">
       Contribution Rate for Experience-Rated Employer. - The contribution rate for an experience-rated employer who does not qualify as a beginning employer under subsection (b) of this section is determined in accordance with the table set out below and then rounded to the nearest one-hundredth percent (0.01%), subject to the minimum and maximum contribution rates. The minimum contribution rate is six-hundredths of one percent (0.06%). The maximum contribution rate is five and seventy-six hundredths percent (5.76%). "Total insured wages" are the total wages reported by all insured employers for the 12-month period ending on June 30 preceding the computation date. The calculations in the table set out below are applied as of September 1 following the computation date. An employer's experience rating is computed as a reserve ratio in accordance with G.S. 96-9.4. An employer's reserve ratio percentage (ERRP) is the employer's reserve ratio multiplied by sixty-eight hundredths. A positive ERRP produces a lower contribution rate, and a negative ERRP produces a higher contribution rate.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.2ol1d">
       Notification of Contribution Rate. - The Division must notify an employer of the employer's contribution rate for a calendar year by January 1 of that year. The contribution rate becomes final unless the employer files an application for review and redetermination prior to May 1 following the effective date of the contribution rate. The Division may redetermine the contribution rate on its own motion within the same time period.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.2ol1e">
       Voluntary Contribution. - An employer that is subject to this section may make a voluntary contribution to the Unemployment Insurance Fund in addition to its required contribution. A voluntary contribution is credited to the employer's account. A voluntary contribution made by an employer within 30 days after the date on an annual notice of its contribution rate is considered to have been made as of the previous July 31.

       Effect of Reinstatement of Liability After Prior Exemption.
   
   - Where an employer, otherwise subject to the provisions of this Chapter, is exempted from those provisions by legislative action and by legislative action that exemption is subsequently terminated, and additionally, where there have been no changes in the circumstances or activities of the employer, upon reinstatement of liability under this Chapter that employer is entitled to credit for its prior account balance, and that employer's contribution rate should be determined primarily by reference to its former experience rating at the time of its exemption. The burden will be upon the Commission to show what, if any, changes in circumstances have come about which would justify an upward revision of that employer's rate of contribution. State ex rel.

       Contributions Constitute a Tax.
   
   - Contributions imposed on employers within the purview of this Chapter are compulsory and therefore constitute a tax, and they are not rendered any less a tax by reason of the provision that they should be segregated in a special fund for distribution in furtherance of the purpose of the Chapter.

       A State bank which is a member of the federal reserve system is not exempt
   
   from taxation under this Chapter because of its connection with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation nor may it claim such exemption because the tax would discriminate against it in favor of national member banks, since to relieve it from such taxation would discriminate in favor of it against nonmember State banks.

   - An action to determine whether salaries paid certain employees should be included in computing the contributions to be paid by an employer under the Unemployment Compensation Act involves solely an issue of fact and does not involve any right, status or legal relation, and the employer may not maintain proceedings under the Declaratory Judgment Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-253" target="_blank">G.S. 1-253</a></cite> et seq., to determine the question.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1a">
       Applicability. - This section applies to a governmental entity, a nonprofit organization, and an Indian tribe that is required by section 3309 of the Code to have a reimbursement option. Each of these employers must finance benefits under the contributions method imposed under G.S. 96-9.2 unless the employer elects to finance benefits by making reimbursable payments to the Division for the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1b">
       Election. - An employer may make an election under this section by filing a written notice of its election with the Division at least 30 days before the January 1 effective date of the election. An Indian tribe may make separate elections for itself and each subdivision, subsidiary, or business enterprise wholly owned by the tribe. A new employer may make an election under this section by filing a written notice of its election within 30 days after the employer receives notification from the Division that it is eligible to make an election under this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1c">
       Reimbursable Amount. - An employer must reimburse the Unemployment Insurance Fund for the amount of benefits that are paid to an individual for weeks of unemployment that begin within a benefit year established during the effective period of the employer's election and are attributable to service that is covered by section 3309 of the Code and was performed in the employ of the employer. For regular benefits, the reimbursable amount is the amount of regular benefits paid. For extended benefits, the reimbursable amount is the amount not reimbursed by the federal government.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1d">
       Account. - The Division must establish a separate account for each reimbursing employer. The Division must credit payments made by the employer to the account. The Division must charge to the account benefits that are paid by the Unemployment Insurance Fund to individuals for weeks of unemployment that begin within a benefit year established during the effective period of the election and are attributable to service in the employ of the employer. All benefits paid must be charged to the employer's account except benefits paid through error.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1e">
       Annual Reconciliation. - A reimbursing employer must maintain an account balance equal to one percent (1%) of its taxable wages. The Division must determine the balance of each employer's account on the computation date. If there is a deficit in the account, the Division must bill the employer for the amount necessary to bring its account to one percent (1%) of its taxable wages for the immediate four quarters preceding July 1. Except as provided in subsection (j) of this section, any amount in the account in excess of the one percent (1%) of taxable wages will be retained in the employer's account as a credit and will not be refunded to the employer. The Division must send a bill as soon as practical. Payment is due within 30 days from the date a bill is mailed. Amounts unpaid by the due date accrue interest and penalties in the same manner as past-due contributions and are subject to the same collection remedies provided under G.S. 96-10 for past-due contributions.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1f">
       Quarterly Wage Reports. - A reimbursing employer must submit quarterly wage reports to the Division on or before the last day of the month following the close of the calendar quarter in which the wages are paid. During the first four quarters following an election to be a reimbursing employer, the employer must submit an advance payment with its quarterly report. The amount of the advance payment is equal to one percent (1%) of the taxable wages reported on the quarterly wage report. The Division must remit the payments to the Unemployment Insurance Fund and credit the payments to the employer's account.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1g">
       Change in Election. - The Division must close the account of an employer that has been paying contributions under G.S. 96-9.2 and that elects to change to a reimbursement basis under this section. A closed account may not be used in any future computation of a contribution rate. The Division must close the account of an employer that terminates its election to reimburse the Unemployment Insurance Fund in lieu of making contributions. An employer that terminates its election under this section is subject to the standard beginning rate.

        <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1h1">
         An employer that fails to pay an amount due within 90 days after receiving a bill and has not paid this liability as of the computation date loses the option to make reimbursable payments in lieu of contributions for the following calendar year. An employer that loses the option to make reimbursable payments in lieu of contributions for a calendar year regains that option for the following calendar year if it pays its outstanding liability and makes all contributions during the year for which the option was lost.

         Services performed for an employer that fails to make payments, including interest and penalties, required under this section after all collection activities considered necessary by the Division have been exhausted, are no longer treated as "employment" for the purpose of coverage under this Chapter. An employer that has lost coverage regains coverage under this Chapter for services performed if the Division determines that all contributions, payments in lieu of contributions, penalties, and interest have been paid. The Division must notify the Internal Revenue Service and the United States Department of Labor of any termination or reinstatement of coverage pursuant to this subsection.

       Refund. - If a reimbursing employer erroneously remits an amount in excess of the amount due, the employer may apply to the Division for a refund of the excess amount remitted within the time limits in this subsection. The Division must determine that the requested refund was in excess of the amount due and was erroneously paid. The Division must refund, without interest, the excess amount but in no event will the refund result in an account balance less than one percent (1%) of the reimbursing employer's taxable wages. The refund application must be filed by the later of the following:
       <ol>
        <li id="t96a02s96-9.6ol1j1">
         Five years from the last day of the calendar year with respect to which a payment was made.

         One year from the date on which such payment was made.

       </ol>
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      An election is valid for a minimum of four years and is binding until the employer files a notice terminating its election. An employer must file a written notice of termination with the Division at least 30 days before the January 1 effective date of the termination. The Division must notify an employer of a determination of the effective date of an election the employer makes and of any termination of the election. These determinations are subject to reconsideration, appeal, and review. An employer that makes the election allowed by this section may not deduct any amount due under this section from the remuneration of the individuals it employs.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Division must furnish an employer with a statement of all credits and charges made to its account as of the computation date prior to January 1 of the succeeding year. The Division may, in its sole discretion, provide a reimbursing employer with informational bills or lists of charges on a basis more frequent than yearly if the Division finds it is in the best interest of the Division and the affected employer to do so.

       Employer Remains Covered Until Coverage Is Terminated as Provided by This Section.

       Effect of Reinstatement of Liability After Prior Exemption.
   
   - Where an employer, otherwise subject to the provisions of this Chapter, is exempted from those provisions by legislative action and by legislative action that exemption is subsequently terminated, and additionally, where there have been no changes in the circumstances or activities of the employer, upon reinstatement of liability under this Chapter that employer is entitled to credit for its prior account balance, and that employer's contribution rate should be determined primarily by reference to its former experience rating at the time of its exemption. The burden will be upon the Commission to show what, if any, changes in circumstances have come about which would justify an upward revision of that employer's rate of contribution. State ex rel.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t96a2As96-9.15ol1a">
       Report and Payment. - Contributions are payable to the Division when a report is due. A report is due on or before the last day of the month following the close of the calendar quarter in which the wages are paid. The Division must remit the contributions to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. If the amount of the contributions shown to be due after all credits is less than five dollars ($5.00), no payment need be made.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2As96-9.15ol1b">
       Overpayment. - If an employer remits an amount in excess of the amount of contributions due, including any applicable penalty and interest, the excess amount remitted is considered an overpayment. The Division must refund an overpayment unless the amount of the overpayment is less than five dollars ($5.00). Overpayments of less than five dollars ($5.00) may be refunded only upon receipt of a written demand for the refund from the employer within the time allowed under G.S. 96-10(e).
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2As96-9.15ol1c">
       Method of Payment. - An employer may pay contributions by electronic funds transfer. When an electronic funds transfer cannot be completed due to insufficient funds or the nonexistence of an account of the transferor, the Division may assess a penalty equal to ten percent (10%) of the amount of the transfer, subject to a minimum of one dollar ($1.00) and a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000). The Division may waive this penalty for good cause shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2As96-9.15ol1d">
       Form of Report. - An employer must complete the tax form prescribed by the Division. An employer or an agent of an employer that reports wages for at least 10 employees must file the portion of the "Employer's Quarterly Tax and Wage Report" that contains the name, social security number, and gross wages of each employee in an electronic format prescribed by the Division. For failure of an employer to comply with this subsection, the Division must assess a penalty of twenty-five dollars ($25.00). For failure of an agent of an employer to comply with this subsection, the Division may deny the agent the right to report wages and file reports for that employer for a period of one year following the calendar quarter in which the agent filed the improper report. The Division may reduce or waive a penalty for good cause shown.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2As96-9.15ol1e">
       Jeopardy Assessment. - The Secretary may immediately assess and collect a contribution the Secretary finds is due from an employer if the Secretary determines that collection of the tax is in jeopardy and immediate assessment and collection are necessary in order to protect the interest of the State and the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2As96-9.15ol1f">
       Domestic Employer Exception. - The Division may authorize an employer of domestic service employees to file an annual report and to file that report by telephone. An annual report allowed under this subsection is due on or before the last day of the month following the close of the calendar year in which the wages are paid. A domestic service employer that files a report by telephone must contact either the tax auditor assigned to the employer's account or the Division of Employment Security in Raleigh and report the required information to that auditor or to that section by the date the report is due.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The Division may allow an employer to pay contributions by credit card. An employer that pays by credit card must include an amount equal to any fee charged by the Division for the use of the card. A payment of taxes that is made by credit card and is not honored by the card issuer does not relieve the employer of the obligation to pay the taxes.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer that does not pay by electronic funds transfer or by credit card must pay by check or cash. A check must be drawn on a United States bank and cash must be in currency of the United States.

         If, after due notice, any employer defaults in any payment of contributions or interest thereon, the amount due shall be collected by civil action in the name of the Division, and the employer adjudged in default shall pay the costs of such action. Civil actions brought under this section to collect contributions or interest thereon from an employer shall be heard by the court at the earliest possible date, and shall be entitled to preference upon the calendar of the court over all other civil actions, except petitions for judicial review under this Chapter and cases arising under the Workers' Compensation Law of this State; or, if any contribution imposed by this Chapter, or any portion thereof, and/or penalties duly provided for the nonpayment thereof shall not be paid within 30 days after the same become due and payable, and after due notice and reasonable opportunity for hearing, the Division, under the hand of the Assistant Secretary, may certify the same to the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the delinquent resides or has property, and additional copies of said certificate for each county in which the Division has reason to believe the delinquent has property located. If the amount of a delinquency is less than fifty dollars ($50.00), the Division may not certify the amount to the clerk of court until a field tax auditor or another representative of the Division personally contacts, or unsuccessfully attempts to personally contact, the delinquent and collect the amount due. A certificate or a copy of a certificate forwarded to the clerk of the superior court shall immediately be docketed and indexed on the cross index of judgments, and from the date of such docketing shall constitute a preferred lien upon any property which said delinquent may own in said county, with the same force and effect as a judgment rendered by the superior court. The Division shall forward a copy of said certificate to the sheriff or sheriffs of such county or counties, or to a duly authorized agent of the Division, and when so forwarded and in the hands of such sheriff or agent of the Division, shall have all the force and effect of an execution issued to such sheriff or agent of the Division by the clerk of the superior court upon a judgment of the superior court duly docketed in said county. Provided, however, the Division may in its discretion withhold the issuance of said certificate or execution to the sheriff or agent of the Division for a period not exceeding 180 days from the date upon which the original certificate is certified to the clerk of superior court. The Division is further authorized and empowered to issue alias copies of said certificate or execution to the sheriff or sheriffs of such county or counties, or to a duly authorized agent of the Division in all cases in which the sheriff or duly authorized agent has returned an execution or certificate unsatisfied; when so issued and in the hands of the sheriff or duly authorized agent of the Division, such alias shall have all the force and effect of an alias execution issued to such sheriff or duly authorized agent of the Division by the clerk of the superior court upon a judgment of the superior court duly docketed in said county. Provided, however, that notwithstanding any provision of this subsection, upon filing one written notice with the Division, the sheriff of any county shall have the sole and exclusive right to serve all executions and make all collections mentioned in this subsection and in such case no agent of the Division shall have the authority to serve any executions or make any collections therein in such county. A return of such execution, or alias execution, shall be made to the Division, together with all moneys collected thereunder, and when such order, execution, or alias is referred to the agent of the Division for service the said agent of the Division shall be vested with all the powers of the sheriff to the extent of serving such order, execution or alias and levying or collecting thereunder. The agent of the Division to whom such order or execution is referred shall give a bond not to exceed three thousand dollars ($3,000) approved by the Division for the faithful performance of such duties. The liability of said agent shall be in the same manner and to the same extent as is now imposed on sheriffs in the service of executions. If any sheriff of this State or any agent of the Division who is charged with the duty of serving executions shall willfully fail, refuse, or neglect to execute any order directed to him by the said Division and within the time provided by law, the official bond of such sheriff or of such agent of the Division shall be liable for the contributions, penalty, interest, and costs due by the employer. Any judgment that is executable and allowed under this section shall be subject to attachment and garnishment under G.S. 1-359(b) in payment of unpaid taxes that are due from the employer and collectable under this Article.

Any such information obtained by an agent or employee of the Division shall not be divulged, published, or open to public inspection other than to the Division's employees in the performance of their public duties. Any employee of the Division who violates any provision of this section shall be fined not less than twenty dollars ($20.00), nor more than two hundred dollars ($200.00), or imprisoned for not longer than 90 days, or both.

The cancellation shall have the full force and effect of a cancellation entered by an attorney of record for the Division. It shall also be the duty of such clerk, when any such certificate is furnished him by the Division showing that a judgment has been paid in part, to make a notation on the margin of the judgment docket showing the amount of such payment so certified and to file said certificate. This paragraph shall apply to judgments already docketed, as well as to the future judgments docketed by the Division. For the filing of said statement or certificate and making new notations on the record, the clerk of superior court shall be paid a fee of fifty cents (50›) by the Division.

For like cause and within the same period, adjustment or refund may be so made on the Division's own initiative. Provided further, that nothing in this section or in any other section of this Chapter shall be construed as permitting the refund of moneys due and payable under the law and regulations in effect at the time such moneys were paid. In any case, where the Division finds that any employing unit has erroneously paid to this State contributions or interest upon wages earned by individuals in employment in another state, refund or adjustment thereof shall be made, without interest, irrespective of any other provisions of this subsection, upon satisfactory proof to the Division that such other state has determined the employing unit liable under its law for such contributions or interest.

Whenever any employer, person, firm or corporation against whom taxes or contributions provided for in this Chapter have been assessed, shall claim to have a valid defense to the enforcement of the tax or contribution so assessed or charged, such employer, person, firm or corporation shall pay the tax or contribution so assessed to the Division; but if at the time of such payment he shall notify the Division in writing that the same is paid under protest, such payment shall be without prejudice to any defenses or rights he may have in the premises, and he may, at any time within 30 days after such payment, demand the same in writing from the Division; and if the same shall not be refunded within 90 days thereafter, he may sue the Division for the amount so demanded; such suit against the Division must be brought in the Superior Court of Wake County, or in the county in which the taxpayer resides, or in the county where the taxpayer conducts his principal place of business; and if, upon the trial it shall be determined that such tax or contribution or any part thereof was for any reason invalid, excessive or contrary to the provisions of this Chapter, the amount paid shall be refunded by the Division accordingly. The remedy provided by this subsection shall be deemed to be cumulative and in addition to such other remedies as are provided by other subsections of this Chapter. No suit, action or proceeding for refund or to recover contributions or payroll taxes paid under protest according to the provisions of this subsection shall be maintained unless such suit, action or proceeding is commenced within one year after the expiration of the 90 days mentioned in this subsection, or within one year from the date of the refusal of the Division to make refund should such refusal be made before the expiration of said 90 days above mentioned.

       This Chapter provides remedies for an employer
   
   who claims a valid defense to the enforcement of the tax or to the collection of the contributions assessed. In addition to right of appeal from the decision of the Commission, it is provided that he may pay the tax under protest and sue for its recovery. The remedy provided by this section must be pursued in the manner therein prescribed. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M.

       Right to Raise Question of Constitutionality.
   
   - In an action by the Employment Security Commission to determine liability of defendant for contributions under the act, the defendant may not raise the question of the constitutionality of the statute under which the Commission levied the assessment in question, it being required in order to raise this defense that he pay the contributions under protest and sue for recovery.

       Judgment That Certain Salaries Should Not Be Included Cannot Be Obtained.
   
   - A judgment that salaries paid to certain of plaintiff 's employees should not be included in computing the amount of the contributions plaintiff should pay under this Chapter would in effect enjoin the Commission from seeking further to collect the amount of contributions which it contends are justly due, and it being expressly provided that injunction shall not lie to restrain the collection of any tax or contribution levied under the Chapter, the court is without jurisdiction of an action seeking such relief, since it may not do indirectly what it is prohibited from doing directly.

   the limitation it imposes is addressed to the power of the Commission to make a refund and the conditions upon which it may be made rather than to any limitation upon an action for the recovery of money. It is broad enough in its phraseology to cover refund of money paid through mistake, without raising technical distinctions between voluntary and involuntary payments. B-C Remedy Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 52</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 733, 163 A.L.R. 773 (1946).

      <p>
       Retroactive Extension of Time for Applying for Refunds.
   
   - While the limitation on the authority of the Commission to make refunds is fatal to a claim, so long as the limitation lasts, a change of law, enlarging time in which refunds may be applied for or made, does not involve any constitutional inhibitions such as apply to ordinary statutes of limitation, and the legislature has the power to apply the extended time retroactively. B-C Remedy Co. v. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 52</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 733, 163 A.L.R. 773 (1946), so holding as to the 1943 amendment of subsection (e).

         The employer is insolvent and the Secretary probably could not otherwise collect an amount equal to, or in excess of, the amount offered in compromise. An employer is considered insolvent only in one of the following circumstances:

       Refund of Contributions Credited to Wrong Account. - When contributions are credited to the wrong account, the erroneous credit may be adjusted only by refunding the employer who made the payment that was credited in error. This applies regardless of whether the employer to whom the payment was credited in error is a related entity of the employer to whom the payment should have been credited. An employer whose payment is credited to the wrong account may request a refund of the amount erroneously credited by filing a request for refund within five years of the last day of the calendar year in which the erroneous credit occurred.

      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.5ol1b">
       Effect on Contribution Rate. - Failure of the Division to credit the correct account for contributions does not affect the contribution rate determined under G.S. 96-9.2 for either the employer whose account should have been credited for the contributions or the employer whose account was credited, and it does not affect the liability of an employer for contributions determined under those rates. No prior contribution rate for either of the employers may be adjusted even though the contribution rates were based on incorrect amounts in their account. An employer is liable for contributions determined under those rates for the five calendar years preceding the year in which the error is determined. This applies regardless of whether the employer acted in good faith.

      The Division must determine the ratio of the credit balance in each employer's account to the total of the credit balances in all employers' accounts as of the computation date. The Division must allocate an amount equal to the interest credited to this State's account in the Unemployment Trust Fund for the four completed calendar quarters preceding the computation date on a pro rata basis to these accounts. The amount must be prorated to an employer's account in the same ratio that the credit balance in the employer's account bears to the total of the credit balances in all the accounts. Voluntary contributions made by an employer after July 31 of a year are not considered a part of the employer's account balance used in determining the allocation under this section until the computation date in the following year.

      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1a">
       Acquisition of a Business. - When an employer acquires all of the business of another employer, the account of the predecessor must be transferred as of the date of the acquisition to the successor for use in the determination of the successor's contribution rate. This subsection does not apply when there is no common ownership between the predecessor and the successor and the successor acquired the assets of the predecessor in a sale in bankruptcy.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1b">
       Acquisition of Portion of a Business. - When a distinct and severable portion of an employer's business is transferred to a successor employer and the successor employer continues to operate the acquired business, the portion of the account attributable to the transferred business may, with the approval of the Division, be transferred by mutual consent to the successor employer as of the date of the transfer. A successor employer that is a related entity of the transferring employer is eligible for a transfer from the transferring employer's account only to the extent permitted by rules adopted by the Division. No transfer may be made to the account of an employer that has ceased to be an employer under G.S. 96-11.9.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1c">
       Acquisition by Related Party. - If an employer transfers its business, or a portion thereof, to another person and, at the time of the transfer, there is substantially common ownership, management, or control of the predecessor employer and the transferee, then the portion of the account attributable to the transferred business must be transferred to the transferee as of the date of the transfer for use in the determination of the transferee's contribution rate.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1-c1">
       Acquisition to Obtain Lower Contribution Rate. - The account of the predecessor employer will not be transferred if the Division finds that a person formed or acquired the business solely or primarily for the purpose of obtaining a lower contribution rate.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1d">
       Contribution Rate. - If the effective date of a transfer of an account under this section is after the computation date in a calendar year, the Division must recalculate the contribution rate for the predecessor employer and the successor employer based on their account balances on the effective date of the account transfer.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1e">
       Liability for Contributions. - An employer that, by operation of law, purchase, or otherwise is the successor to an employer liable for contributions becomes liable for contributions on the day of the succession. This subsection does not affect the successor's liability as otherwise prescribed by law for unpaid contributions due from the predecessor.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1f">
       Deceased or Insolvent Employer. - When the business of a deceased person or of an insolvent debtor is taken over and operated by an administrator, executor, receiver, or trustee in bankruptcy, the new employer automatically succeeds to the account and contribution rate of the deceased person or insolvent debtor without the necessity of filing an application for the transfer of the account.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Bs96-11.7ol1g">
       Continuation of Existing Account. - Any transferee subject to a complete transfer of account under this section must not request or maintain an account with the Division other than the account of the existing business. If a transferee receives a new account and the Division subsequently finds that the transferee is subject to a complete transfer of account under this section, the Division must recalculate the annual tax rates based on the combined annual account balances of the new employer and the existing business.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      If a transfer of part or all of an account is allowed under this subsection, the successor employer requesting the transfer may make a request for transfer by filing an application for transfer with the Division within two years after the date the business was transferred.
     </p>
     <p>
      Substantially common ownership, management, or control exists if one or more persons, entities, or other organizations owning, managing, or controlling the business maintain substantial ownership, management, or control of the transferee. Control may occur by means of ownership of the organization conducting the business, ownership of assets necessary to conduct the business, security arrangements or lease arrangements covering assets necessary to conduct the business, or a contract when the ownership, stated arrangements, or contract provide for or allow direction of the internal affairs or conduct of the business. Control is not affected by changes in the form of a business, reorganization of a business, or expansion of a business.

   - Where an employer, otherwise subject to the provisions of this Chapter, is exempted from those provisions by legislative action and by legislative action that exemption is subsequently terminated, and additionally, where there have been no changes in the circumstances or activities of the employer, upon reinstatement of liability under this Chapter that employer is entitled to credit for its prior account balance, and that employer's contribution rate should be determined primarily by reference to its former experience rating at the time of its exemption. The burden will be upon the Commission to show what, if any, changes in circumstances have come about which would justify an upward revision of that employer's rate of contribution. State ex rel.

       § 96-14.1. Unemployment benefits.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1a">
       Purpose. - The purpose of this Article is to provide temporary unemployment benefits as required by federal law to an individual who is unemployed through no fault on the part of the individual and who is able, available, and actively seeking work. Benefits are payable on the basis of service, to which section 3309(a)(1) of the Code applies, performed for a governmental entity, a nonprofit organization, and an Indian tribe in the same amount, on the same terms, and subject to the same conditions as compensation payable on the basis of other service.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1b">
       Valid Claim. - To obtain benefits, an individual must file a valid claim for unemployment benefits, register for work, and have a weekly benefit amount calculated pursuant to G.S. 96-14.2(a) that equals or exceeds fifteen dollars ($15.00). An individual must serve a one-week waiting period for each claim filed, except no waiting period applies under this subsection to a claim for unemployment due directly to a disaster covered by a federal disaster declaration. A valid claim is one that meets the employment and wage standards in this subsection for the individual's base period. A valid claim for a second benefit year is one that meets the employment and wage standards in this subsection since the beginning date of the prior benefit year and before the date the new benefit claim is filed:
       <ol>
        <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1b1">
         Employment. - The individual has been paid wages in at least two quarters of the individual's base period.
        </li>
        <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1b2">
         Wages. - The individual has been paid wages totaling at least six times the average weekly insured wage during the individual's base period. If an individual lacks sufficient base period wages, then the wage standard for that individual is determined using the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the first day of the individual's benefit year. This alternative base period may not be used by an individual in making a claim for benefits in the next benefit year.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1c">
       Qualification Determination. - An individual's qualification for benefits is determined based on the reason for separation from employment from the individual's bona fide employer. The individual's bona fide employer is the most recent employer for whom the individual began employment for an indefinite duration or a duration of more than 30 consecutive calendar days, regardless of whether work was performed on all of those days. An individual who is disqualified has no right to benefits. An individual who is disqualified may have the disqualification removed if the individual files a valid claim based on employment with a bona fide employer that employed the individual subsequent to the employment that resulted in disqualification. An individual who had a prior disqualification removed may be determined to be disqualified based on the reason for separation from employment from the individual's most recent bona fide employer, and the individual must be otherwise eligible for benefits.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1d">
       Eligibility for Benefits. - The Division must calculate a weekly benefit amount and determine the duration of benefits for an individual who files a valid claim and qualifies for benefits. To receive the weekly benefit amount, the Division must find that the individual meets the work search eligibility requirements for each week of the benefit period. An individual who fails to meet the work search requirements for a given week is ineligible to receive a benefit until the condition causing the ineligibility ceases to exist.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1e">
       Federal Restrictions. - Benefits are not payable for services performed by the following individuals, to the maximum extent allowed by section 3304 of the Code:
       <ol>
        <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.1ol1e1">
         Instructional, research, or principal administrative employees of educational institutions.

         Individuals who performed services described in either subdivision (1) or (2) of this subsection in an educational institution while in the employ of an educational service agency. The term "educational service agency" has the same meaning as defined in section 3304 of the Code.

     </h3>
     <ol type="a">
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.2ol1a">
       Weekly Benefit Amount. - The weekly benefit amount for an individual who is totally unemployed is an amount equal to the wages paid to the individual in the last two completed quarters of the individual's base period divided by 52 and rounded to the next lower whole dollar. If this amount is less than fifteen dollars ($15.00), the individual is not eligible for benefits. The weekly benefit amount may not exceed three hundred fifty dollars ($350.00).
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.2ol1b">
       Partial Weekly Benefit Amount. - The weekly benefit amount for an individual who is partially unemployed or part-totally employed is the amount the individual would receive under subsection (a) of this section if the individual were totally unemployed, reduced by the amount of any wages earned by the individual in the benefit week in excess of twenty percent (20%) of the benefit amount applicable to total unemployment. If the amount so calculated is not a whole dollar, the amount must be rounded to the next lower whole dollar. Payments received by an individual under a supplemental benefit plan do not affect the computation of the individual's partial weekly benefit.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.2ol1c">
       Retirement Reduction. - The amount of benefits payable to an individual must be reduced as provided in section 3304(a)(15) of the Code. This subsection does not apply to social security retirement benefits.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.2ol1d">
       Income Tax Withholding. - An individual may elect to have federal income tax deducted and withheld from the individual's unemployment benefits in the amount specified in section 3402 of the Code. An individual may elect to have State income tax deducted and withheld from the individual's unemployment benefits in an amount determined by the individual. The individual may change a previously elected withholding status. The amounts deducted and withheld from unemployment benefits remain in the Unemployment Insurance Fund until transferred to the appropriate taxing authority as a payment of income tax. The Division must advise an individual in writing at the time the individual files a claim for unemployment benefits that the benefits paid are subject to federal and State income tax, that requirements exist pertaining to estimated tax payments, and that the individual may elect to have the amounts withheld.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Cs96-14.2ol1e">
       COVID-19 Increased Benefit Amount. - The weekly benefit amount calculated under this section shall be increased by fifty dollars ($50.00). The increased benefit amount is payable for weeks beginning on or after September 5, 2020. The increased benefit amount expires and will not be paid for weeks (i) beginning on or after December 26, 2020, or (ii) immediately following the week that fully expends the amount allocated by the General Assembly for this purpose under Section 3.3(75) of S.L. 2020-4, as amended by House Bill 1105, 2019 Regular Session, whichever occurs first.

      - Session Laws 2013-2, s. 11, as amended by Session Laws 2013-224, s. 19, provides: "This act becomes effective July 1, 2013. Changes made by this act to unemployment benefits apply to claims for benefits filed on or after June 30, 2013. The requirements of G.S. 96-15(a1) apply to any week of an attached claim filed on or after June 30, 2013. Changes made by this act to require an account balance by an employer that is a governmental entity or a nonprofit organization and that elects to finance benefits by making reimbursable payments in lieu of contributions apply to advance payments payable for calendar quarters beginning on or after July 1, 2013. Changes made by this act to the determination and application of the contribution rate apply to contributions payable for calendar quarters beginning on or after January 1, 2014."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-391, s. 9, provides in part: "Changes made by this act to unemployment benefits apply to claims for benefits filed on or after June 30, 2013.

      Session Laws 2021-5, s. 3, provided: "G.S. 96-14(b) reads as rewritten" and substituted "any wages earned by the individual" for "any wages the individual receives." However, G.S. 96-14 is a repealed section, and therefore has no subsection (b). The apparent intent of the act was to amend subsection (b) of G.S. 96-14.2. Subsequently, Session Laws 2021-16, s. 2.1, amended the introductory language of Session Laws 2021-5, s. 3, so that it now reads: 'G.S. 96-14.2(b) reads as rewritten' and the amendment has been implemented in subsection (b) of this section.

        Policy.
   
   - The General Assembly has stated the policy of this State is that the compulsory reserves required under the Employment Security Law be used for the benefit of persons unemployed through no fault of their own. In order to carry out the intent of the act, its provisions should be liberally construed in favor of applicants. By contrast, our courts have said that sections of the act imposing disqualifications for its benefits should be strictly construed in favor of the claimant and should not be enlarged by implication. Couch v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 366 S.E.2d 574, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 472</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 440 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction.
   
   - Sections of this Chapter imposing disqualifications for its benefits should be strictly construed in favor of the claimant and should not be enlarged by implication or by adding to one disqualifying provision words found only in another. In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968); In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Employment Security Act was designed to provide protection against economic insecurity due to unemployment and should be liberally construed in favor of applicants. Eason v. Gould, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 311 S.E.2d 372 (1984), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 618</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 223 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The disqualifying provisions of this section must be strictly construed, since the main purpose of the law is to benefit eligible workers. The section must be construed to authorize benefits to one who becomes involuntarily unemployed, who is physically able to work, who is available for work at suitable employment and who, though actively seeking such employment, cannot find it through no fault of his own. Wright v. Bus Term. Restaurant, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. App.</cite> 395, 322 S.E.2d 201 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The disqualification rules must be applied strictly in favor of the claimant. This rule stems from the legislative policy behind the Employment Security Law, conceived during the Great Depression of the 1930's, to provide support for persons who are able and willing to work, but who have become unemployed because of conditions of their former employment, and who continue to be unemployed because of generally depressed labor market conditions in their community. The meaning of this rule of construction and the policy behind it is that where a statutory term is vague, and the claimant is arguably covered, the claimant should be given the benefit of the doubt. Bunn v. North Carolina State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 321 S.E.2d 32 (1984), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 173</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 31 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of the Act which impose disqualifications for its benefits must be strictly construed in favor of the claimant. Poteat v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 138, 345 S.E.2d 238 (1986), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 201</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 219 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        G.S. 96-14(1) (now repealed) was not applicable to a former employee's case because that section applied to cases in which an employee terminated an employment relationship and then sought unemployment benefits. However, the employee's employment was terminated by the employer; therefore, the controlling statute was G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed). James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior court did not err in affirming the decision of the Employment Security Commission (ESC) that an employee left work with good cause attributable to the employer because the employee met his burden of showing that his acceptance of a voluntary early retirement package was valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work and that such acceptance was a result of the employer's actions; case law was favorable toward applicants for unemployment benefits under the Employment Security Act, G.S. 96-1 et seq., and the ESC's unchallenged findings of fact were liberally in favor of the employee. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 665 S.E.2d 141 (2008).

       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of This Section Prevail over General Policy of G.S.
   
   96-2. - A specific ground for disqualifying an employee from unemployment benefits in this section, "when applicable," prevails over the general policy in G.S. 96-2 of providing benefits to workers who are "unemployed through no fault of their own." Lynch v. PPG Indus., <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 412 S.E.2d 163 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disqualification statutes are to be strictly construed in favor of claimant,
   
   with the employer having the burden of proving that the claimant is disqualified. McGaha v. Nancy's Styling Salon, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 368 S.E.2d 49, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 174</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 110 (1988).

        The Employment Security Law is designed to provide for the general welfare of North Carolina citizens. Bunn v. North Carolina State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 321 S.E.2d 32 (1984), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">313 N.C. 173</cite>, 326 S.E.2d 31 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The Employment Security Act was not designed to provide the payment of benefits to a person who is physically unable to work
   
   or who, for any other personal reason, would at no time be in a position to accept any employment if it were tendered to him, however capable and industrious such person may be. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This Act does not contemplate penalizing workers who choose in favor of their own health,
   
   safety or ethical standards and against an affirmative or de facto policy of the employer to the contrary. Ray v. Broyhill Furn. Indus., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 344 S.E.2d 798 (1986).

       <p>
        As to a person who must quit a job for health reasons
   
   but who is available for other employment, both reason and justice demand that such a claimant receive unemployment benefits. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).

       <p>
        Disqualification for Benefits Under This Section.
   
   - Under this section, as amended effective July 1, 1985, a claimant may be disqualified for unemployment benefits, not only for the period of time
   prior to a scheduled separation, but also for that period of time after the date of a scheduled separation, unless the claimant proves that it was impracticable or unduly burdensome for the individual to work until the announced separation date. If the claimant proves this to the satisfaction of the Commission, the claimant is entitled to full benefits, with only a limited period of disqualification as provided in the closing provisions of subdivision (1). Seaberry v. W.T. Bridgers Contract Labor, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 372 S.E.2d 348 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section prevails over the provision of G.S.
   
   96-2 stating the general policy of the statute to provide for benefits to workers who are "unemployed through no fault of their own." In re Steelman, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R. 929 (1941); In re Usery, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C.

        Section Construed with G.S. 96-13.
   
   - This section and G.S. 96-13 as cognate statutes provide the overall formula governing the right to unemployment compensation benefits. Being thus in pari materia, they are to be construed together.

        Burden of Proof.
   
   - Each claimant is required to show to the satisfaction of the Commission that he is not disqualified for benefits under this section. In re Steelman, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R. 929 (1941); State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 381</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 403 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The claimant has the burden of proving that he is not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Huggins v. Precision Concrete Forming, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 571, 320 S.E.2d 416 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily a claimant is presumed to be entitled to benefits under the Unemployment Compensation Act, but this is a rebuttable presumption, with the burden on the employer to show circumstances which disqualify the claimant, noting that the employer did not except to or attack the statement of the Commission in its decision that the employer had the responsibility to show that a claimant for benefits was discharged for misconduct within the meaning of the law. Intercraft Indus. Corp. v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 373</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 357 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden is on the employer to show circumstances which disqualify the claimant. Umstead v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 331 S.E.2d 218, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 675</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 405, 337 S.E.2d 853 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        A discharged employee is presumed to be entitled to unemployment compensation benefits and the employer has the burden of rebutting the presumption by proving disqualification, and taking additional evidence upon remand would allow employers repeated opportunities to meet their burden of proving that an employee should be disqualified. Dunlap v. Clarke Checks, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 375 S.E.2d 171 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily a claimant is presumed to be entitled to benefits under the Unemployment Compensation Act; the employer bears the burden of rebutting this presumption by showing circumstances which disqualify the claimant. Williams v. Davie County, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 461 S.E.2d 25 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Filing Prematurely.
   
   - While subdivision (1) of this section sets "the time such claim is filed" as determinative in assessing disqualification thereunder, the fact that a claim was filed during the four-day period during which employee could have continued to work for employer and thus was disqualified would not function to deny him benefits after that four-day period, when he was involuntarily unemployed through no fault of his own. Poteat v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 201</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 219 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits.
   
   - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina, there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow v. Holland Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 695, 308 S.E.2d 335 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 308</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 651 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unemployment Compensation Insurance Benefits Not Reduced by Amount of Pension Benefits Received.
   
   - Superior court did not err in affirming the decision of the Employment Security Commission (ESC) that an employee's benefits would not be reduced by the amount of pension benefits received under the Employment Security Act, G.S. 96-12(f) (now repealed) and G.S. 96-14(9) (now repealed), because the employee did not "receive" his lump sum that he had rolled over from the employer directly into an Individual Retirement Account; deference was given to the Federal Employment and Training Administration's treatment of lump sum rollover distributions with regard to reductions in unemployment compensation insurance benefits, and the Administration stated that if a rollover from a qualified trust into an eligible retirement plan was not subject to federal income tax, it was not received for purposes of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C.S.

        Sexual Harassment.
   
   - Where employee was sexually harassed, she left employment for good cause attributable to her employer. Marlow v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C.

       </h5>
       <p>
        "Work".
   
   - The labor, task, or duty that affords one his accustomed means of livelihood is the type of "work" to which subdivision (1) of this section applies. In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Student's Services as Research Assistant Are Not Work.
   
   - The claimant's services as a research assistant under a fellowship granted to students by The University of North Carolina are not "employment" within the meaning of the Act, nor did they constitute "work" within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section. In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Voluntary".
   
   - An employee has not left his job voluntarily when events beyond the employee's control or the wishes of the employer cause the termination. Eason v. Gould, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 311 S.E.2d 372 (1984), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 618</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 223 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Later Wish to Rescind Resignation.
   
   - Fact that claimant later wished to rescind her resignation does not negate the fact that it was voluntarily offered. Whicker v. High Point Pub. Schools, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 287 S.E.2d 439 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice to Employer That Employee Is Leaving with Expectation of Later Returning.
   
   - Where an employee leaves employment because of a temporary disability with the expectation of later returning to work he is required to apply for a leave of absence, give a timely notice, or otherwise manifest an intention not to abandon the labor force. This is especially applicable where the leaving is an equivocal act, as where a pregnant woman leaves her employment and the leaving can be construed either as a temporary absence or an abandonment of the labor force. Sellers v. National Spinning Co., <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 307 S.E.2d 774 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 153</cite>, 311 S.E.2d 293 (1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        The termination of the claimant's studies
   
   at The University of North Carolina and subsequently his research assistantship, which was part of a fellowship granted to students, did not constitute a voluntary abandonment of work within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section. In re Scaringelli, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 648, 251 S.E.2d 728 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Resignation Is Involuntary.
   
   - Employees who quit or resign employment because they are asked to do so by their employer do not leave "voluntarily" within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section. Where the employer recommended that the employee resign, and clearly implied that the employee would be discharged if she failed to offer her resignation, this would constitute an involuntary separation. In re Werner, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 263 S.E.2d 4 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Good Cause" Defined.
   
   - "Good cause" is a reason which would be deemed by reasonable men and women valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 163, 266 S.E.2d 854 (1980); Intercraft Indus. Corp. v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 373</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 357 (1982); Huggins v.

       </p>
       <p>
        "Good cause," as used in subdivision (1) of this section connotes a reason for rejecting work that would be deemed by reasonable men and women as valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work. Sellers v. National Spinning Co., <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 307 S.E.2d 774 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 153</cite>, 311 S.E.2d 293 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A good cause within the meaning of subdivision (1) of this section includes a reaction to requests or policies of the employer which would be considered valid by reasonable minds. Eason v. Gould, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 311 S.E.2d 372 (1984), aff 'd, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 618</cite>, 324 S.E.2d 223 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Availability of Provision Establishing Good Cause Per Se.
   
   - In suit brought upon employee's separation for lack of available work, although some evidence in the record showed that claimant's weight interfered with some of his employment duties, where the employer offered no evidence that the claimant's weight interfered with all of claimant's duties to the extent that there was "no available work" for him, that portion of subdivision (1) establishing the issue of good cause per se was not available to employer. Seaberry v. W.T. Bridgers Contract Labor, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 372 S.E.2d 348 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the acts of the employer in removing the plant eleven miles caused plaintiff to be unable to continue her employment, since by moving its plant the company caused plaintiff's commuting distance to be increased fifty percent (50%) and, in effect, destroyed plaintiff's ability to go from her home to the job site, plaintiff's leaving work was in response to the removal of the plant and not an act of her own free will, and therefore plaintiff left her work involuntarily. Barnes v. Singer Co., <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 213</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 756 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Attributable to the Employer"
   
   - A cause is "attributable to the employer" under this section if it is produced, caused, or created as a result of actions by the employer. Huggins v. Precision Concrete Forming, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 571, 320 S.E.2d 416 (1984); Bunn v. North Carolina State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        Cause "attributable to the employer" is one which is produced, caused, created or as a result of actions by the employer. It also includes inaction by the employer. Ray v. Broyhill Furn. Indus., <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 344 S.E.2d 798 (1986).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent employer's moving of its plant was "good cause attributable to the employer" for petitioner's leaving her job, and she should not have been disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits. Watson v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 410, 432 S.E.2d 399 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A unilateral, substantial reduction in one's working hours by his employer
   
   may permit a finding of good cause attributable to the employer. Couch v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 366 S.E.2d 574, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 472</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 440 (1988).

       <p>
        <b>
         Findings.
        </b>
        - Trial court erred in affirming a ruling by the Employment Security Division Board of Review that a police officer left work for a reason other than good cause attributable to the employer and was not entitled to unemployment benefits because the Board made two conflicting, subjective findings: that the officer did not believe he had left work and that his employer believed he did; made a number of evidentiary findings that conflicted with its ultimate finding; and did not state that it made the finding that the officer "left work and was not discharged by the employer" by applying a reasonable person standard. Maness v. Vill. of Pinehurst, - N.C. App.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 467 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant's Quitting Held Voluntary.
   
   - Where there was no evidence that the notice of impending separation was offensive so as to embarrass or humiliate the claimant, and suitable work was available for seven more days, the quit by claimant prior to the date of scheduled separation was voluntary. Seaberry v. W.T. Bridgers Contract Labor, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 499, 372 S.E.2d 348 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Claimant Disqualified.
   
   - A claimant is disqualified from receiving unemployment compensation only if he voluntarily left his position and the leaving was without good cause attributable to the employer. Couch v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 366 S.E.2d 574, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 472</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 440 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        For an applicant to be disqualified from unemployment compensation benefits pursuant to subdivision (1) she must have voluntarily left her position and her leaving must be without good cause attributable to her employer. McGaha v. Nancy's Styling Salon, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 368 S.E.2d 49, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 174</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 110 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        If, under G.S. 96-14 (now repealed), an employee who has been told that he or she will be terminated on a certain date is disqualified from receiving benefits when he or she leaves before the stated date, then permitting the employee who has not been told that he or she will be terminated to leave and obtain unemployment benefits on the basis that the employee accepted the offer of enhanced early retirement would create an inconsistency and inequity in the law. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 562</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 776 (Aug. 28, 2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant Properly Disqualified by Division.
   
   - Claimant's resignation upon the employer's vehicle policy change was without good cause, such that the Division properly disqualified him from benefits, as he did not show that he suffered any financial injury or that the new policy had otherwise rendered his continued employment logistically impractical. King v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 743 S.E.2d 83 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether claimant left her position voluntarily, court must review external factors motivating employee.
   
   McGaha v. Nancy's Styling Salon, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 368 S.E.2d 49, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 174</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 110 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant voluntarily left work as a county social worker for good cause
   
   attributable to her employer and was thus entitled to unemployment compensation where she resigned her position because she was instructed by her supervisor to initiate custody proceedings for certain children after she had secured voluntary, revocable Board Home Agreements from the mothers to place their children in the temporary custody of others upon her assurances to the mothers that the children would be returned to the mothers upon request, and because she felt that the actions she was required to take violated the ethical standards of her profession. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 163, 266 S.E.2d 854 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>

        Acceptance of Voluntary Early Retirement Does Not Constitute Good Cause.
   
   - Unemployment claimant was disqualified from receiving benefits because he left his employment without good cause attributable to the employer, and although the Commission's findings of fact pointed to three possible actions attributable to the employer that could have been factors in claimant's acceptance of voluntary early retirement (VERP), none of those actions constituted good cause for claimant to accept the VERP and leave his employment; the mere offering of the VERP by the employer as part of its efforts to downsize could not be a good cause entitling claimant to benefits in that claimant had to submit a written application in order to accept the program, and claimant left work even though continued work was neither logistically impractical nor intolerable.

        An employee who quits a job upon being informed that he will be terminated
   
   four days later, and who applies immediately for unemployment benefits, is disqualified for the four-day period during which he could have continued to work. Nothing else appearing, however, he is not thereby disqualified subsequent to the date on which his employment would in any event have terminated. Poteat v. Employment Sec.

       <p>
        Where employee quit working after being given notice of impending separation, but knowing that there was still work available for seven days, the employee was properly denied unemployment benefits for the period during which he could have continued to work, but was entitled to benefits after the date on which employment was scheduled to terminate.

       The term "misconduct"
   
   within the meaning of subdivision (2) is limited to conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer's interest as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer's interests or of the employee's duties and obligations to his employer.

       "Misconduct," in the context of subdivision (2) of this section, is conduct which shows a wanton or willful disregard for the employer's interest, a deliberate violation of the employer's rules, or a wrongful intent. Hagan v. Peden Steel Co., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 363, 291 S.E.2d 308 (1982); Miller v. Guilford County Schools, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Misconduct sufficient to disqualify a discharged employee from receiving unemployment compensation is conduct which shows a wanton or willful disregard for the employer's interest, a deliberate violation of the employer's rules, or a wrongful intent. The obvious reasons for such a rule are to prevent benefits of the statute from going to persons who cause their unemployment by such callous, wanton, and deliberate misbehavior as would reasonably justify their discharge by an employer, and to prevent the dissipation of employment funds by persons engaged in such disqualifying acts. Intercraft Indus. Corp. v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 373</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 357 (1982); Collins v. B &amp; G Pie Co., <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C.

       "Misconduct" may consist in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee. Hagan v. Peden Steel Co., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 363, 291 S.E.2d 308 (1982).

      <p>
       The term "misconduct" in connection with one's work is limited to conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer's interests as is found in deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and
   substantial disregard of the employer's interests or of the employee's duties and obligations to his employer. This definition of "misconduct" suffices to encompass an employee's violation of the employer's reasonable attendance rules, of which he has notice, and his failure to give the employer proper notice of absences for which good cause may exist. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 191</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 242 (1983).

       Misconduct is conduct evincing a willful or wanton disregard for an employer's interest, as demonstrated by the following types of conduct: (1) deliberate violations or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of his employee; (2) carelessness or negligence of such degree or recurrence that it manifests equal culpability, wrongful intent, or evil design, or shows an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer's interests or of the employee's duties and obligations to his employer.

       Definition of Disqualifying Misconduct Not Exclusive.
   
   - The statutory language, "include but not be limited to" in the second paragraph of subdivision (2) of this section clearly indicates that the legislature did not intend an exclusive list; thus, the paragraph added to subdivision (2) in 1989 only illustrates and illuminates the more general language in the preceding paragraph of subdivision (2).

       Employer's Burden to Prove Misconduct Disqualifying Employee from Benefits.

       Leaving Work Station in Pursuit of Job Duties.
   
   - Where Commission made findings that receptionist employee continued to leave her work station after being requested not to do so, but that employee was not aware that her job was jeopardized by this conduct and employee was in pursuit of her job duties when she did deliver messages, competent evidence supported Employment Security Commission's finding that terminated employee was not even partially disqualified from receiving benefits, as she was not discharged for misconduct or substantial fault connected with her work.

       Discharge Under Occupational Safety and Health Act.
   
   - Claimant's discharge for willful refusal to wear ear protective devices as required by employer policy made mandatory by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 constituted a discharge for misconduct connected with his employment within the meaning of subdivision (2).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Petitioner was discharged for misconduct connected with his work as a matter of law:
   
   Petitioner's conduct evidenced a "willful or wanton disregard of his employer's interest" and was in "deliberate violation or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has a right to expect of his employee." Furthermore, petitioner's misconduct, "caused his unemployment," and he therefore was disqualified from receiving benefits pursuant to the statute. West v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 421 S.E.2d 395 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the petitioner reported to work smelling of alcohol
   
   and admitted to having consumed approximately five beers that day, and petitioner was offered participation in an alcohol treatment program as a condition of further employment, but refused to participate in the program despite the fact that he knew he would be terminated otherwise, the facts clearly supported the Commission's conclusion that petitioner was discharged for "misconduct." West v. Georgia-Pacific Corp., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 421 S.E.2d 395 (1992).

Lynch v. PPG Indus., <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 412 S.E.2d 163 (1992).
   <br />

      <p>
       The use of marijuana on company property during working hours
   
   in violation of the employer's rules constitutes "misconduct connected with his work" pursuant to subdivision (2) of this section. Hester v. Hanes Knitwear, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 730, 301 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 676</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 755 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Violation of Attendance Rules.
   
   - The definition of "misconduct" suffices to encompass an employee's violation of the employer's reasonable attendance rules, of which he has notice, and his failure to give the employer proper notice of absences for which good cause may exist. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 191</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 242 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where prior to the claimant's going on leave, she was on probation due to absence from work and tardiness in reporting to work; the employer had a known, reasonable policy that provided that medical leaves of absence can be granted or extended only upon the request of the employee's physician and the claimant was aware of this policy; and when the claimant reported back to work at the usual time she did not present a doctor's excuse for the previous day's absence, or to extend the leave of absence, the Commission could reasonably conclude that the claimant deliberately violated her employer's attendance rules. Therefore, the Commission's findings supported its conclusion that she had been discharged for "misconduct connected with her work." Davis v. Corning Glass Works, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 309 S.E.2d 258 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       While the mere violation of a work rule is not disqualifying misconduct where the evidence shows that the employee's actions were reasonable and were taken with good cause, deliberate violation or disregard of standards of behavior which an employer has a right to expect of his employee, or carelessness or negligence manifesting equal culpability may constitute misconduct in connection with one's employment sufficient to disqualify the employee to receive unemployment benefits. Collins v. B &amp; G Pie Co., <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 296 S.E.2d 809 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 469</cite>, 299 S.W.2d 221 (1983).
      </p>

       Most courts have held that persistent or chronic absences, at least where absences are without excuse or notice, and the employee has been given warnings by the employer, constitute misconduct within the meaning of the unemployment compensation laws. Obviously, when an employee is absent due to illness but fails to give proper notice the absence can amount to misconduct, not because of the illness per se but because the employee has an obligation to the employer to mitigate any damages an illness may cause the enterprise by giving appropriate notice. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 191</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 242 (1983).

      <p>
       When an employee who did not technically violate an employer's attendance policy was fired for abusing that policy, the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina, in ruling on the employee's claim for unemployment compensation benefits, had to decide if the employer had imposed a reasonable employee-specific policy on the employee with which she was able to conform and whether she violated that policy, before disqualifying the employee from the receipt of unemployment compensation benefits. Davis v. Britax Child Safety, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 593 S.E.2d 97 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision that petitioner was qualified to receive unemployment benefits was affirmed as findings of fact by the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina (ESC) did not indicate there was "substantial fault" under G.S. 96-14(2a) (now repealed) for petitioner's failure for failing to call in sick, as the ESC failed to enter specific findings of fact that the employer expressly warned him that failure to call in was a violation of employer's rules, and that continued violation of the rule would result in discharge. Boyland v. Southern Structures, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 615 S.E.2d 919 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former employee's absenteeism from her employment could not rise to the level of substantial fault, under G.S. 96-14(2a) (now repealed), because the evidence did not establish that the employee could exercise reasonable control over her actions resulting from her stress related medical problems. James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Excessive Tardiness.
   
   - Where petitioner received three written warnings in a five-month period for excessive tardiness and absenteeism and testified that after his third warning and suspension he knew that he could be "let go" for more tardiness or absences, the evidence was enough to meet the statutory requirements under subdivision (2A). Doyle v. Southeastern Glass Laminates, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 326, 409 S.E.2d 732 (1991), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 611</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 85 (1992).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Good Faith Effort to Comply with Notification of Absence Rule.
   
   - Where claimant was absent four consecutive days after a twenty-month infraction-free period of employment, and a combination of unfortunate circumstances prevented claimant from meeting the strict requirements of his employer's rule regarding notification of absence, but the evidence from the record was clear that claimant made a good faith effort to comply with the rule, the facts and circumstances did not support the Employment Security Commission's finding of misconduct. Helmandollar v. M.A.N. Truck &amp; Bus Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 328 S.E.2d 43 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Chronic or persistent absenteeism,
   
   in the face of warnings, and without good cause may constitute willful misconduct. Intercraft Indus. Corp. v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 373</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 357 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal to Report to Work.
   
   - A claimant's deliberate and unjustifiable refusal to report to work, when the employer has the right to insist on the employee's presence and when the claimant knows that his refusal would cause logistical problems for the employer, constitutes misconduct sufficient to disqualify claimant from receiving benefits under subdivision (2) of this section. In re Cantrell, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 718, 263 S.E.2d 1 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusal to Work Overtime.
   
   - Trial court erred in setting aside an agency's disqualification of a worker from receiving unemployment insurance benefits pursuant to G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed) based on the worker's refusal to work overtime; the worker failed to preserve for review his claim that procedural omissions by the agency violated his due process rights as required by G.S. 96-15(h). Graves v. Culp, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 748, 603 S.E.2d 829 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Inefficiency or unsatisfactory job performance
   
   does not amount to misconduct. Nor does violation of a work rule constitute misconduct if the evidence shows that the employee's actions were reasonable and taken with good cause, good cause being that deemed by reasonable men and women valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work. Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 313 S.E.2d 176 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Harm to the employer
   
   is not an element of misconduct as defined by subdivision (2), which speaks only of conduct and does not mention consequences. In re Gregory v. North Carolina Dep't of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 785, 379 S.E.2d 51 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An intent to violate a work rule is not equivalent to misconduct
   
   within the purview of subdivision (2) of this section as a matter of law. Kahl v. Smith Plumbing Co., <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 314 S.E.2d 574 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's grumbling and his statement that he intended in the future to violate a work rule did not rise to the level of willful or wanton disregard of the employer's standards such as to constitute misconduct connected with work. Kahl v. Smith Plumbing Co., <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 314 S.E.2d 574 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Violation of Work Rule Not Misconduct.
   
   - A violation of a work rule is not willful misconduct if the evidence shows that the employee's actions were reasonable and were taken with good cause. Intercraft Indus. Corp. v. Morrison, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 373</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 357 (1982); Lancaster v. Black Mt. Center, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. App.</cite> 136, 323 S.E.2d 760 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       A violation of a company rule will not be construed as misconduct within the meaning of subdivision (2) of this section, if the evidence shows that the action of the employee were reasonable and were taken with good cause. Good cause is a reason which would be deemed by reasonable men and women as valid and not indicative of an unwillingness to work. Helmandollar v. M.A.N. Truck &amp; Bus Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 328 S.E.2d 43 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Work Rule Unnecessary Where Conduct Forbidden by Statute.
   
   - Where petitioner, a professional level employee of the North Carolina Department of Revenue responsible for the collection of delinquent taxes, was discharged for failing to timely file, or to request an extension of time in which to file his 1985 and 1986 individual state income tax returns, facts supported the Commission's conclusion that petitioner was discharged for misconduct connected with his work under this section; petitioner argued that his failure to file his tax returns on time did not constitute misconduct under this statute because the department had no rule or policy requiring employees to file their returns on time; however, since petitioner's conduct was forbidden by statute, a work rule to the same effect was unnecessary. In re Gregory v. North Carolina Dep't of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 785, 379 S.E.2d 51 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The essence of subdivision (2A)
   
   is that if an employer establishes a reasonable job policy to which an employee can conform, her failure to do so constitutes substantial fault. Lindsey v. Qualex, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 406 S.E.2d 609, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 196</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 57 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasonableness of an employer's job requirements
   
   should be analyzed on a case-by-case basis in light of the totality of the circumstances surrounding the employee's function within the employer's business. Lindsey v. Qualex, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 406 S.E.2d 609, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 196</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 57 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where claimant's conduct was not within the more liberal standard of a substantial fault analysis
   
   under subsection (2A) of this section, the court would not reach the question of whether his conduct fell within the stricter standard of misconduct under subsection (2) of this section. Department of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety v. Featherston, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 384 S.E.2d 306 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial Fault Requires Violation After a Warning.
   
   - Although claimant's associations arguably placed him in violation of a departmental rule prohibiting dealings with criminals, such conduct would not rise to the level of substantial fault under subsection (2) of this section absent claimant's repetition of the violation after a warning. Department of Crime Control &amp; Pub. Safety v. Featherston, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 384 S.E.2d 306 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee's alteration of production records,
   
   resulting in overpayment to the employee, constitutes willful or wanton disregard of the employer's interest, in disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of the employee. Williams v. SCM Proctor Silex, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 299 S.E.2d 668, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 544</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 243 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Absence Due to Incarceration.
   
   - Absence from employment in violation of a work rule due to incarceration for a willful or legally unexcused probation violation amounts to "misconduct" in the context of this section. Collins v. B &amp; G Pie Co., <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 296 S.E.2d 809 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 469</cite>, 299 S.E.2d 221 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversion of Employer's Surplus Property.
   
   - Where the Commission found as facts that claimants had participated in a sale of their employer's surplus property without specific approval or authorization by the employer, that claimants never attempted to see that the employer received the proceeds of the sale, and that claimants knew or should have known that converting their employer's property to their own benefit was not permitted, the Commission logically concluded that claimants' conduct was misconduct connected with their work as defined by case law and properly decided that claimants were disqualified from unemployment benefits. Vanhorn v. Bassett Furn. Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 377, 333 S.E.2d 309 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee's conduct in not reporting directly to his supervisor,
   
   replying that he needed at least an hour to go over some papers on his desk, did not rise to the level of culpability required for a finding of "misconduct," considering the supervisor's admission that there was very little by way of information that he had to convey, that there was no urgent need for an immediate meeting, and that he could have conveyed the information by telephone. Umstead v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 331 S.E.2d 218.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence that employee left work early and without permission
   
   three days in a row, on grounds that his job was finished and he did not wish to disturb his supervisor at home at an early hour, and that he falsified his time records for these days, was sufficient to support the referee's conclusion that the employee was discharged for misconduct. Williams v. Burlington Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 441</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 842 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Protective Reflex Action.
   
   - Where student hit child care teacher in the stomach with a book bag, and teacher was pregnant at the time, and teacher's immediate reaction was to hit student in the shoulder to keep her from further hitting the teacher with the book bag, the facts did not show teacher acted deliberately and her actions were more of a reflex. Smith v. Kinder Care Learning Centers, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 362</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 30 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Assualt upon Co-Worker.
   
   - Where worker's assault on co-worker was purely retaliatory and combative, it was the type of misconduct which would disqualify an individual from employment benefits, even though petitioner reacted in the heat of anger. Fair v. St. Joseph's Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 437 S.E.2d 875 (1993), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 315</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 394 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Off-Duty Criminal Conduct.
   
   - Where an employee has engaged in off-duty criminal conduct, the agency need not show actual harm to its interests to demonstrate just cause for an employee's dismissal; however, it is well established that administrative agencies may not engage in arbitrary and capricious conduct. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       In determining whether a rational nexus exists between the type of off-duty criminal activity conducted by the employee and the employee's future ability to do his job, the Commission may consider the following factors: (1) how the conduct may have adversely affected clients or colleagues; (2) the relationship between the work performed by the employee and the type of criminal conduct committed; (3) the likelihood of recurrence of the questioned conduct and how the conduct may affect work performance, work quality, and the agency's good will and interests; (4) the proximity or remoteness in time of the conduct to the commencement of the disciplinary proceedings; (5) extenuating or aggravating circumstances; (6) the blameworthiness or praiseworthiness of the motives resulting in the conduct; and (7) the presence or absence of any relevant factors in mitigation. Eury v. North Carolina Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 446 S.E.2d 383 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 309</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 635 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial Fault Not Rising to Level of Misconduct.
   
   - The personal financial mismanagement of claimant, a legal secretary, constituted substantial fault connected with her work not rising to the level of misconduct for which she could be terminated, as the actions of the claimant, though unintentional and occurring primarily away from her work, had the effect of posing a serious threat to the reputation of her employer, the integrity of his law practice, and his relationship with clients and associates. Smith v. Spence &amp; Spence, Att'ys, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 636, 343 S.E.2d 256, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 707</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 440 (1986), affirming the decision of the Commission to disqualify the secretary from receiving unemployment benefits for a period of four weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       An employee who does only what her employer previously approved and apparently never disapproved or forbade cannot be said to have acted improperly or to have deviated from prudence, rectitude or duty. Baxter v. Bowman Gray School of Medicine, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 361 S.E.2d 109 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts did not support a conclusion that in not recording on her timecard 45 minutes that she was dizzy and laid down petitioner was substantially at fault within the purview of subdivision (2A) of this section, and therefore precluded from collecting unemployment compensation. Baxter v. Bowman Gray School of Medicine, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 409, 361 S.E.2d 109 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Meet Three Conditions of Section.
   
   - Where claimant in 1984 was denied unemployment benefits for the duration of his unemployment for being discharged for misconduct connected with his work, and after obtaining subsequent employment in 1987, he again became unemployed, but through no fault of his own, he did not meet the three conditions of this section, and the Commission's refusal to reduce his disqualification would be upheld. Josey v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 295</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 675 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Removal of Computer Hard Drive Sufficient Misconduct.
   
   - Employment Security Commission properly found that work-related misconduct was the basis of an employee's termination and properly denied unemployment benefits because the employee removed the hard drive from the employee's work computer and asserted a personal copyright interest in the employer's catalogs and web site without seeking and receiving permission, evidencing a deliberate disregard of standards of behavior which the employer had the right to expect of an employee. Binney v. Banner Therapy Prods., <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 310</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 717 (2008).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Misconduct Not Shown.
   
   - A worker's failure to notify his employer why he is absent from work cannot be regarded as "misconduct" or "fault" under the Employment Security Law, when the worker is unable to give notice because he is in the hospital with a broken back, and when the employer already has knowledge of his whereabouts and condition anyway. Facet Enters., Inc. v. Deloatch, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 350 S.E.2d 906 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's failure to inform the sheriff or chief deputy of the phone tap in lieutenant's office was a violation of departmental policy; however, this violation did not rise to the level of misconduct. Rather, given the unusual circumstances, including instructions petitioner received from federal agents, petitioner's failure to report to the sheriff the phone tap he had discovered was a reasonable response to the dilemma petitioner faced. Williams v. Davie County, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. App.</cite> 160, 461 S.E.2d 25 (1995).
      </p>
      <p>
       Decision that petitioner was qualified to receive unemployment benefits was affirmed as findings by the Employment Security Commission of North Carolina (ESC) did not indicate there was "substantial fault" under G.S. 96-14(2a) (now repealed) for petitioner's failure to timely submit log notes; the ESC failed to enter specific findings that the employer expressly warned petitioner that failure to submit log notes was a violation of employer's rules, and that petitioner continued to violate this requirement after being warned. Boyland v. Southern Structures, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 615 S.E.2d 919 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission erred in concluding that the former employee's conduct in returning 15 minutes late to the former employee's work area meant that the former employee was at substantial fault for tardiness that justified the former employee's discharge and denial of unemployment benefits for nine weeks; the commission found as a fact that the former employee's tardiness was due to the fact that the employee became ill and had to go to the bathroom as a result, and the former employee could not be at substantial fault for a matter over which the former employee did not have reasonable control, that of becoming ill. Applewhite v. Alliance One Int'l, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 271, 654 S.E.2d 764 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's former employer failed to meet its burden of showing that the claimant was discharged for misconduct connected with the work because the claimant's refusal to attest on a document that the employer had conducted a complete investigation into the claimant's internal complaint and taken appropriate corrective actions in response did not rise to the level of misconduct sufficient to disqualify the claimant from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Burroughs v. Green Apple, LLC, - N.C. App.

   In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Former subdivision (5) of this section was in plain and unambiguous language,
   
   and needs only a literal interpretation to ascertain the legislative intent as expressed therein. In re Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 528</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 520 (1953).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The effect of the 1961 amendment
   
   was to eliminate from former subdivision (5) the means therein provided by which an employee might escape disqualification. In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former subdivision (5) extended the disqualification to workers at a factory, establishment, or other premise which supplies necessary materials or services to the plant where the claimants were last employed. In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The disqualification contained in the 1961 amendment to former subdivision (5) involved a question of degree and not of principle. In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963).

       Employees who participate in, finance or who are directly interested in a labor dispute
   
   which results in stoppage of work, or who are members of a grade or class of workers which has members employed at the premises at which the stoppage occurs, any of whom, immediately before the stoppage occurs, participate in, finance or are directly interested in such labor dispute, are not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits during the stoppage of work, and each employee-claimant is required to show to the satisfaction of the Commission that he is not disqualified under the terms of this section. In re Steelman, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R. 929 (1941).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Employees Need Not Support Dispute to Be Disqualified.
   
   - Employee-claimants who are not directly interested in the labor dispute which brings about the stoppage of work, and who do not participate in, help finance or benefit from the dispute, are nevertheless disqualified from unemployment compensation benefits if they belong to a grade or class of workers employed at the premises immediately before the commencement of the stoppage, some of whom, immediately before the stoppage occurs, participate in, finance or are directly interested in such labor dispute. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 277</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 385 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section disqualifies for unemployment compensation benefits employees belonging to a grade or class of workers some of whom participated in and were directly interested in the strike which brought about a stoppage of work, notwithstanding the fact that the employee-claimants were not members of the union and did not participate in or help finance the strike, especially where the strike involved, in addition to a maintenance of membership clause in the contract of employment, a general increase in wages, from which the employee-claimants stood to benefit. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Lunceford, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 570</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 497 (1948).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether the unemployment is due to a labor dispute,
   
   or whether it is not, is a question to be determined in each case. The line of demarcation is not the end of the strike but the end of work stoppage due to the strike. That test is applied to all alike, and there is no discrimination. In re Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 528</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 520 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       For the disqualification provisions of former subdivision (5) of this section to apply, the Employment Security Commission must find that "total or partial unemployment is caused by a labor dispute in active progress." Thus, the only type of active labor dispute which keeps the idle worker disqualified for benefits is one which causes unemployment. In re Sarvis, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Stoppage of Work Caused by Labor Dispute Begins and Ends.
   
   - A stoppage of work commences at the plant of the employer when a definite check in production operations occurs, and a stoppage of work ceases when operations are resumed on a normal basis; but the stoppage of work caused by a labor dispute must not exceed the time which is reasonably necessary and required to physically resume normal operations in such plant or establishment. In re Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 528</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 520 (1953).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An abandonment of the strike and unconditional offer to return to work
   
   by employees who were replaced during the pendency of the strike lifts the labor dispute disqualification. In re Sarvis, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       An employer's inability to reinstate previously replaced employees after they abandoned their strike and unconditionally offered to return to work changed the cause of unemployment and lifted the disqualification for benefits In re Sarvis, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of NLRB Proceedings on Labor Dispute Disqualification.
   
   - An election petition and an unfair labor practice charge pending before the National Labor Relations Board after the end of employees' strike did not keep the labor dispute disqualification in effect after the conclusion of the strike. In re Sarvis, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 475</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 434 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A "labor dispute" includes work stoppage caused by management lockouts.
   
   In re Usery, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 703, 230 S.E.2d 585 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 265</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 396 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Burden of Proof.
   
   - Where the employer resists recovery of unemployment compensation on the ground that claimants' unemployment was due to a work stoppage resulting from a labor dispute, each claimant is required to show to the satisfaction of the Commission that he is not disqualified for benefits. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 381</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 403 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Resume Work After Dispute.
   
   - The evidence tended to show that employee-claimants not only did not work during the period of stoppage of work at the employer's plant caused by a labor dispute but also that they did not resume work after operations at the plant were resumed, and after notification by the employer that jobs were available. There was also evidence on behalf of claimants that they did not return to their jobs because of the labor dispute. The Commission ruled that claimants were not entitled to benefits during the stoppage of work. It was held that the employer is not prejudiced by the further order of the Commission that the eligibility of claimants to benefits subsequent to the resumption of operations at the plant should be determined, since it must be presumed the Commission will determine eligibility of each claimant for such benefits in accordance with objective standards or criteria set up in this Chapter, but the existence and effect of a labor dispute may have an essential bearing upon the eligibility of claimants, the suitableness of work offered, and the disqualifications for benefits. In re Steelman, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R. 929 (1941).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice That Due to Labor Dispute Employees Might Seek Other Employment.
   
   - A finding that after a strike which closed the plant and after the employer's attempt to resume operations had proved futile, the employer posted a notice stating that all operations at the mill would cease for an indefinite period and that employees were free to seek employment elsewhere, was held insufficient to support a conclusion of law by the Commission that subsequent to the posting of the notice the unemployment of claimants was not due to stoppage of work because of a labor dispute, since the notice merely signified the willingness of the employer to terminate its employment relationship with any worker who elected to withdraw from the existing labor dispute and seek work elsewhere, but did not alter the status of any employee who refrained from exercising this option. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 381</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 403 (1950).

        Design of Employment Security Law.
   
   - See In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The Employment Security Act was not designed to provide benefits to a person who is physically unable to work
   
   or who, for any other personal reason, would at no time be in a position to accept any employment if it were tendered to him, however capable and industrious such person may be. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A person who must quit a job for health reasons but who is available for other employment
   
   is clearly not a person envisioned by this language. Both reason and justice demand that such a claimant receive unemployment benefits. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        For discussion of whether a person who loses his employment for health reasons has left involuntarily with good cause attributable to the employer, see Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction.
   
   - This section and G.S. 96-14 (now repealed) as cognate statutes provide the overall formula governing the right to unemployment compensation benefits. Being thus in pari materia, they are to be construed together. In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956); In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits.
   
   - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina, there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow v. Holland Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 695, 308 S.E.2d 335 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 308</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 651 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Able to Work".
   
   - The terms "able to work", "available for work", and "suitable employment" are not precise terms capable of application with mathematical precision. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972); In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 207 S.E.2d 321, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974). See also, In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The words "available for work" in this section mean "available for suitable work"
   
   in the same sense as the words "suitable work" are used in G.S. 96-14 (now repealed). In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956); In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "available for work" is not susceptible of precise definition, and whether a person is available for work differs according to the facts of each individual case. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Availability requirement is said to be satisfied
   
   when an individual is willing, able and ready to accept suitable work which he does not have good cause to refuse, that is, when he is generally attached to the labor market. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To be available for work
   
   a person must be in such a position that prospective employers will hire him for work which he is capable of performing. In re Yarboro, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 257 S.E.2d 658 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For meaning of "available for work,"
   
   see In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A petitioner is not required to be available for work at all times.
   
   McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section forbids denial of unemployment benefits solely because of school enrollment
   
   and attendance. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where petitioner was both a full-time student and a full-time employee when she was laid off
   
   from work, she could not be denied unemployment benefits if she was "otherwise eligible" to receive those benefits, and in determining whether she was otherwise eligible for benefits, this section required that she not be denied benefits because of school enrollment and attendance. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant refusing to consider employment during her Sabbath
   
   did not render herself unavailable for work within the meaning of this section. In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Large measure of administrative discretion must be granted
   
   to the Employment Security Commission in applying the terms "able to work", "available for work", and "suitable employment" to specific cases. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 207 S.E.2d 321, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Restrictions Claimant Places on His Employment.
   
   - It is essentially a matter of degree to ascertain to what extent a claimant can impose restrictions and on what these restrictions must be based. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The problem is whether or not the restrictions which the claimant places on his employment serve to limit the work which a claimant can accept to such a degree that he is no longer genuinely attached to the labor force. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor Market to Be Described in Terms of Individual.
   
   - Since, under unemployment compensation laws, it is the availability of an individual that is required to be tested, the labor market must be described in terms of the individual. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Significance of Claimant's Age in Determining Labor Market.
   
   - For a case discussing the significance of the fact that employers in a locality do not customarily employ persons of claimant's advanced age, see In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant's Burden of Proof.
   
   - A claimant in an appeals hearing has the burden of proving that he is not disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Quantum of Proof of Availability for Work.
   
   - The Commission erred in requiring a 70-year-old claimant to show by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that she had reentered the labor force after having voluntarily retired from her job as a laundry worker. Under former G.S. 143-318(1), the claimant had the burden to show that she was "available for work" only by the greater weight of the evidence. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty to Assist Claimant Appearing Without Counsel.
   
   - The Commission is not required to notify a claimant of the specific facts that he will be required to establish or to prove the claimant's case for him. However, the Commission does have the responsibility to conduct its hearings in a manner that allows a party the opportunity to make the required showing. Especially in the case of an uncounseled claimant, the Commission's responsibility involves asking the right questions. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Improper to Disqualify Pro Se Claimant Where Referee Did Not Ask Relevant Questions.
   
   - It was not appropriate for the Commission to disqualify a pro se claimant from receiving benefits because she failed to produce evidence of facts that case law from other states says she must establish when the appeals referee never even asked her the relevant questions. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the Commission's findings of fact are amply supported by the evidence
   
   in the record, the Supreme Court is bound by the Commission's findings of fact. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Showing Failure to Actively Seek Work.
   
   - Evidence that during a period of six months claimant's efforts to obtain employment, in addition to reporting to the employment service office, were limited to two occasions at one mill and one occasion at each of three other mills, is sufficient to sustain the Commission's finding that he had failed to show that he had been actively seeking work within the purview of subdivision (3) of subsection (a) of this section. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 262</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 890 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Vacation Periods.
   
   - The statute does not prescribe; it merely limits the total vacation period for which an employee is ineligible for compensation to a total of two weeks. In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plant Shut Down for Additional Week of Vacation.
   
   - Where an employer, in addition to one week paid vacation provided for in the contract, shuts down its plant for an additional week of vacation during the Christmas period, its employees are not entitled to unemployment compensation for the additional week under this section. In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        By their adherence to the terms of the guaranteed annual income provisions
   
   of their collective bargaining agreement, claimants placed themselves in a position which, for all practical purposes, eliminated their availability for work in contravention of the requirements of subdivision (a)(3) of this section. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Commission erred in awarding unemployment benefits without making a finding
   
   as required by subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) that claimant had registered for work and continued to report to an employment office and that he had made a claim for benefits in accordance with G.S. 96-15(a). The Commission's finding that three separate claim series were started for claimant was insufficient to meet the statutory requirements. In re George, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 490, 256 S.E.2d 826 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant Not Available While Awaiting Sentencing.
   
   - Where a claimant for unemployment compensation pleaded guilty to a charge of selling a controlled substance and testified that he was not hired because prospective employers were "waiting to see what my sentence will be," the Commission could conclude from this that claimant was not in such a position that prospective employers would hire him and that he was not "available for work." In re Yarboro, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 257 S.E.2d 658 (1979).
   <br />

       <p>
        Employee of Project Headstart.
   
   - Project Headstart is a school within the ordinary meaning of the term, and the situation of an employee of Project Headstart is one of those addressed by the "secondary school provision" of this section, excluding from unemployment benefits those who are subject to school-related seasonal unemployment. In re Huntley, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 255 S.E.2d 574, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 297</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 913 (1979).

       § 96-14.10. Disciplinary suspension.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The disciplinary suspension of an employee for 30 or fewer consecutive calendar days does not constitute good cause for leaving work. An individual who is on suspension is not available for work and is not eligible for benefits for any week during any part of the disciplinary suspension. If the disciplinary suspension exceeds 30 days, the individual is considered to have been discharged from work because of the acts or omissions that caused the suspension and the issue is whether the discharge was for disqualifying reasons. During the period of suspension of 30 or fewer days, the individual is considered to be attached to the employer's payroll, and the issue of separation from work is held in abeyance until a claim is filed for a week to which this section does not apply.

       Design of Employment Security Law.
   
   - See In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Employment Security Act was not designed to provide benefits to a person who is physically unable to work
   
   or who, for any other personal reason, would at no time be in a position to accept any employment if it were tendered to him, however capable and industrious such person may be. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who must quit a job for health reasons but who is available for other employment
   
   is clearly not a person envisioned by this language. Both reason and justice demand that such a claimant receive unemployment benefits. Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       For discussion of whether a person who loses his employment for health reasons has left involuntarily with good cause attributable to the employer, see Milliken &amp; Co. v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 492, 309 S.E.2d 733 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 402</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 272 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Construed with G.S. 96-14.
   
   - This section and G.S. 96-14 (now repealed) as cognate statutes provide the overall formula governing the right to unemployment compensation benefits. Being thus in pari materia, they are to be construed together. In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956); In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Recovery of Both Workers' Compensation and Unemployment Benefits.
   
   - Several states allow the recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits for the same time period, in the absence of an express statutory prohibition. In North Carolina, there is no express prohibition of duplicate benefits, although a persuasive argument can be made that the General Assembly intended that there be no recovery of both workers' compensation and unemployment benefits. Dolbow v. Holland Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 695, 308 S.E.2d 335 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 308</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 651 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Able to Work".
   
   - The terms "able to work", "available for work", and "suitable employment" are not precise terms capable of application with mathematical precision. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972); In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 207 S.E.2d 321, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974). See also, In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The words "available for work" mean "available for suitable work"
   
   in the same sense as the words "suitable work" are used in G.S. 96-14 (now repealed). In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956); In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       The phrase "available for work" is not susceptible of precise definition, and whether a person is available for work differs according to the facts of each individual case. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974); McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Availability requirement is said to be satisfied
   
   when an individual is willing, able and ready to accept suitable work which he does not have good cause to refuse, that is, when he is generally attached to the labor market. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       To be available for work
   
   a person must be in such a position that prospective employers will hire him for work which he is capable of performing. In re Yarboro, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 257 S.E.2d 658 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       For meaning of "available for work,"
   
   see In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A petitioner is not required to be available for work at all times.
   
   McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section forbids denial of unemployment benefits solely because of school enrollment
   
   and attendance. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where petitioner was both a full-time student and a full-time employee when she was laid off
   
   from work, she could not be denied unemployment benefits if she was "otherwise eligible" to receive those benefits, and in determining whether she was otherwise eligible for benefits, this section required that she not be denied benefits because of school enrollment and attendance. McNeil v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 365 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A claimant refusing to consider employment during her Sabbath
   
   did not render herself unavailable for work within the meaning of this section. In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Large measure of administrative discretion must be granted
   
   to the Employment Security Commission in applying the terms "able to work", "available for work", and "suitable employment" to specific cases. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 207 S.E.2d 321, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Restrictions Claimant Places on His Employment.
   
   - It is essentially a matter of degree to ascertain to what extent a claimant can impose restrictions and on what these restrictions must be based. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is whether or not the restrictions which the claimant places on his employment serve to limit the work which a claimant can accept to such a degree that he is no longer genuinely attached to the labor force. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Labor Market to Be Described in Terms of Individual.
   
   - Since, under unemployment compensation laws, it is the availability of an individual that is required to be tested, the labor market must be described in terms of the individual. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Significance of Claimant's Age in Determining Labor Market.
   
   - For a case discussing the significance of the fact that employers in a locality do not customarily employ persons of claimant's advanced age, see In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 186 S.E.2d 623, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant's Burden of Proof.
   
   - A claimant in an appeals hearing has the burden of proving that he is not disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantum of Proof of Availability for Work.
   
   - The Commission erred in requiring a 70-year-old claimant to show by clear, cogent and convincing evidence that she had reentered the labor force after having voluntarily retired from her job as a laundry worker. Under former G.S. 143-318(1), the claimant had the burden to show that she was "available for work" only by the greater weight of the evidence. In re Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 598</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 245 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duty to Assist Claimant Appearing Without Counsel.
   
   - The Commission is not required to notify a claimant of the specific facts that he will be required to establish or to prove the claimant's case for him. However, the Commission does have the responsibility to conduct its hearings in a manner that allows a party the opportunity to make the required showing. Especially in the case of an uncounseled claimant, the Commission's responsibility involves asking the right questions. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Improper to Disqualify Pro Se Claimant Where Referee Did Not Ask Relevant Questions.
   
   - It was not appropriate for the Commission to disqualify a pro se claimant from receiving benefits because she failed to produce evidence of facts that case law from other states says she must establish when the appeals referee never even asked her the relevant questions. Hoke v. Brinlaw Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 327 S.E.2d 254 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the Commission's findings of fact are amply supported by the evidence
   
   in the record, the Supreme Court is bound by the Commission's findings of fact. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence Showing Failure to Actively Seek Work.
   
   - Evidence that during a period of six months claimant's efforts to obtain employment, in addition to reporting to the employment service office, were limited to two occasions at one mill and one occasion at each of three other mills, is sufficient to sustain the Commission's finding that he had failed to show that he had been actively seeking work within the purview of this section. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 262</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 890 (1949).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Vacation Periods.
   
   - The statute does not prescribe; it merely limits the total vacation period for which an employee is ineligible for compensation to a total of two weeks. In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Plant Shut Down for Additional Week of Vacation.
   
   - Where an employer, in addition to one week paid vacation provided for in the contract, shuts down its plant for an additional week of vacation during the Christmas period, its employees are not entitled to unemployment compensation for the additional week under this section. In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       By their adherence to the terms of the guaranteed annual income provisions
   
   of their collective bargaining agreement, claimants placed themselves in a position which, for all practical purposes, eliminated their availability for work in contravention of the requirements of this section. In re Beatty, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 226</cite>, 210 S.E.2d 193 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Commission erred in awarding unemployment benefits without making a finding
   
   that claimant had registered for work and continued to report to an employment office and that he had made a claim for benefits in accordance with G.S. 96-15(a). The Commission's finding that three separate claim series were started for claimant was insufficient to meet the statutory requirements. In re George, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 490, 256 S.E.2d 826 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Claimant Not Available While Awaiting Sentencing.
   
   - Where a claimant for unemployment compensation pleaded guilty to a charge of selling a controlled substance and testified that he was not hired because prospective employers were "waiting to see what my sentence will be," the Commission could conclude from this that claimant was not in such a position that prospective employers would hire him and that he was not "available for work." In re Yarboro, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 257 S.E.2d 658 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee of Project Headstart.
   
   - Project Headstart is a school within the ordinary meaning of the term, and the situation of an employee of Project Headstart is one of those addressed by the "secondary school provision" of this section, excluding from unemployment benefits those who are subject to school-related seasonal unemployment. In re Huntley, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 255 S.E.2d 574, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 297</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 913 (1979).

        Generally.
   
   - See In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 629</cite>, 161 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suitability is not a matter of rigid fixation.
   
   It depends upon circumstances and may change with changing circumstances. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Unsuitable" Work May Become "Suitable".
   
   - Work which may be deemed "unsuitable" at the inception of the claimant's unemployment and for a reasonable time thereafter, because it pays less than his prior earning capacity, may thereafter become "suitable" work when consideration is given to the length of unemployment and the prospects for obtaining customary work at his prior earning capacity. What is a "reasonable time" is not rigid and inflexible and it must initially be determined as a question of fact under the peculiar circumstances of each individual case. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment which may not be suitable while there is still a good present expectancy of obtaining other employment more nearly proportionate to the ability of the worker may become suitable if that expectancy is not realized within a reasonable time. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant is entitled to a reasonable length of time within which to find work at his higher skill
   
   before work calling for less competence and lower remuneration can be found to be suitable. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But the longer a claimant is unemployed, the more he is obligated to take less desirable work
   
   and to make himself available to take it. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Elements Which Must Be Considered in Determining "Suitable Work".
   
   - The skill and capacity of the worker, his accustomed remuneration, his expectancy of obtaining equivalent employment, and the time which he had had to obtain it may be taken into account in determining "suitable work." In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        It may reasonably be thought that employment which requires a highly trained and skilled worker, who still has a fair prospect of securing work in his own line to step down into work of a substantially lower grade, at substantially less pay, before he has had a chance to look about him, is not truly "suitable." Acceptance of such employment might conceivably condemn the worker permanently to a scale of employment lower than that to which his training, skill, and industry fairly entitled him. In re Troutman, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 289</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 613 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distance from Residence Must Be Considered.
   
   - The determination of whether the work offered a claimant is suitable requires a consideration of several factors, including the distance of the available work from the employee's residence. Housecalls Nursing Servs., Inc. v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 454 S.E.2d 836 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distance from Residence Found Too Great.
   
   - Employment Security Commission of North Carolina (ESC) correctly ordered that claimant certified nursing assistant was not disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits where evidence showed that claimant's 1983 car had over 100,000 miles on it, and that employer offered her a job which consisted of three, two-hour sessions with a patient who lived forty-five miles from her residence. Housecalls Nursing Servs., Inc. v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 275, 454 S.E.2d 836 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Work which requires one to violate his moral standards is not ordinarily "suitable work"
   
   within the meaning of this section. In re Miller, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 509</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 241 (1956).

       § 96-14.13. Limitation on benefits due to lump sum payments.
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      An individual is disqualified from receiving benefits for any week for which the individual receives any sum from the employer pursuant to an order of a court, the National Labor Relations Board, or another adjudicative agency or by private agreement, consent, or arbitration for loss of pay by reason of discharge. When the employer pays a lump sum that covers a period of more than one week, the amount paid is allocated to the weeks in the period on a pro rata basis as determined by the Division. If the amount prorated to a week would, if it had been earned by the individual during that week of unemployment, have resulted in a reduced benefit payment as provided in G.S. 96-14.2, the individual is entitled to receive the reduced payment if the individual is otherwise eligible for benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      Benefits paid for weeks of unemployment for which back pay awards or other similar compensation are made constitutes an overpayment of benefits. The employer must deduct the overpayment from the award prior to payment to the employee and must send the overpayment to the Division within five days of the payment for application against the overpayment. Overpayments not remitted to the Division are subject to the same collection procedures as contributions. The removal of charges made against the employer's account as a result of the previously paid benefits applies to the calendar year in which the Division receives the overpayment.

     <p>
      The definitions in this section were redesignated at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes to preserve alphabetical order.

     <p>
      The reference in subdivision (g)(2) to "subsection (a)(6)" appears to have been originally intended to be a reference to subdivision (a)(6), now subdivision (b)(7).
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2012-134, s. 1(a) and (b), provide: "(a) The General Assembly finds that it enacted Section 6.16 of Session Law 2011-145 and, in so doing, validated the effects of the Governor's Executive Order No. 113 with the stated intent to allow extended benefits to be paid under the Tax Relief Act of 2010 so long as payment of the extended benefits did not hinder the State's ability to reduce its debt owed to the federal government for unemployment benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) It is deemed, therefore, to be in the best interest of the people of this State that the General Assembly now ratify and hereby validate the effects of the Governor's Executive Order No. 113."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2012-134, s. 1(f), provides: "To maintain the rule of law with respect to State and federal relations pertaining to employment security laws in North Carolina, any executive order issued by the Governor that purports to extend unemployment insurance benefits, whether those benefits will be paid from federal or State funds, is void ab initio, unless the executive order is issued upon authority that is conferred expressly by an act enacted by the General Assembly or granted specifically to the Governor by the Congress of the United States."
     </p>
     <p>
      Session Laws 2013-2, s. 11, as amended by Session Laws 2013-224, s. 19, provides: "This act becomes effective July 1, 2013. Changes made by this act to unemployment benefits apply to claims for benefits filed on or after June 30, 2013. The requirements of G.S. 96-15(a1) apply to any week of an attached claim filed on or after June 30, 2013. Changes made by this act to require an account balance by an employer that is a governmental entity or a nonprofit organization and that elects to finance benefits by making reimbursable payments in lieu of contributions apply to advance payments payable for calendar quarters beginning on or after July 1, 2013. Changes made by this act to the determination and application of the contribution rate apply to contributions payable for calendar quarters beginning on or after January 1, 2014."

       Generally. - Claims for benefits must be made in accordance with rules adopted by the Division. An employer must provide individuals providing services for it access to information concerning the unemployment compensation program. The Division must supply an employer with any printed statements and other materials that the Division requires an employer to provide to individuals without cost to the employer.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-15ol1-a1">
       Attached Claims. - An employer may file claims for employees through the use of automation in the case of partial unemployment. An employer may file an attached claim for an employee only once during a benefit year, and the period of partial unemployment for which the claim is filed may not exceed six weeks. To file an attached claim, an employer must pay the Division an amount equal to the full cost of unemployment benefits payable to the employee under the attached claim at the time the attached claim is filed. The Division must credit the amounts paid to the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-15ol1-a2">
       Federal Disaster Declaration. - An employer may file claims for employees through the use of automation in the case of unemployment due directly to a disaster covered by a federal disaster declaration.

        <li id="t96a2Ds96-15ol1b1">
         Initial Determination. - A representative designated by the Division shall promptly examine the claim and shall determine whether or not the claim is valid. If the claim is determined to be not valid for any reason other than lack of base period earnings, the claim shall be referred to an Adjudicator for a decision as to the issues presented. If the claim is determined to be valid, a monetary determination shall be issued showing the week with respect to when benefits shall commence, the weekly benefit amount payable, and the potential maximum duration thereof. The claimant shall be furnished a copy of such monetary determination showing the amount of wages paid him by each employer during his base period and the employers by whom such wages were paid, his benefit year, weekly benefit amount, and the maximum amount of benefits that may be paid to him for unemployment during the benefit year. When a claim is not valid due to lack of earnings in his base period, the determination shall so designate. The claimant shall be allowed 10 days from the earlier of mailing or delivery of his monetary determination to him within which to protest his monetary determination and upon the filing of such protest, unless said protest be satisfactorily resolved, the claim shall be referred to the Assistant Secretary or designee for a decision as to the issues presented. All base period employers, as well as the most recent employer of a claimant on a temporary layoff, shall be notified upon the filing of a claim which establishes a benefit year.
      (b) (1)  Initial Determination. - A representative designated by the Division shall promptly examine the claim and shall determine whether or not the claim is valid. If the claim is determined to be not valid for any reason other than lack of base period earnings, the claim shall be referred to an Adjudicator for a decision as to the issues presented.

        <li id="t96a2Ds96-15ol1bb2">
         Adjudication. - When a protest is made by the claimant to the initial or monetary determination, or a question or issue is raised or presented as to the eligibility of a claimant, or whether any disqualification should be imposed, or benefits denied or adjusted pursuant to G.S. 96-18, the matter shall be referred to an adjudicator. The adjudicator may consider any matter, document or statement deemed to be pertinent to the issues, including telephone conversations, and after such consideration shall render a conclusion as to the claimant's benefit entitlements. The adjudicator shall notify the claimant and all other interested parties of the conclusion reached. The conclusion of the adjudicator shall be deemed the final decision of the Division unless within 30 days after the date of notification or mailing of the conclusion, whichever is earlier, a written appeal is filed pursuant to rules adopted by the Division. The Division shall be deemed an interested party for such purposes and may remove to itself or transfer to an appeals referee the proceedings involving any claim pending before an adjudicator.

       Appeals. - Unless an appeal from the adjudicator is withdrawn, an appeals referee or hearing officer shall set a hearing in which the parties are given reasonable opportunity to be heard. The conduct of hearings shall be governed by suitable rules adopted by the Division. The rules need not conform to common law or statutory rules of evidence or technical or formal rules of procedure but shall provide for the conduct of hearings in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties. The hearings may be conducted by conference telephone call or other similar means provided that if any party files with the Division prior written objection to the telephone procedure, that party will be afforded an opportunity for an in-person hearing at such place in the State as the Division by rule shall provide. The hearing shall be scheduled for a time that, as much as practicable, least intrudes on and reasonably accommodates the ordinary business activities of an employer and the return to employment of a claimant. The appeals referee or hearing officer may affirm or modify the conclusion of the adjudicator or issue a new decision in which findings of fact and conclusions of law will be set out or dismiss an appeal when the appellant fails to appear at the appeals hearing to prosecute the appeal after having been duly notified of the appeals hearing. The evidence taken at the hearings before the appeals referee shall be recorded and the decision of the appeals referee shall be deemed to be the final decision of the Division unless within 10 days after the date of notification or mailing of the decision, whichever is earlier a written appeal is filed pursuant to such rules as the Board of Review and the Division may adopt. No person may be appointed as an appeals referee or hearing officer unless he or she possesses the minimum qualifications necessary to be a staff attorney eligible for designation by the Division as a hearing officer under G.S. 96-4(q). No appeals referee or hearing officer in full-time permanent status may engage in the private practice of law as defined in G.S. 84-2.1 while serving in office as appeals referee or hearing officer; violation of this prohibition shall be grounds for removal. Whenever an appeal is taken from a decision of the appeals referee or hearing officer, the appealing party shall submit a clear written statement containing the grounds for the appeal within the time allowed by law for taking the appeal, and if such timely statement is not submitted, the Board of Review may dismiss the appeal.

A continuance may be granted only upon such terms and conditions as the Division by rule shall provide. Acceptable grounds for granting a continuance shall include, but not be limited to, those instances when a party to the proceeding, a witness, or counsel of record has an obligation of service to the State, such as service as a member of the North Carolina General Assembly, or an obligation to participate in a proceeding in a court of greater jurisdiction.

       Review by the Board of Review.  -. The Board of Review may on its own motion affirm, modify, or set aside any decision of an appeals referee, hearing officer, or other employee assigned to make a decision on the basis of the evidence previously submitted in such case, or direct the taking of additional evidence, or may permit any of the parties to such decision to initiate further appeals before it, or may provide for group hearings in such cases as the Board of Review finds appropriate. The Board of Review may remove itself or transfer to an appeals referee, hearing officer, or other employee assigned to make a decision the proceedings on any claim pending before an appeals referee, hearing officer, or other employee assigned to make a decision.

       Procedure. - The manner in which disputed claims shall be presented, the reports thereon required from the claimant and from employers, and the conduct of hearings and appeals shall be in accordance with rules adopted by the Division for determining the rights of the parties, whether or not such rules conform to common-law or statutory rules of evidence and other technical rules of procedure.

      <li id="t96a2Ds96-15ol1h">
       Judicial Review. - A decision of the Board of Review becomes final 30 days after the date of notification or mailing of the decision, whichever is earlier, unless a party to the decision seeks judicial review as provided in this subsection. Judicial review is permitted only after a party claiming to be aggrieved by the decision has exhausted the remedies provided in this Chapter and has filed a petition for review in the superior court of the county in which the petitioner resides or the county in which the petitioner's principal place of business is located. The petition for review must explicitly state what exceptions are taken to the decision or procedure and what relief the petitioner seeks. Within 10 days after the petition is filed with the court, the petitioner must serve copies of the petition by personal service or by certified mail, return receipt requested, upon the Division and upon all parties of record to the Division proceedings. The Division must furnish the petitioner, upon request, the names and addresses of the parties as found in the records of the Division. The Division is a party to any judicial action involving any of its decisions and may be represented in the judicial action by any qualified attorney who has been designated by it for that purpose. Any questions regarding the requirements of this subsection concerning the service or filing of a petition shall be determined by the superior court. Any party to the Division proceeding may become a party to the review proceeding by notifying the court within 10 days after receipt of the copy of the petition. Any person aggrieved may petition to become a party by filing a motion to intervene as provided in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 24.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-15ol1i">
       Review Proceedings. - If a timely petition for review has been filed and served as provided in G.S. 96-15(h), the court may make party defendant any other party it deems necessary or proper to a just and fair determination of the case. The Division may, in its discretion, certify to the reviewing court questions of law involved in any decision by it. In any judicial proceeding under this section, the findings of fact by the Division, if there is any competent evidence to support them and in the absence of fraud, shall be conclusive, and the jurisdiction of the court shall be confined to questions of law. Such actions and the questions so certified shall be heard in a summary manner and shall be given precedence over all civil cases. An appeal may be taken from the judgment of the superior court, as provided in civil cases. The Division shall have the right to appeal to the appellate division from a decision or judgment of the superior court and for such purpose shall be deemed to be an aggrieved party. No bond shall be required of the Division upon appeal. Upon the final determination of the case or proceeding, the Division shall enter an order in accordance with the determination. When an appeal has been entered to any judgment, order, or decision of the court below, no benefits shall be paid pending a final determination of the cause, except in those cases in which the final decision of the Division allowed benefits.

       Irrespective of any other provision of this Chapter, the Division may adopt minimum regulations necessary to provide for the payment of benefits to individuals promptly when due as required by section 303(a)(1) of the Social Security Act as amended (42 U.S.C.A., section 503(a)(1)).
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      An employer may file an attached claim under this subsection only if the employer has a positive credit balance in its account as determined under Article 2B of this Chapter. If an employer does not have a positive credit balance in its account, the employer must remit to the Division an amount equal to the amount necessary to bring the employer's negative credit balance to at least zero at the time the employer files the attached claim.
     </p>
     <p>
      No claim for benefits may be withdrawn by a claimant except upon the filing of a notice of withdrawal within 10 days from the earlier of mailing or delivery of his monetary determination to him and a finding of good cause by the Assistant Secretary or designee.

     <p>
      At any time within one year from the date of the making of an initial determination, the Division on its own initiative may reconsider such determination if it finds that an error in computation or identity has occurred in connection therewith or that additional wages pertinent to the claimant's benefit status have become available, or if such determination of benefit status was made as a result of a nondisclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact.
     </p>
     <p>
      Provided, any interested employer shall be allowed 10 days from the mailing or delivery of the notice of the filing of a claim against the employer's account, whichever first occurs, to file with the Division its protest of the claim in order to have the claim referred to an adjudicator for a decision on the question or issue raised. Any protest filed must contain a basis for the protest and supporting statement of facts, and the protest may not be amended after the 10-day period from the mailing or delivery of the notice of filing of a claim has expired. No payment of benefits shall be made by the Division to a claimant until one of the following occurs:

     <p>
      Provided further, no question or issue may be raised or presented by the Division as to the eligibility of a claimant, or whether any disqualification should be imposed, after 45 days from the first day of the first week after the question or issue occurs with respect to which week an individual filed a claim for benefits. None of the provisions of this subsection shall have the force and effect nor shall the same be construed or interested as repealing any other provisions of G.S. 96-18.
     </p>
     <p>
      An employer shall receive written notice of the employer's appeal rights and any forms that are required to allow the employer to protest the claim. The forms shall include a section referencing the appropriate rules pertaining to appeals and the instructions on how to appeal.
     </p>

      All testimony at any hearing before an appeals referee upon a disputed claim shall be recorded unless the recording is waived by all interested parties. If the testimony is recorded, it need not be transcribed unless the disputed claim is further appealed and, one or more of the parties objects, under such rules as the Division may adopt, to being provided a copy of the tape recording of the hearing. Any other provisions of this Chapter notwithstanding, any individual receiving the transcript shall pay to the Division such reasonable fee for the transcript as the Division may by rule provide. The fee so prescribed by the Division for a party shall not exceed the lesser of sixty-five cents (65

   ) per page or sixty-five dollars ($65.00) per transcript. The Division may by regulation provide for the fee to be waived in such circumstances as it in its sole discretion deems appropriate but in the case of an appeal in forma pauperis supported by such proofs as are required in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01s0Va09s1-110" target="_blank">G.S. 1-110</a></cite>, the Division shall waive the fee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The parties may enter into a stipulation of the facts. If the appeals referee, hearing officer, or other employee assigned to make the decision believes the stipulation provides sufficient information to make a decision, then the appeals referee, hearing officer, or other employee assigned to make the decision may accept the stipulation and render a decision based on the stipulation. If the appeals referee, hearing officer, or other employee assigned to make the decision does not believe the stipulation provides sufficient information to make a decision, then the appeals referee, hearing officer, or other employee assigned to make the decision must reject the stipulation. The decision to accept or reject a stipulation must occur in a recorded hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      Within 45 days after receipt of the copy of the petition for review or within such additional time as the court may allow, the Division must transmit to the reviewing court the original or a certified copy of the entire record of the proceedings under review. With the permission of the court the record may be shortened by stipulation of all parties to the review proceedings. Any party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed by the court for the additional cost incurred by the refusal. The court may require or permit subsequent corrections or additions to the record when the court considers the changes desirable.

       The requirements of this section are mandatory
   
   and not directory. They are conditions precedent to obtaining a review by the courts and must be observed. Noncompliance therewith requires dismissal. In re State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 651</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 311 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In considering an appeal from a decision of the Employment Security Commission, the reviewing court must
   
   (1) determine whether there was evidence before the Commission to support its findings of fact and (2) decide whether the facts found sustain the Commission's conclusions of law and its resulting decision. Miller v. Guilford County Schools, <cite class="nc_code">62 N.C. App.</cite> 729, 303 S.E.2d 411, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 321</cite>, 307 S.E.2d 165 (1983).

       Appeal to Superior Court.
   
   - Under subsection (a) of G.S. 96-4 the chairman of the Employment Security Commission is vested with all authority of the Commission, and where it appears that a claim was heard on appeal by the chairman, and that claimant appealed therefrom "to the full Commission or to the superior court," the hearing of the appeal by the superior court was in accordance with the statute. State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 262</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 890 (1949).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employee's petition to review an unemployment compensation denial was properly dismissed because (1) G.S. 96-15(h) required the petition's actual delivery, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4, rather than mailing under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 5, as the statute required "certified mail, return receipt requested," emphasizing actual delivery and closely mirroring G.S. 1A-1, N.C. R. Civ. P. 4(j), and (2) the petition was not delivered. Isenberg v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 772 S.E.2d 97 (2015), review denied, 776 S.E.2d 849, 2015 N.C. LEXIS 987 (2015).

      <p>
       Appeal by Commission.
   
   - Under this section the exact status of the Commission as a party to an action is not defined and the part it is to play as such is left somewhat in the realm of speculation, and there is nothing which constitutes the Commission guardian or trustee for a claimant or which would warrant the conclusion that it is authorized to prosecute an appeal from a judgment against a claimant when the claimant is content. Nor may it do so for the purpose of adjudicating issues which are merely incidental to the claimant's cause of action. In re Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 65</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 476, 142 A.L.R. 931 (1941). But see G.S. 96-15(h) and (i).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       ESC as Employer with Appeal Rights.
   
   - The reasoning of the Court of Appeals erroneously treated Employment Security Commission (ESC) as an agency appealing its own agency decision rather than as an "aggrieved party" where ESC appealed to Superior Court not as an agency decision-maker, but as an employer aggrieved by the agency action. As ESC-employer was liable to pay for unemployment insurance benefits the same as any other employer and had the same rights of appeal as any other employer; thus ESC-employer had the status of "aggrieved party" under ESC Regulation 21.18(D) and had appeal rights as such. Employment Sec. Comm'n v. Peace, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 716</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 222 (1995).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Scope of Superior Court's Jurisdiction.
   
   - The superior court's jurisdiction in reviewing the Commission's decisions is severely limited. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243 S.E.2d 388 (1978). See also, In re Boulden, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 267 S.E.2d 397 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The function of the superior court in reviewing a decision of the Employment Security Commission is twofold: (1) To determine whether there was evidence before the Commission to support its findings of fact; and (2) to decide whether the facts found sustain the conclusions of law and the resultant decision of the Commission. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243 S.E.2d 388 (1978); Hester v. Hanes Knitwear, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 730, 301 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 676</cite>, 304 S.E.2d 755 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       The legislature, in granting jurisdiction under subsection (i) of this section to the superior court, intended the superior court to function as an appellate court. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243 S.E.2d 388 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that the superior court accepted additional evidence in hearing claimant's appeal from the decision of the Commission required a reversal of its decision. In re Enoch, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 243 S.E.2d 388 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in setting aside an agency's disqualification of a worker from receiving unemployment insurance benefits pursuant to G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed) based on the worker's refusal to work overtime; the worker failed to preserve for review his claim that procedural omissions by the agency violated his due process rights as required by G.S. 96-15(h). Graves v. Culp, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. App.</cite> 748, 603 S.E.2d 829 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trial court did not rule on the merits of an employee's claim for unemployment benefits, but found that the Employment Security Commission's order did not address all of the relevant issues raised by the record, and the findings were incomplete and failed to set out the sequence of events regarding the timing and notification of the employee's discharge, the order was clearly interlocutory; hence, without evidence that the employee's substantial rights were affected, or that any criteria for an immediate appeal was required, the employee's appeal was dismissed. Reeves v. Yellow Transp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 613 S.E.2d 350, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 853</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 511 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because a former employee made no exceptions to the findings made by the Employment Security Commission, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to consider that issue, and the trial court compounded its error by relying upon the appeals referee decision rendered in favor of a co-worker; the trial court erred in reversing the Commission. Woodle v. Onslow County ABC Bd., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 372, 631 S.E.2d 199 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of judicial review of appeals
   
   from decisions of the Employment Security Commission is a determination of whether the facts found by the Commission are supported by competent evidence and, if so, whether the findings support the conclusions of law. The reviewing court may not consider the evidence to find the facts itself. Baptist Children's Homes of N.C. Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 781, 290 S.E.2d 402 (1982); Phillips v. Kincaid Furn. Co., <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 313 S.E.2d 19 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The scope of appellate court review of decisions of the Commission is a determination of whether the facts found by the Commission are supported by competent evidence and, if so, whether the findings support the conclusions of law. Reco Transp., Inc. v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 344 S.E.2d 294, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 509</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 865 (1986).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in affirming a ruling by the Employment Security Division Board of Review that a police officer left work for a reason other than good cause attributable to the employer and was not entitled to unemployment benefits because the Board made two conflicting, subjective findings: that the officer did not believe he had left work and that his employer believed he did; made a number of evidentiary findings that conflicted with its ultimate finding; and did not state that it made the finding that the officer "left work and was not discharged by the employer" by applying a reasonable person standard. Maness v. Vill. of Pinehurst, - N.C. App.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 467 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal Held Timely Despite Late Filing.
   
   - Claimant's appeal from ruling of Employment Security Commission denying unemployment compensation was timely where, although the 30-day period ended July 7 and claimant's appeal was not filed until July 8, 1986, claimant received his copy of the petition, which was mailed on July 3, on July 5, 1986, and counsel for the employer received his copy on July 7, 1986; the failure of the petition to be marked "filed" in the clerk's office was through no fault of petitioner and any neglect was excusable. Edwards v. Milliken &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 379 S.E.2d 82 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court had authority to allow a late appeal
   
   from the adjudicator's determination; since the Commission's regulations allow it to grant extensions of time and to permit acts to be done after the expiration of the time allowed, the Commission's rulings were fully reviewable on appeal. Riddick v. Atlantic Veneer, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 201, 379 S.E.2d 661 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement of the grounds of the appeal
   
   formerly required by subsection (i) had to be filed within the time allowed for appeal. Its purpose was to give notice to the Commission and adverse parties of the alleged errors committed by the Commission and limit the scope of the hearing in the superior court to the specific questions of law raised by the errors assigned it. It was intended, and had to be construed, as a condition precedent to the right of appeal. Noncompliance therewith was fatal. In re State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 651</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 311 (1951).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusiveness of Findings of Fact on Appeal.
   
   - Upon appeal to the superior court from any final decision of the Commission, the findings of the Commission as to the facts, if supported by evidence, and in the absence of fraud, are conclusive, the jurisdiction of the superior court on appeal being limited to questions of law. In re Steelman, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 306</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 544, 135 A.L.R. 929 (1941); State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 381</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 403 (1950); In re Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 190</cite>, 130 S.E.2d 292, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, 375 U.S. 161, 84 S. Ct. 274, 11 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1963); In re Southern, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 544</cite>, 101 S.E.2d 327 (1958).
      </p>
      <p>
       The finding of the Commission that employee-claimants belonged to the same grade or class of workers as other employees, some of whom, immediately before the stoppage occurred, participated in and were directly interested in the labor dispute causing the stoppage, was supported by ample evidence and was therefore conclusive, there being no allegation or evidence of fraud. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 277</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 385 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       As the findings of fact made by the Commission, when supported by competent evidence, are conclusive and binding on the reviewing courts, which are to hear the appeal on questions of law only, the dismissal of the appeal in the court below for failure to file a statement of grounds as formerly required by subsection (i) deprived the claimants of no substantial right to which, otherwise, they might have been entitled. In re State ex rel. Emp. Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 651</cite>, 68 S.E.2d 311 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       The reviewing court under subsection (i) of this section may determine upon proper exceptions whether the facts found by the Commission were supported by competent evidence and whether the findings so supported sustain the legal conclusions and the award made, but in no event may the reviewing court consider the evidence for the purpose of finding the facts for itself. In re Boulden, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 267 S.E.2d 397 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings of fact by the Commission which are supported by competent evidence in the record are conclusive on appeal. Yelverton v. Kemp Furn. Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 215, 275 S.E.2d 553 (1981); Vanhorn v. Bassett Furn. Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 377, 333 S.E.2d 309 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when findings are not supported by the evidence, where there is no exception taken to such findings they are presumed to be supported by the evidence and are binding on appeal. Hagan v. Peden Steel Co., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 363, 291 S.E.2d 308 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on an employee's own testimony and documentary evidence that his failure to comply with the reasonable requirements of his job, specifically load and unload materials as directed and keep proper records, and because these requirements were reasonable and within his own control, the Employment Security Commission did not err by concluding that the employee was discharged for substantial fault and the trial court did not err by upholding this Commission's ruling. Reeves v. Yellow Transp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 613 S.E.2d 350, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 853</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 511 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior and appellate courts, under G.S. 96-15(i), were bound by the North Carolina Employment Security Commission's findings of fact because there was sufficient evidence to establish that the former employee missed work for medical reasons. James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court did not violate G.S. 96-15(i) by correcting an appeals referee's finding of fact because the finding of fact contained a mere misstatement by the referee of no consequence to the ultimate determination that an employee's discharge from employment with the employer was not due to substantial fault or misconduct in connection with the work. James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence of the former employee's stress related medical problems was sufficient to permit the North Carolina Employment Security Commission to determine that the employee's absences were for good cause and that she did give her employer appropriate notice regarding her absences; thereby defeating the employer's argument that the employee's absenteeism constituted misconduct under G.S. 96-14(2) (now repealed). James v. Lemmons, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 629 S.E.2d 324 (2006).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment Security Commission properly found that work-related misconduct was the basis of an employee's termination and properly denied unemployment benefits because the employee removed the hard drive from the employee's work computer and asserted a personal copyright interest in the employer's catalogs and web site without seeking and receiving permission, evidencing a deliberate disregard of standards of behavior which the employer had the right to expect of an employee. Binney v. Banner Therapy Prods., <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 310</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 717 (2008).
      </p>
      <p>
       Division of Employment Security properly determined, for purposes of an employee's claim for unemployment insurance benefits, that when the employer changed its vehicle policy for its employees, the employee had a personal vehicle that he could use to commute to work; the findings were supported by the evidence. King v. N.C. DOC, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 743 S.E.2d 83 (2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred as a matter of law in making conclusions of law which were not supported by the findings of fact adopted from the North Carolina Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security and thus, the trial court should have affirmed the decision of Department, denying unemployment benefits. Bailey v. Div. of Empl. Sec., <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 10, 753 S.E.2d 219 (2014).
   <br />

      <p>
       <b>
        Conclusion of Law.
       </b>
       - The conclusions of law of the North Carolina Department of Commerce, Division of Employment Security, are reviewed de novo. A determination that an employee's unemployment is due to misconduct connected with the work is a conclusion of law, and is therefore reviewed de novo. Burroughs v. Green Apple, LLC, - N.C. App.
   - , 832 S.E.2d 267 (2019).
      </p>
      <p>
       Deliberate Violation of Attendance Rules.
   
   - Most courts have held that persistent or chronic absences, at least where absences are without excuse or notice, and the employee has been given warnings by the employer, constitute misconduct within the meaning of the unemployment compensation laws. Obviously, when an employee is absent due to illness but fails to give proper notice the absence can amount to misconduct, not because of the illness per se but because the employee has an obligation to the employer to mitigate any damages an illness may cause the enterprise by giving appropriate notice. Butler v. J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 299 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 191</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 242 (1983).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where prior to the claimant's going on leave, she was on probation due to absence from work and tardiness in reporting to work; the employer had a known, reasonable policy that provided that medical leaves of absence can be granted or extended only upon the request of the employee's physician and the claimant was aware of this policy; and when the claimant reported back to work at the usual time she did not present a doctor's excuse for the previous day's absence, or to extend the leave of absence, the Commission could reasonably conclude that the claimant deliberately violated her employer's attendance rules. Therefore, the Commission's findings supported its conclusion that she had been discharged for "misconduct connected with her work." Davis v. Corning Glass Works, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 309 S.E.2d 258 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Good Faith Effort to Comply with Notification of Absence Rule.
   
   - Where claimant was absent four consecutive days after a twenty-month infraction-free period of employment, and a combination of unfortunate circumstances prevented claimant from meeting the strict requirements of his employer's rule regarding notification of absence, but the evidence from the record was clear that claimant made a good faith effort to comply with the rule, the facts and circumstances did not support the Employment Security Commission's finding of misconduct. Helmandollar v. M.A.N. Truck &amp; Bus Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 328 S.E.2d 43 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand by Deputy Commissioner.
   
   - Where the findings of the referee and the record together were insufficient to resolve certain issues in either party's favor, the deputy commissioner did not abuse his discretion in remanding for a new hearing. Williams v. Burlington Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 441</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 842 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Court of Appeals had authority to review deputy commissioner's decision to remand case
   
   for a second hearing. Williams v. Burlington Indus., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 441</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 842 (1986).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand Where Findings of Fact Supported But Insufficient.
   
   - If the findings of fact made by the Commission, even though supported by competent evidence in the record, are insufficient to enable the court to determine the rights of the parties upon the matters in controversy, the proceeding should be remanded to the end that the Commission make proper findings. In re Boulden, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 267 S.E.2d 397 (1980).

The BOR and its staff must perform their job responsibilities independent of the Governor, the General Assembly, the Department, and the Division and in accordance with any written guidance promulgated and issued by the U.S. Department of Labor.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-15.3ol1b">

The Governor may not resubmit the name of the nominee whom the General Assembly did not confirm for the office. If the Governor fails to timely submit a nomination, the General Assembly will appoint to fill the succeeding term as provided in subsection (e) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-15.3ol1d">
       Vacancies. - For the purpose of this subsection, the General Assembly is not in session only (i) prior to convening of the regular session, (ii) during any adjournment of the regular session for more than 10 days, and (iii) after sine die adjournment of the regular session. A vacancy in an office of the BOR prior to the expiration of the term of office must be filled in accordance with this subsection:
       <ol>
        <li id="t96a2Ds96-15.3ol1d1">
         During legislative session. - If a vacancy in an office arises or exists when the General Assembly is in session, the Governor must submit the name of the individual to be appointed to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term within 30 days after the vacancy arises to the General Assembly for confirmation by the General Assembly.

The Governor must submit the name of the individual to be appointed to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term to the General Assembly for confirmation within 14 days of the date the General Assembly convenes or reconvenes for the next regular session. If the Governor fails to timely submit a nomination, the General Assembly will appoint to fill the vacancy as provided in subsection (e) of this section.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-15.3ol1e">
       Legislative Appointments. - If the Governor fails to timely submit the name of an individual to be appointed to the BOR as provided in this section, then the General Assembly may appoint an individual to fill the vacancy in accordance with G.S. 120-121 and the provisions of this subsection. If the vacancy occurs in an odd-numbered year, the appointment is made upon the recommendation of the President Pro Tempore of the Senate. If the vacancy occurs in an even-numbered year, the appointment is made upon the recommendation of the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>

No individual may serve more than two terms on the BOR. In calculating the number of terms served, a partial term that is less than 24 months in length will not be included. The General Assembly must set the annual salaries of the BOR in the current Operations Appropriations Act.

      <li id="t96a2Ds96-16ol1a">
       A seasonal pursuit is one which, because of seasonal conditions making it impracticable or impossible to do otherwise, customarily carries on production operations only within a regularly recurring active period or periods of less than an aggregate of 36 weeks in a calendar year. No pursuit shall be deemed seasonal unless and until so found by the Division; except that any successor under G.S. 96-11.7 to a seasonal pursuit shall be deemed seasonal unless such successor shall within 120 days after the acquisition request cancellation of the determination of status of such seasonal pursuit; provided further that this provision shall not be applicable to pending cases nor retroactive in effect.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-16ol1b">
       Upon application therefor by a pursuit, the Division shall determine or redetermine whether such pursuit is seasonal and, if seasonal, the active period or periods thereof. The Division may, on its own motion, redetermine the active period or periods of a seasonal pursuit. An application for a seasonal determination must be made on forms prescribed by the Division and must be made at least 20 days prior to the beginning date of the period of production operations for which a determination is requested.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-16ol1c">
       Whenever the Division has determined or redetermined a pursuit to be seasonal, such pursuit shall be notified immediately, and such notice shall contain the beginning and ending dates of the pursuit's active period or periods. Such pursuits shall display notices of its seasonal determination conspicuously on its premises in a sufficient number of places to be available for inspection by its workers. Such notices shall be furnished by the Division.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-16ol1d">
       A seasonal determination shall become effective unless an interested party files an application for review within 10 days after the beginning date of the first period of production operations to which it applies. Such an application for review shall be deemed to be an application for a determination of status, as provided in G.S. 96-4, subsections (q) through (u) of this Chapter, and shall be heard and determined in accordance with the provisions thereof.

The penalty applies to an erroneous payment made under any State program providing for the payment of unemployment compensation as well as an erroneous payment made under any federal program providing for the payment of unemployment compensation. The notice of determination or decision advising the person that benefits have been denied or adjusted pursuant to subsection (e) of this section must include the reason for the finding of an erroneous payment, the penalty amount assessed under this subsection, and the reason the penalty has been applied.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      G.S. 105-236(9a) applies to a "contribution tax return preparer" to the same extent as it applies to an income tax preparer. As used in this subsection, a "contribution tax return preparer" is a person who prepares for compensation, or who employs one or more persons to prepare for compensation, any return of tax imposed by this Chapter or any claim for refund of tax imposed by this Chapter. For purposes of this definition, the completion of a substantial portion of a return or claim for refund is treated as the preparation of the return or claim for refund. The term does not include a person merely because the person (i) furnishes typing, reproducing, or other mechanical assistance, (ii) prepares a return or claim for refund of the employer, or an officer or employee of the employer, by whom the person is regularly and continuously employed, (iii) prepares as a fiduciary a return or claim for refund for any person, or (iv) represents a taxpayer in a hearing regarding a proposed assessment.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty in G.S. 105-236(7) applies with respect to unemployment insurance contributions under this Chapter only when one of the following circumstances exist in connection with the violation:
     </p>
     <p>
      If none of the circumstances set forth in subdivision (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection exist in connection with a violation of G.S. 105-236(7) applied under this Chapter, the offender is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor and each day the violation continues constitutes a separate offense.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Division finds that any person violated G.S. 105-236(9a) and is not subject to a fraud penalty, the person shall pay a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation for each day the violations continue, plus the reasonable costs of investigation and enforcement.
     </p>
     <p>
      The penalty amount may be collected in any manner allowed for the recovery of the erroneous payment, except that the penalty amount may not be recovered through offsets of future benefits. When a recovery with respect to an erroneous payment is made, any recovery applies first to the principal of the erroneous payment, then to the federally mandated penalty amount imposed under this subsection, and finally to any other amounts due.

     <p>
      "It is the desire of the General Assembly for the State to participate in the Unemployment Insurance Compensation Debt Program on or before January 1, 2013.

       Attachment and Garnishment. - Intangible property that belongs to an individual, is owed to an individual, or has been transferred by an individual under circumstances that would permit it to be levied upon if it were tangible property is subject to attachment and garnishment in payment of a fraudulent overpayment that is due from the individual and is collectible under this Article. Intangible personal property includes bank deposits, rent, salaries, wages, property held in the Escheat Fund, and any other property incapable of manual levy or delivery.
      </li>
      <li id="t96a2Ds96-18.1ol1c">
       Notice. - Before the Secretary attaches and garnishes intangible property in payment of a fraudulent overpayment, the Secretary must send the garnishee a notice of garnishment. The notice must be sent either in person, by certified mail with a return receipt requested, or with the agreement of the garnishee, by electronic means. The notice must contain all of the following information:
       <ol>

       Action. - A garnishee must comply with a notice of garnishment or file a written response to the notice within the time set in this subsection. A garnishee that is a financial institution must comply or file a response within 20 days after receiving a notice of garnishment. All other garnishees must comply or file a response within 30 days after receiving a notice of garnishment. A written response must explain why the garnishee is not subject to garnishment and attachment.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      A person who is in possession of intangible property that is subject to attachment and garnishment is the garnishee and is liable for the amount the individual owes. The liability applies only to the amount of the individual's property in the garnishee's possession, reduced by any amount the individual owes the garnishee.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary may submit to a financial institution, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.053B.html#t53Bs53B-2" target="_blank">G.S. 53B-2</a></cite>, information that identifies an individual who owes a fraudulent overpayment that is collectible under this section and the amount of the overpayment. The Secretary may submit the information on a quarterly basis or, with the agreement of the financial institution, on a more frequent basis. A financial institution that receives the information must determine the amount, if any, of intangible property it holds that belongs to the individual and must inform the Secretary of its determination. The Secretary must reimburse a financial institution for its costs in providing the information, not to exceed the amount payable to the financial institution under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-139" target="_blank">G.S. 110-139</a></cite> for providing information for use in locating a noncustodial parent.
     </p>
     <p>
      No more than ten percent (10%) of an individual's wages or salary is subject to attachment and garnishment. The wages or salary of an employee of the United States, the State, or a political subdivision of the State are subject to attachment and garnishment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Upon receipt of a written response, the Department must contact the garnishee and schedule a conference to discuss the response or inform the garnishee of the Department's position concerning the response. If the Department does not agree with the garnishee on the garnishee's liability, the Department may proceed to enforce the garnishee's liability for the fraudulent overpayment of unemployment benefits by civil action.

      <li id="t96a2Ds96-19ol1a">
       It is the purpose of this Chapter to secure for employers and employees the benefits of Title III and Title IX of the Federal Social Security Act, approved August 14, 1935, as to credit on payment of federal taxes, of State contributions, the receipt of federal grants for administrative purposes, and all other provisions of the said Federal Social Security Act; and it is intended as a policy of the State that this Chapter and its requirements for contributions by employers shall continue in force only so long as such employers are required to pay the federal taxes imposed in said Federal Social Security Act by a valid act of Congress. Therefore, if Title III and Title IX of the said Federal Social Security Act shall be declared invalid by the United States Supreme Court, or if such law be repealed by congressional action so that the federal tax cannot be further levied, from and after the declaration of such invalidity by the United States Supreme Court, or the repeal of said law by congressional action, as the case may be, no further levy or collection of contributions shall be made hereunder. The enactment by the Congress of the United States of the Railroad Retirement Act and the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act shall in no way affect the administration of this law except as herein expressly provided.

After complete payment of all administrative costs and full payment of all awards made as aforesaid, any and all moneys remaining to the credit of any employer shall be refunded to such employer, or his duly authorized assignee: Provided, that the State employment service, created by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.106.html" target="_blank">Chapter 106</a></cite>, Public Laws of 1935, and transferred by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a></cite>, Public Laws of 1936, Extra Session, and made a part of the former Employment Security Commission of North Carolina, and that is now part of the Division of Employment Security of the North Carolina Department of Commerce, shall in such event return to and have the same status as it had prior to enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a></cite>, Public Laws of 1936, Extra Session, and under authority of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.106.html" target="_blank">Chapter 106</a></cite>, Public Laws of 1935, shall carry on the duties therein prescribed; but, pending a final settlement of the affairs of the Division, the said State employment service shall render such service in connection therewith as shall be demanded or required under the provisions of this Chapter or the provisions of Chapter 1, Public Laws of 1936, Extra Session.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds it in the best interests of this State that the establishment, maintenance, and funding of State job training, education, and placement programs be based on current, comprehensive information on the effectiveness of these programs in securing employment for North Carolina citizens and providing a well-trained workforce for business and industry in this State. To this end, it is the purpose of this Article to require the establishment of an information system that maintains up-to-date job-related information on current and former participants in State job training and education programs.
