                    The purpose of this Article is to provide a system of State trademark registration and protection substantially consistent with the federal system of trademark registration and protection under the Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. § 1051, et seq., as
                    amended. The construction given the federal act should be examined as persuasive authority for interpreting and construing this Article.

                        When Relief Granted. - Before the owner of a trademark can call upon the courts for relief, he must show not only that he has a clear legal right to the trademark, but that there has been a plain violation of it; and where a violation is alleged, the
                        true inquiry is, whether the mark of the defendant is so assimilated to that of the plaintiff as to deceive purchasers. And it will make no difference whether the party designed to mislead the public or whether the symbol adopted
                        was calculated to deceive. Blackwell v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 310</cite> (1875), aff'd on rehearing, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 733</cite> (1876).

                        If it appears that the trademark alleged to be an imitation, though resembling the complainant's in some respects, would not probably deceive the ordinary mass of purchasers, an injunction will not be granted. An imitation is colorable, and will be enjoined,
                        which requires a careful inspection to distinguish its mark and appearance from that of the manufacture imitated. Blackwell v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 310</cite> (1875), aff'd on rehearing,
