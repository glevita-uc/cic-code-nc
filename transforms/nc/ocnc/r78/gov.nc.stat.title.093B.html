    <b>
     Encourage Certain Occupational Licensing Boards to Develop Policies for Expediting the Licensing Process for Military Spouses.
    </b>
    - Session Laws 2005-445, ss. 2.1 and 2.2, provide: "Section 2.1. Findings. - The General Assembly finds that:
   </p>
   <p>
    "(1) According to the Department of Defense, the unemployment rate of military spouses is three times greater than the average American spouse in the same age group;
   </p>
   <p>
    "(2) The mobile military lifestyle causes some military spouses to endure long periods of unemployment and, thus, loss of income; and
   </p>
   <p>
    "(3) Professional licensing requirements often differ among states, which in turn may limit career advancement or deter reentry into the workforce for military families moving to new locations.
   </p>
   <p>
    "In an effort to support military personnel and their families, each occupational licensing board in this State is encouraged to develop policies that would make the licensing process for military spouses more efficient and expedient. In expediting the licensing process, an occupational licensing board shall review its current licensing process especially as it relates to military personnel. After reviewing the licensing process, the licensing board may develop and implement policies regarding licensure that provide for assistance to military spouses and dependents to ensure a smooth process when military families move into this State or are transferred out of this State. Implementation of these policies shall not apply to occupational licensing boards regulating health care professionals.
   </p>
   <p>
    "This section does not apply to health professions or to teaching."
   </p>
   <p>
    Session Laws 2013-413, s. 10(a), (b), provides: "The Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee shall include in the 2013-2014 Work Plan for the Program Evaluation Division of the General Assembly a study to evaluate the structure, organization, and operation of the various independent occupational licensing boards. For purposes of this act, the term 'occupational licensing board' has the same meaning as defined in G.S. 93B-1. The Program Evaluation Division shall include the following within this study:
   </p>
   <p>
    "(1) Consideration of the feasibility of establishing a single State agency to oversee the administration of all or some of the occupational licensing boards.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(2) Whether greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness can be realized by combining the administrative functions of the boards while allowing the boards to continue performing the regulatory functions.
   </p>
   <p>
    "(3) Whether the total number of boards should be reduced by combining and/or eliminating some boards."
   </p>
   <p>
    "(b) The Program Evaluation Division shall submit its findings and recommendations from Section 10(a) of this act to the Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee and the Joint Legislative Administrative Procedure Oversight Committee at a date to be determined by the Joint Legislative Program Evaluation Oversight Committee."

This petition shall include a criminal history record report obtained by the individual from a reporting service designated by the board, the cost of which shall be borne by the applicant.

No board member having served on a predetermination committee for an individual shall be required to recuse in any later determinations or hearings involving the same applicant. The board shall inform the individual of the board's determination within 45 days of receiving the petition from the individual. The board may charge a fee to recoup its costs not to exceed forty-five dollars ($45.00) for each petition.
