                <p>
                    Whereas, lawful oaths for discovery of truth and establishing right are necessary and highly conducive to the important end of good government; and being most solemn appeals to Almighty God, as the omniscient witness of truth and the just and omnipotent
                    avenger of falsehood, and whereas, lawful affirmations for the discovery of truth and establishing right are necessary and highly conducive to the important end of good government, therefore, such oaths and affirmations ought to be
                    taken and administered with the utmost solemnity.

                        The "solemnity" applies not only to the substance of the oath, but to the form and manner of taking it and of administering it. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C. 383</cite> (1873).

                        Double Sanction to Oath of Witness. - The law requires two guarantees of the truth of what a witness is about to state; he must be in the fear of punishment by the laws of man, and he must also be in the fear of punishment by the laws of God, if he states
                        what is false; in other words, there must be a temporal and also a religious sanction to his oath. Shaw v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 25</cite> (1856).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sufficiency of Belief. - A person who believes in the obligation of an oath on the Bible; who believes in God and Jesus Christ, and that God will punish in this world, all violators of his law, and that the sinner will inevitably be punished in this world
                        for each and every sin committed; but who believes that there will be no punishment after death, and that in another world all will be happy and equal to the angels, is competent to be sworn. Shaw v. Moore,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">49 N.C. 25</cite> (1856).

                    <p>
                        In Omychund v. Barker, 1 Atk. 19, and Wiles, 538, it was decided that a Gentoo, who did not believe in either the Old or New Testament, but who believed in a God, as the Creator of the Universe, and believed that he was a rewarder of those who do well,
                        and an avenger of those who do ill, according to the common law, could be sworn in that form which was the most sacred and obligatory upon his religious sense. The case established the rule to be, that an infidel is competent to
                        be sworn, provided he believes in the existence of a Supreme Being, who punishes the wicked, without reference to the time of punishment. Shaw v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 25</cite> (1856).

                        Finding of the Judge Conclusive. - The finding of the judge as to the competency of a witness to take an oath is conclusive, and not reviewable. State v. Pitt, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 268</cite>, 80 S.E. 1060 (1914).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Objection to Manner of Administering After Verdict. - Where a juror was sworn in the presence of the defendant, and his counsel let him acquiesce in the manner in which the oath was taken, to permit him to object after the verdict would simply make a
                        trial not a decision upon the merits but a series of pitfalls for the State. Not having spoken when he was called upon to speak, the prisoner would not be heard after the verdict has gone against him. State v. Ward,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">9 N.C. 443</cite> (1823); Briggs v. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. 377</cite> (1851); State v. Patrick, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. 443</cite> (1856); State v. Boon, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 637</cite> (1880); State
                            v. Council, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 511</cite>, 39 S.E. 814 (1901).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Administer. - In State v. Gee, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 756</cite> (1885), where a witness was not sworn at all, the court held that this was not ground of objection after verdict. State v. Council, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 511</cite>,
                        39 S.E. 814 (1901).

                    <p>
                        Objection to Oath of Incompetent After Verdict. - Where a juror was incompetent to be sworn because he was an atheist (State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. 412</cite> (1879)) and the objection was not discovered till after
                        verdict, setting aside the verdict rested in the discretion of the trial judge. State v. Lamber, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 618</cite> (1885); State v. Council, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 511</cite>, 39 S.E. 814 (1901).

                <p>
                    Judges and other persons who may be empowered to administer oaths, shall (except in the cases in this Chapter excepted) require the party to be sworn to lay his hand upon the Holy Scriptures, in token of his engagement to speak the truth and in further
                    token that, if he should swerve from the truth, he may be justly deprived of all the blessings of that holy book and made liable to that vengeance which he has imprecated on his own head.

                    <p>
                        Sufficiency of Juror's Oath. - An oath administered to a juror in the manner prescribed by statute is sufficient; the juror need not repeat the words "so help me God." State v. Paylor, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 539</cite> (1883).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Ministerial Act. - The administration of an oath is a ministerial act and may be done by anyone in the presence and by the direction of the court, but is the act of the court. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 789</cite>                        (1881).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Partially Directory. - As to the form of the oath, when it is prescribed by statute, the statute is to be construed in some sense as directory only, so far at least that a departure from the words, in matter not of substance but of form merely, does not
                        exempt the person taking it from the pains of perjury. State v. Mazon, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 676</cite> (1884).

                    <p>
                        Validity of Irregular Oath. - To hold invalid an oath that did not follow the very words of the statute could prove disastrous to the public interests. State v. Mazon, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 676</cite> (1884).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Swearing on the Quran. - Superior court erred in dismissing a complaint challenging G.S. 11-2 for lack of a justiciable controversy where an individual brought a declaratory judgment after her request to swear on the Quran was denied and an organization
                        had sued after its Jewish members exhibited their intent to serve as jurors or witnesses if called. ACLU of N.C. Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 430, 639 S.E.2d 136 (2007).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Juror's Oath in Capital Cases. - Although the omission of the words "you swear" at the commencement of the oath of jurors in a capital case looks awkward and mars the comeliness of judicial proceedings, it does not vitiate the oath. State v. Owen,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">72 N.C. 605</cite> (1875).

                    He shall stand with his right hand lifted up towards heaven, in token of his solemn appeal to the Supreme God, and also in token that if he should swerve from the truth he would draw down the vengeance of heaven upon his head, and

                        Conscientious Scruples. - If the usual form of oaths upon the Holy Evangelists is dispensed with and an "appeal" or "affirmation" is substituted, it must appear that the person sworn had conscientious scruples, or else the "appeal" or "affirmation" is

                        Presumption as to Witness. - When a witness comes before a tribunal to be sworn it is to be presumed that he has settled the point with himself in what manner he will be sworn, and he should make it known to the officer of the court; and should he be
                        sworn with uplifted hand, though not conscientiously scrupulous of swearing on the Gospels, and depose falsely, he subjects himself to the pains and penalties of perjury. State v. Whisenhurst, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. 458</cite>                        (1823).

                        oath was taken with uplifted hand, as specified by this section, and was accepted as a valid mode of administering it, by both the registrar and the elector. Administering the oath in such manner was sufficient to meet the requirements

                        Disclosures Not Prohibited by Grand Jurors' Oath. - The grand jurors' oath of secrecy does not prohibit the disclosure in court of proceedings before the grand jury whenever the ends of justice require it. State v. Colson,

                        Action of the grand jury in returning two fictitious bills of indictment charging undercover agents with narcotics violations, including the undercover agent who was the principal witness against defendant, was improper, but did not necessarily taint
                        all processes of that grand jury so as to require as a matter of law that a bill of indictment charging defendant with transportation of marijuana be quashed. State v. Long, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite>                        508, 188 S.E.2d 690 (1972).

                        Jury Need Not Be Resworn for Prosecution of Less Than Capital Offense. - Where, upon an indictment charging homicide, the solicitor (now district attorney) announced that he was not seeking a higher verdict than murder in the second degree, the prosecution
                        was no longer for a capital offense, and it was not required that the jury be again sworn to try the particular prosecution, but under the provisions of this section it was sufficient that the jurors and all others summoned as
                        jurors for the session of court were administered an oath to truly try all issues which would come before the jury during the term. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 659</cite>, 151 S.E.2d 596
