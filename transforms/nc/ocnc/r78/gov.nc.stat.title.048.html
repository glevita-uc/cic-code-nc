                        Constitutionality. - Biological father's substantive due process rights under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions were not violated because the father made very few efforts after the birth of the child to develop a parent-child relationship.
                        As such, he did not fall within the class of protected fathers who could claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with the child, his consent to the adoption of the child was not necessary, and the adoption chapter
                        was not unconstitutional as applied to the father. Robinson v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 308, 767 S.E.2d 395 (2014).

                        District court in North Carolina is without authority to confer parental status upon a person who is not the biological parent of a child. The sole means of creating the legal relationship of parent and child is pursuant to the provisions of
                        <cite
                            class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite> of the General Statutes (Adoptions), G.S. 48-1-100 et seq. Heatzig v. MacLean, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 664 S.E.2d 347 (2008), review

                    <p>
                        Strict Construction. - Under this Chapter as it formerly stood, it was held that since the laws of inheritance and distribution of property are directly involved in an adoption proceeding, and since the proceeding is in derogation of the common law, it
                        must be strictly construed. In re Holder, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 136</cite>, 10 S.E.2d 620 (1940).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the adoption statute is in derogation of the common law and works a change in the canons of descent, it must be construed strictly and not so as to enlarge or confer any rights not clearly given. Crumpton v. Crumpton,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 221 S.E.2d 390, vacated on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 651</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 587 (1976). See also, Crumpton v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 657</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 1 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Construction Should Be Fair and Reasonable. - The right of adoption is not only beneficial to those immediately concerned, but likewise to the public, and construction of the statute should not be narrow or technical, but rather fair and reasonable, where
                        all material provisions of the statute have been complied with. Locke v. Merrick, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 799</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 523 (1944).

                        North Carolina recognizes the doctrine of equitable adoption. Lankford v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 115</cite>, 489 S.E.2d 604 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Equitable Adoption. - Equitable adoption, does not confer the incidents of formal statutory adoption; rather, it merely confers rights of inheritance upon the foster child in the event of intestacy of the foster parents. Lankford v. Wright,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">347 N.C. 115</cite>, 489 S.E.2d 604 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Applicable Rules of Civil Procedure. - The Rules of Civil Procedure, G.S. 1A-1, and the provisions of G.S. 1-393 et seq. apply to adoption proceedings. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989),

                    <p>
                        Juvenile Court Act Not an Amendment. - The Juvenile Court Act was not an amendment to the former adoption law, and did not affect the procedure therein prescribed for the adoption of minors. Ward v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 201</cite>,
                        7 S.E.2d 625 (1940).

                        An agreement to adopt a minor, made between the person desiring to adopt the minor and the minor's parents, as the respective parties to the agreement, was not an adoption of a minor under the former Chapter. Chambers v. Byers,

                        Consent Not Procured by Fraud. - Adoptive father's attempt to void his consent to the adoption of his wife's daughter based on fraud failed, because the adoptive father failed to prove that the wife made any misrepresentations with regard to any alleged
                        plans on her part to separate or divorce; based on the wife telling the adoptive father of her unhappiness and the couple's frequent arguments with regard to the adoptive father's drug use, the adoptive father knew or should have
                        known that there was some possibility that the parties would separate. Fakhoury v. Fakhoury, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 613 S.E.2d 729, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 62</cite>,

                            Conclusiveness of Proceedings Under Former G.S. 48-6. - Under former G.S. 48-6, it was held that adoption proceedings are conclusive as to persons who were parties thereto and as to their privies, notwithstanding a defect as to a party who would be entitled
                            to disregard them as not binding on him, but who does not complain of his nonjoinder. Locke v. Merrick, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 799</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 523 (1944). See G.S. 48-28.

                            Adopted Child Acquires Only Rights Declared by Statute. - The rights which a child acquires by adoption are those and only those declared by legislative act. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 531</cite>,
                            142 S.E.2d 182 (1965).

                            Adoption Petition Failed to Invoke Court's Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - Adoption decree was invalid because the non-parent was seeking relief that was unavailable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>                            of the General Statutes, as she sought an adoption decree that would establish the legal relationship of parent and child with the minor child but not sever that same relationship between the minor child and his biological
                            mother under G.S. 48-1-106(c) and G.S. 48-3-606(9), and therefore the adoption petition did not invoke the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction under G.S. 48-2-100; as a result, the adoption decree was void ab initio.
                            Boseman v. Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 537</cite>, 704 S.E.2d 494 (2010).

                            Severance of legal ties with the child's natural family was not intended to be partial; rather, former G.S. 48-6 means that upon a final order of adoption the severance of legal ties with the child's natural family is total. The child acquires full status
                            as a member of his adoptive family and in so doing is for all legal purposes removed from his natural bloodline. Crumpton v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 657</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 1 (1981).

                            Those Adopted Out of a Family Are Not "Issue" Thereof. - In enacting former G.S. 48-6, the legislature contemplated that upon a final order of adoption a complete substitution of family would take place, with the adopted child becoming the child of his
                            adoptive parents and a member of their family, and the legal relationship with the child's natural parents and family being by virtue of the adoption order completely severed; therefore, those adopted out of a family may not
                            take as "issue" of that family under a deed granting a remainder to issue. Crumpton v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 657</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 1 (1981).

                            Adopted Child Becomes a Stranger to the Bloodline of His Natural Parents. - By adoption, the adopted child becomes legally the child of the adoptive parents and becomes legally a stranger to the bloodline of his natural parents. Acker v. Barnes,

                        <p>
                            The General Assembly evidenced its intent that by adoption the child adopted becomes legally a child of his new parents, and the adoption makes him legally a stranger to the bloodline of his natural parents. Crumpton v. Mitchell,

                                class="nc_code">303 N.C. 657</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 1 (1981).

                            Adoption Terminates Rights of Natural Parents. - A final decree of adoption for life terminates the relationship between the natural parents and the child, and the natural parents are divested of all rights with respect to the child. Rhodes v. Henderson,
                            <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 404, 188 S.E.2d 565 (1972).

                        <p>
                            The right of the natural mother after she has permitted the child's adoption by others is no greater than that of a stranger to the child. Rhodes v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 404, 188 S.E.2d 565 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A natural parent who has consented to the adoption of his or her children cannot thereafter bring an action against the natural parent and adoptive parent for custody or visitation of the children. Kelly v. Blackwell,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 468 S.E.2d 400 (1996).

                        <p>
                            Prior Termination of Parental Rights Not Necessary. - While termination of a putative father's rights may precede an adoption petition, prior termination of his rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite>                            is not necessary if, under the applicable provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>, his consent to the adoption is not necessary; his parental rights
                            are then terminated by the final order of adoption under former G.S. 48-23. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>,

                            Prerogative of Adoptive Parents to Determine with Whom Children Associate. - Dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted was proper where the paternal grandmother and natural aunt of children legally adopted by present husband
                            of the natural mother sought visitation rights, since parents with lawful custody of minor children retain the prerogative to determine with whom their children shall associate. Acker v. Barnes,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 750, 236 S.E.2d 715, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 360</cite>, 238 S.E.2d 149 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Adoption by Stepparent. - The language of former G.S. 48-7(d), that adoption by a stepparent does not affect the parent-child relationship with the natural parent, is a measure to protect that parent-child relationship from the otherwise sweeping effects
                            of former 48-23(1), which otherwise might be construed to terminate the natural parent-child relationship. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985),
                            aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913 (1986).

                            Adopted Children as Lineal Descendants Under Former G.S. 30-3(b). - Natural children of one spouse born during a previous marriage, if adopted by second spouse with consent of their surviving natural parent, were considered lineal descendants by the second
                            marriage for purposes of former G.S. 30-3(b), which determined a dissenting spouse's share. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd,

                            Collateral Attack on Adoption by Party Thereto. - The provisions of former G.S. 48-28 would prevent a collateral attack by husband on adoption of wife's child, where he was a party to the proceeding. Andrews v. Andrews,

                            Father's Pre-adoption Obligation to Provide Support Not Affected. - In the absence of evidence that the mother waived her right to past due payments, nothing about his childrens' subsequent adoption affected a father's pre-adoption obligation to provide
                            support for his children, and nothing about the subsequent adoption affected the applicable statute of limitations. State ex rel. Pruitt v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 713,

                            Domestic partner was a legal parent of a child because the parties' adoption was a direct placement adoption with a waiver of the full terms of parental consent and legal obligations specified in G.S. 48-1-106(c) and G.S. 48-3-606, and under G.S. 48-2-607(a),
                            a biological mother, as a party to the adoption, could not question its validity based on any defect or irregularity, jurisdictional or otherwise. Boseman v.

                            Right of Adopted Child to Inherit - Generally. - The legislature has provided that an adopted child, from the date of its adoption, shall have the same property rights as a natural born child from the date of its birth. Headen v. Jackson,

                            Taken in conjunction with each other, subdivisions (1) and (3) of former G.S. 48-23 gave an adopted person the right to succeed to the estate of the adoptive parent upon intestacy, and to take under the will of the adoptive parent if the parent so provides.
                            This result comes from a recognition of the absolute necessity, given the prevalence of adoptions in modern society, that adoption effect a complete substitution of families. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Chambless,

                            Right of Adopted Child to Inherit - Former Law. - Under former G.S. 48-6, as it stood prior to the 1941 amendment, the effect of adoption was simply to create a personal status between the adoptive parent and the child adopted, so that the adopted child
                            might inherit from the adoptive parent such estate of the adoptive parent as such parent, during his lifetime, might voluntarily have given to such child. Phillips v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 438</cite>,

                            Under former G.S. 48-6, as it stood prior to the 1941 amendment, the adopted child could not inherit through the adoptive parent or from any source other than the "estate of the petitioner." The right to inherit was limited to the property of the adoptive
                            parent, and the adopted child could not inherit from his father's ancestors or other kindred or be a representative of them. Grimes v. Grimes, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 778</cite>, 178 S.E.

                            Right of Adopted Child to Inherit - Effect of 1955 Act. - Any provision of law which prevented an adopted child from sharing in property by descent or distribution in the same manner and to the same extent as a natural born child was swept away by the
                            repealing clause in Session Laws 1955, c. 813. Headen v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 157</cite>, 120 S.E.2d 598 (1961).

                            Under the provisions of Session Laws 1955, c. 813, s. 6, an adopted child is entitled to inherit property from the brother of the adopting parent, notwithstanding that the decree of adoption was entered prior to the passage of the statute, the legislature
                            having the power to determine who shall take the property of a person dying subsequent to the effective date of a legislative act. Bennett v. Cain, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 428</cite>, 103

                            natural parents, to embrace not only intestate succession but also property passing under deeds, grants, wills or other written instruments. Crumpton v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 657</cite>,

                            Former G.S. 48-23(3) (see now subsection (e)) does not abolish the rule that the intent of the testator controls the construction of his will. Peele v. Finch, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 375</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 635 (1973);
                            Crumpton v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 657</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 1 (1981).

                        <p>
                            It is well established that the cardinal principle in the construction of a will is to give effect to the intent of the testator as it appears from the language used in the instrument itself, subject to the limits imposed by statute or decision. Former
                            G.S. 48-23(3) (see now subsection (e)) had not changed this principle, but has merely provided the courts with a clear and certain rule of construction to be applied unless a contrary intent plainly appears from the terms of
                            the instrument. Stoney v. MacDougall, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 678, 230 S.E.2d 592 (1976), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 716</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 208 (1977).

                        <p>
                            Whether an adopted child would take under the will of her adoptive mother's father depended upon whether she was "issue" of her parent within the meaning of the will. Peele v. Finch, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 375</cite>,

                            Rule of Construction in Former G.S. 48-23(3) (See Now Subsection (e)) Applies Irrespective of When Will Was Executed. - It is expressly provided by this section that the rule of construction in former G.S. 48-23(3) (see now subsection (e)) shall apply
                            whether the will was executed before or after the final order of adoption and irrespective of whether the will was executed before or after the enactment of this section. Stoney v. MacDougall,

                            Inclusion of Adopted Child - In Term "Descendant." - Former G.S. 48-23(3) (see now subsection (e)), in providing that "descendant" includes any adopted person "unless the contrary plainly appears by the terms thereof" provides a clear and certain rule
                            of construction to be applied unless a contrary intent plainly appears from the terms of the instrument. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Chambless, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 95,

                            Inclusion of Adopted Child - In Term "Issue." - The express provision of this section is that in any will the word "issue" shall be held to include any adopted person, unless the contrary plainly appears by the terms of the will itself. Stoney v. MacDougall,
                            <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 220 S.E.2d 368 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 302</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 702 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Use of the words "my issue" in a will executed prior to this section was not a plain indication of a contrary intent sufficient to prevent the adopted children of an heir from sharing in the distribution of the principal upon termination of the trust
                            created by the will. Stoney v. MacDougall, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 220 S.E.2d 368 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 302</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 702 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where nothing in the devise made by a will throws any light whatever upon testator's intent, courts must by this section hold that an adopted child is "issue" within the meaning of this will and takes thereunder a share in the proceeds of the land devised.
                            Peele v. Finch, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 375</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 635 (1973).

                        <p>
                            The mere use of the word "issue" in an instrument drafted prior to the enactment of former G.S. 48-23(3) (see now subsection (e)) does not plainly reveal the contrary intent required by this section. Stoney v. MacDougall,

                            Right of Adopted Children to Take Under Trust. - The terms of this section, which are applied retroactively, give adopted children the same rights as natural children; thus, the adopted children of the settlor's daughter were entitled to take as "issue"
                            or "descendants" under an irrevocable inter vivos trust, where no intention to exclude them appeared in the terms of the instrument. Gibbons v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 777,

                            In determining whether adopted children shared in the distribution of a trust, the court was precluded by this section from considering a purported gift of stock made by the trust settlor to the adopted children, allegedly because of the settlor's mistaken
                            assumption that the adoptees could not take as "issue" or "descendants." Gibbons v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 513 S.E.2d 834 (1999).

                            Will Indicating Intent to Exclude Adopted Children. - Where a trust provided benefits for named blood relatives of testator, with provision that this number could be increased only in the event that great nieces and great nephews were born within 21 years
                            after testator's death, the will clearly indicated testator's intent to exclude children adopted by his nieces and nephews from the benefits, and therefore this section, by its express language, did not apply, and the children
                            adopted by testator's nieces and nephews would not take under the will. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 531</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 182 (1965).

                            Antilapse Statute Applied to Adopted Child of Legatee. - Where a parent by adoption was named a legatee in the will of her mother, but died prior to the death of her mother, the adopted child would take the personalty bequeathed his mother by adoption,
                            even though the adoption was subsequent to the execution of the will, since under the provisions of this section the adopted child has the same standing as though he had been born to his adopted parent at the time of the adoption.

                            of the testator did not take as though he had been a natural born child of the son. Thomas v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 590</cite>, 129 S.E.2d 239 (1963).

                    A decree of adoption does not divest any vested property interest owned by the adoptee immediately prior to the decree of adoption including any public assistance benefit or child support payment due on or before the date of the decree. An adoption divests
                    any property interest, entitlement, or other interest contingent on an ongoing family relationship with the adoptee's former family.

                        The adoption of children is purely a statutory procedure. In re Daughtridge, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 212 S.E.2d 519 (1975).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        North Carolina recognizes the doctrine of equitable adoption. - Lankford v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 115</cite>, 489 S.E.2d 604 (1997).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Equitable Adoption. - Equitable adoption, does not confer the incidents of formal statutory adoption; rather, it merely confers rights of inheritance upon the foster child in the event of intestacy of the foster parents. Lankford v. Wright,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">347 N.C. 115</cite>, 489 S.E.2d 604 (1997).

                    <p>
                        Original Jurisdiction. - Adoption proceedings are within the original jurisdiction of the clerk of superior court. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 327 S.E.2d 315 (1985).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jurisdiction over Custody Matters. - In an adoption proceeding, the fact that the child had been placed by its mother with the department of social services and that the mother had signed a general consent for his adoption did not vest subject matter
                        jurisdiction over all matters pertaining to the child's custody exclusively in the clerk of the superior court or in the superior court itself. Francis v. Durham County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite>                        444, 255 S.E.2d 263 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Adoption Petition Failed to Invoke Court's Subject Matter Jurisdiction. - Adoption decree was invalid because the non-parent was seeking relief that was unavailable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>                        of the General Statutes, as she sought an adoption decree that would establish the legal relationship of parent and child with the minor child but not sever that same relationship between the minor child and his biological mother
                        under G.S. 48-1-106(c) and G.S. 48-3-606(9), and therefore the adoption petition did not invoke the trial court's subject matter jurisdiction under G.S. 48-2-100; as a result, the adoption decree was void ab initio. Boseman v.
                        Jarrell, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 537</cite>, 704 S.E.2d 494 (2010).

                    <p>
                        Transfer of Action to Superior Court. - The clerk of the superior court did not err in transferring plaintiffs' adoption action to the superior court, where a number of factual issues arose in determining whether defendant department of social services

                        Applicable Procedural Rules and Statutes. - Although an adoption proceeding is a special proceeding, no separate procedure is prescribed by statute, so the Rules of Civil Procedure, G.S. 1A-1, and the statutes governing special proceedings, G.S. 1-393
                        et seq., would apply. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 327 S.E.2d 315 (1985).

                        Filing of Motion Alleging Abuse of Discretion in Adoption Process. - In view of this section, which provides that adoption proceedings shall be before the clerk of superior court, any motion alleging an abuse of discretion in the adoption process should
                        be filed with the clerk of superior court within the 10-day period provided for in G.S. 7A-659(f) [see now G.S. 7B-908(f)]. In re N.C.L., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 79, 365 S.E.2d 213, cert.

                        The trial court erred in placing child with petitioners for the purpose of adoption, since adoptions are permitted only upon the statutory procedure set out in this Chapter, by a special proceeding before the clerk of the superior court; moreover, there
                        was no evidence to support the trial court's finding that the department of social services, which had custody of the child, "wrongfully and unreasonably withheld its consent for adoption." In re Sloop,

                    <p>
                        Simultaneous Adoption and Custody Actions. - Because the legislature has enunciated a public policy that every child should have a permanent plan of care, because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent
                        plan of care, and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court's jurisdiction supersedes that of the district court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and
                        custody proceeding. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the absence an order of consolidation, when the same child is the subject of a simultaneous custody and adoption proceeding, both the superior and district courts do not have continuing jurisdiction to fully adjudicate the respective issues before
                        them. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).

                    <p>
                        The filing of an adoption petition in the superior court divests the district court of jurisdiction to adjudicate issues of custody with regard to the child who is the subject of the adoption petition. Griffin v. Griffin,
                        <cite

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption by the superior court, the jurisdiction of the district court with regard to the custody of the child who is the subject of the interlocutory order is in abeyance until such time as the interlocutory
                        decree is vacated, the adoption petition is dismissed or a final decree of adoption is entered. Griffin v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 400, 456 S.E.2d 329 (1995).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because adoption is more likely than a custody proceeding between non-parents to result in a permanent plan of care for the child and because the superior court has jurisdiction over adoptions, that court's jurisdiction supersedes that of the district
                        court with regard to the custody of a child who is the subject of a simultaneous adoption and custody proceeding; therefore, upon the entry of an interlocutory order of adoption by the superior court, the jurisdiction of the district
                        court with regard to the custody of the child who is the subject of the interlocutory order is in abeyance until such time as the adoption petition is dismissed or a final decree of adoption is entered. Griffin v. Griffin,

                        When legal and physical custody of minor child vested in the Department of Social Services (DSS), it was then authorized to proceed in its discretion with placing child for adoption, and the trial court had no authority to interfere with the DSS's placement

                        Jurisdiction. - In a case in which the mother of a child and the child's paternal relatives appealed a district court's dismissal of their motion to overturn the district court's adoption order, the district court properly found that it lacked jurisdiction
                        because the mother and the relatives filed a motion for appropriate relief based on G.S. 15A-1415(b)(3) and G.S. 15A-1443, which were sections of the Criminal Procedure Act. Though it appeared that the mother could have moved the
                        trial court to void the adoption decree pursuant to G.S. 48-2-607(b) based on her claim of duress, she failed to do so. In re W.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 789, 685 S.E.2d 151 (2009).

                        Child Committed to Children's Home Society. - In a case arising under this Chapter before the 1949 revision, the evidence disclosed that the child in question was brought by its mother into the juvenile court of the county of their residence charged with
                        being a dependent child, that the court committed it to the custody of a children's home society having its home office in another county of the State, but that the child was immediately taken by the person seeking to adopt it
                        to that person's residence in another state. It was held that the child never resided in the county in which was located the home office of the children's home society, its mere commitment to the children's home not having had
                        the effect of making the child's constructive residence there, and that adoption proceedings in that county were thus void, since the child was never within its jurisdiction. In re Holder, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 136</cite>,

                <p>
                    A final adoption decree issued by any other state must be recognized in this State. Where a minor child has been previously adopted in a foreign country by a petitioner or petitioners seeking to readopt the child under the laws of North Carolina, the
                    adoption order entered in the foreign country may be accepted in lieu of the consent of the biological parent or parents or the guardian of the child to the readoption. A man and a woman who adopted a minor child in a foreign country
                    while married to one another must readopt jointly, regardless of whether they have since divorced. If either does not join in the petition, he or she must be joined as a necessary party as provided in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 19. If a man and
                    a woman have adopted a minor child in a foreign country while married to one another and one of them has died, then the survivor may petition for readoption, and the court shall issue any decree of adoption in the names of both of
                    the man and the woman who adopted the minor child in a foreign country.

                        Wife's failure to "join" in her husband's petition for the adoption of her two minor children by a previous marriage in no way affected her relationship with the children and was immaterial to a determination of her husband's distributive share under

                        Adoption by Grandparents. - Court did not err in deeming it likely that the grandparents would adopt the child, and it did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the child's best interests would be served by terminating the mother's parental rights
                        because the grandparents did not lack the ability to obtain standing to adopt the child as they were the child's grandparents and legal custodians; they had raised the child since he was 18 months old; they wished to adopt him;
                        by all accounts, the child was thriving in the grandparents' home; and the child's guardian ad litem recommended the termination of the mother's and the father's parental rights in order to facilitate the child's adoption by the
                        grandparents. In re D.E.M., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 401, 802 S.E.2d 766 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 463</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 567, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 55 (2018).

                        Earlier decision setting aside termination order did not "void" basis of subsequent adoption proceeding or earlier termination proceeding, but simply held that termination order must be set aside since the service on putative father was void. In re Clark,

                        Father's Rights. - Nothing the mother did or failed to do placed the biological father in a position in which "qualification for notice" of the existence of the child was "beyond [his] control" during the relevant statutory time frame; thus, the father
                        had the opportunity to be on notice of the pregnancy and he failed to grasp that opportunity by taking any of the steps that would establish him as a responsible father. Because of his passivity in the face of ample evidence that
                        the mother may have become pregnant with his child and given birth, the father did not fall into the class of protected fathers who may claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with a child, and thus he was not deprived
                        of due process. In re S.D.W., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 745 S.E.2d 38, dismissed and review granted, 748 S.E.2d 315, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 243</cite>, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 986 (2013),

                        Consideration of Child's Best Interests Required. - G.S. 48-1-101 is a list of definitions applicable to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite> of the General Statutes which
                        governs adoptions. Although the definitions section does not mention the best interest of the child, G.S. 48-2-501(a), 48-2-603(a), and 48-2-606(a)(7) require that the court consider a child's best interest when considering adoptive
                        placement for the child. In re Papathanassiou, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 671 S.E.2d 572 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 374</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 667 (2009).

                        Department of Social Services Has Duty to Make Investigations. - Under former G.S. 48-16(a), the legislature clearly vested the Department of Social Services with the duty and responsibility to make investigations regarding adoptions; thus, absent any
                        responsibilities or duties to perform, the guardian ad litem is superfluous to an adoption proceeding. In re James S., <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 357 S.E.2d 430 (1987).

                        Clerk of Superior Court Required to Transfer Adoption Proceedings to District Court. - Because an adoption action was still pending with the clerk of the superior court, and a maternal grandmother contested the adoptions of her grandchildren by paternal
                        grandparents, the clerk was required to transfer the adoption proceedings to the district court for adjudication under G.S. 48-2-601(a1); the case was remanded to the clerk of superior court to determine whether the adoption action
                        was still contested, and if so, to transfer the adoption proceedings to district court for a hearing under G.S. 48-2-603 to determine whether adoption by paternal grandparents was in the best interests of the children. Norris v.
                        Norris, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 692 S.E.2d 190 (2010).

                        Request for Equitable Relief. - Father's request to set aside a clerk's order finding that his consent was not necessary for the adoption of his child was a request for equitable relief and was properly transferred to the district court pursuant to G.S.
                        1-301.2(b), giving the district court jurisdiction to address the father's motions; therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the motions were not properly before it under G.S. 1-301.2(e) because the clerk's decision
                        was not final. In re Fisher, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 290, 745 S.E.2d 883 (2013).

                        Consideration of Child's Best Interests Required. - G.S. 48-1-101 is a list of definitions applicable to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite> of the General Statutes which
                        governs adoptions. Although the definitions section does not mention the best interest of the child, G.S. 48-2-501(a), 48-2-603(a), and 48-2-606(a)(7) require that the court consider a child's best interest when considering adoptive
                        placement for the child. In re Papathanassiou, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 671 S.E.2d 572 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 374</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 667 (2009).

                        Because an adoption action was still pending with the clerk of the superior court, and a maternal grandmother contested the adoptions of her grandchildren by paternal grandparents, the clerk was required to transfer the adoption proceedings to the district
                        court for adjudication under G.S. 48-2-601(a1); the case was remanded to the clerk of superior court to determine whether the adoption action was still contested, and if so, to transfer the adoption proceedings to district court
                        for a hearing under G.S. 48-2-603 to determine whether adoption by paternal grandparents was in the best interests of the children. Norris v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 692 S.E.2d

                        Consideration of Child's Best Interests Required. - G.S. 48-1-101 is a list of definitions applicable to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite> of the General Statutes which
                        governs adoptions. Although the definitions section does not mention the best interest of the child, G.S. 48-2-501(a), 48-2-603(a), and 48-2-606(a)(7) require that the court consider a child's best interest when considering adoptive
                        placement for the child. In re Papathanassiou, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 278, 671 S.E.2d 572 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 374</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 667 (2009).

                        Only Parent or Guardian Who Was Not Party May Attack Adoption Proceeding. - The provision in former G.S. 48-26 which permitted a direct or collateral attack on an adoption proceeding by a natural parent or guardian of the person of the child was limited
                        to such natural parent or guardian of the person of the child who was not a party to the adoption proceeding. Hicks v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 34</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 214 (1961).

                        Collateral Attack on Adoption by Party Is Prohibited. - The provisions of former G.S. 48-26 would prevent a collateral attack by husband on adoption of wife's child, where he was a party to the proceeding. Andrews v. Andrews,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 338 S.E.2d 809, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 730</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 385 (1986).

                        Biological Mother in Direct Placement Adoption Could Not Attack Its Validity. - Domestic partner was a legal parent of a child because the parties' adoption was a direct placement adoption with a waiver of the full terms of parental consent and legal
                        obligations specified in G.S. 48-1-106(c) and G.S. 48-3-606, and under G.S. 48-2-607(a), a biological mother, as a party to the adoption, could not question its validity based on any defect or irregularity, jurisdictional or otherwise.

                    <p>
                        Attack on Adoption by Child. - Former G.S. 48-26 clearly prohibits any direct or collateral attack in adoption proceedings except by a biological parent or guardian of the child. It makes no provision for attack by the child, and nothing in the section
                        requires that the child have been represented by counsel or that a guardian ad litem have been appointed. Flinn v. Laughinghouse, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 315 S.E.2d 72, appeal dismissed
                        and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 755</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 132 (1984).

                        Where it was apparent that child was begotten during the period of separation between her natural mother and her mother's husband which figured in the couple's divorce action as the basis of the court's judgment, the child had no standing in an action
                        over 20 years later to attack her adoption on the grounds that her natural father was not made a party to the adoption proceedings, and that she herself was not represented by counsel or a guardian ad litem and did not give her
                        consent to the adoption. Flinn v. Laughinghouse, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 315 S.E.2d 72, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 755</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 132

                    <p>
                        Attack on Adoption Based on Duress. - In a case in which the mother of a child and the child's paternal relatives appealed a district court's dismissal of their motion to overturn the district court's adoption order, the district court properly found
                        that it lacked jurisdiction because the mother and the relatives filed a motion for appropriate relief based on G.S. 15A-1415(b)(3) and G.S. 15A-1443, which were sections of the Criminal Procedure Act. Though it appeared that the
                        mother could have moved the trial court to void the adoption decree pursuant to G.S. 48-2-607(b) based on her claim of duress, she failed to do so. In re W.R.A., <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite>                        789, 685 S.E.2d 151 (2009).

                        District Court Lacked Jurisdiction to Review Superior Court Clerk's Orders Setting Aside Adoption Decrees. - District court erred in declaring that a superior court clerk's orders setting aside adoption decrees allowing paternal grandparents to legally
                        adopt their grandchildren were void and that the adoption decrees remained valid because the district court did not obtain jurisdiction to review the clerk's orders pursuant to an appeal under G.S. 48-2-607(b) when the grandparents
                        did not appeal the clerk's orders setting aside the adoption decrees; since the grandparents did not appeal the clerk's orders, they remained in effect under G.S. 1-301.2(e), and the orders were interlocutory and not appealable
                        pursuant to G.S. 1-301.2(e). Norris v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 566, 692 S.E.2d 190 (2010).

                    <p>
                        Final Order Not Required for Transfer. - Father's request to set aside a clerk's order finding that his consent was not necessary for the adoption of his child was a request for equitable relief and was properly transferred to the district court pursuant
                        to G.S. 1-301.2(b), giving the district court jurisdiction to address the father's motions; therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the motions were not properly before it under G.S. 1-301.2(e) and G.S. 48-2-607(b).

                    Refusal to consent to a criminal history check by any individual required to be checked under G.S. 48-3-309(a) is grounds for the issuance by a county department of social services of an unfavorable preplacement assessment. Any person who intentionally

                        Retention of Custody by Agency Until Occurrence of Specified Event. - Under former G.S. 48-9.1, the county department of social services or child placing agency to which a child had been surrendered by his parents retained legal custody of the child until
                        the occurrence of one of the events specified therein, and legal custody never passed to any foster parent charged with the duty of caring for and supervising the child. Oxendine v. Catawba County Dep't of Social Servs.,

                        Action for Custody of Foster Child Governed by Section. - Action to obtain custody of a child placed in plaintiffs' home pursuant to a foster parent agreement was governed by former G.S. 48-9.1 and not by G.S. 7A-289.33 [see now G.S. 7B-1112]. Section
                        7A-289.33 [see now G.S. 7B-1112] sets forth the effects of a court order terminating the parental rights of a natural parent on grounds of abuse or neglect, and such a court order was not involved where the natural parents had
                        voluntarily released their parental rights and surrendered their child for adoptive placement. Oxendine v. Catawba County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370

                        Standing of Foster Parents to Challenge Agency's Denial of Request to Adopt Child. - Since the welfare of the child is the controlling factor in an adoption proceeding, any agreement between foster parents and a department of social services concerning
                        the adoption of a child who is placed in a home for foster care is subject to the court's independent judgment as to what is in the best interest of the child; consequently, in a child custody suit, defendant department of social
                        services could not seek to deprive plaintiffs, as foster parents, of standing to challenge the reasonableness of defendant's denial of plaintiffs' request to adopt the minor child placed in their home. Oxendine v. Catawba County
                        Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981).

                        Foster Parents Have No Standing to Bring Custody Action. - Nothing in the language of former G.S. 48-9.1(1) gave foster parents standing to contest the department's or agency's exercise of its rights as legal custodian; therefore, foster parents are without
                        standing to bring an action seeking custody of minor child placed in their home by defendant. Oxendine v. Department of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981); In

                        But Transfer of Custody to Foster Parents Is Not Prohibited. - The case of Oxendine v. Department of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370, (1981) does not prohibit the transfer of legal care,
                        custody and control of a foster child to its foster parents. Oxendine stands for the proposition that foster parents have no standing to bring a custody action pursuant to G.S. 50-13.2 et seq. In re Scearce, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C.

                        Jurisdiction, Generally. - Where neither the father nor the mother of the child was a party to the proceeding within the contemplation of the statute, and the clerk had no jurisdiction of their person, consequently he had no jurisdiction of the subject
                        matter. Truelove v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 430</cite>, 132 S.E. 295 (1926), discussed in 5 N.C. L. Rev. 67 (1927).

                        Consent is essential to an order of adoption. In re Daughtridge, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 212 S.E.2d 519 (1975).

                        And parent's consent to adoption must be shown within the record and must relate to the particular persons seeking to adopt the child. In re Holder, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 136</cite>, 10 S.E.2d 620 (1940).

                        Except as Provided in Former G.S. 48-5 and G.S. 48-6. - Under former G.S. 48-7, except as provided in former G.S. 48-5 and G.S. 48-6, before a child can be adopted the written consent of the parents or surviving parent or guardian of the person of the
                        child must be obtained. In re Hoose, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 589</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 555 (1956).

                        Absent consent of the adoptive parents, the court was without jurisdiction to order the adoption of a child unless her adoptive parents had abandoned such child within the meaning of our statutes. In re Hoose, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 589</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Time Periods for Determining Statutory Compliance. - Trial court did not err by analyzing different time periods for determining whether a putative father complied with the acknowledgment requirement of G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b)(4) and whether the putative
                        father met the financial support and the visitation or communication requirements of G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b)(4)(II) because the statute contemplated that different time periods may be considered when determining if the putative father's
                        actions established the necessity of his consent to the adoption. In re Adoption of S.K.N., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 735 S.E.2d 382 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Consent of a minor child's father was necessary, under G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b)(4), before the grandparents could adopt the child because the father acknowledged paternity and could make reasonable and consistent support payments. Miller v. Lillich,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 606 S.E.2d 181 (2004), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 634</cite>, 613 S.E.2d 692 (2005).

                    <p>
                        Before any petition for adoption of a child could be granted, a father's consent was required because the father provided the reasonable and consistent support required under G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b)(4)(II) by obtaining employment and purchasing items such
                        as a car seat that could only be used in support of the father's child. In re Adoption of K.A.R., <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 696 S.E.2d 757 (2010), review denied 706 S.E.2d 236, 2011

                        Procedure for Adopting Child Without Putative Father's Consent of Biological Mother's Husband. - Pursuant to G.S. 48-3-603, prior to legitimating a child, a putative father's consent would not have been required for the child to have been placed for adoption,
                        and pursuant to G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b), prior to the putative father's legitimating the child, the consent of the biological mother's husband would have been required for the child to have been placed for adoption. However, pursuant
                        to G.S. 48-3-603(a)(2), the husband's consent was not required after the putative father's petition to legitimate the child was granted. In re Papathanassiou, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 278,
                        671 S.E.2d 572 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 374</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 667 (2009).

                    <p>
                        No Discrimination Based on Gender Under Former Law. - Former 48-6 provided a means of identifying persons who are similarly situated with respect to the child and gave them similar rights, rather than making simply a gender-based distinction; hence, it
                        did not discriminate against similarly situated individuals on the basis of gender. In re Baby Girl Dockery, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 495 S.E.2d 417 (1998).

                    <p>
                        Agency's Consent Is Simply an Additional Safeguard. - The consent of those in custody of the child under statutory provisions, unlike the absolute required consent of competent natural parents, is simply an additional safeguard to the welfare and best
                        interests of the child. In re Daughtridge, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 212 S.E.2d 519 (1975).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Consent of the county department of social services to the adoption was required by virtue of former G.S. 48-9(b). In re Daughtridge, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 212 S.E.2d 519 (1975).
                        <br />

                        Rights of Social Services Following Termination of Rights. - Upon entry of an order terminating parental rights, the County Department of Social Services acquired the same rights that it would have acquired if the parent had consented to the adoption
                        of that child under former G.S. 48-9(a)(1). Krauss v. Wayne County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 371</cite>, 493 S.E.2d 428 (1997).

                        When Court May Order Adoption to Proceed Without Agency's Consent. - Should a court find that an agency has unreasonably withheld its consent, the court has the right to order that the adoption proceed without the written consent of the agency, resulting,
                        as a practical matter, in the adoption of the child proceeding with the consent of the court substituted for the consent of the agency. In re Daughtridge, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 212

                        Consent Not Wrongfully Withheld. - The trial court erred in placing child with petitioners for the purpose of adoption, since adoptions are permitted only upon the statutory procedure set out in this Chapter, by a special proceeding before the clerk of
                        superior court; moreover, there was no evidence to support the trial court's finding that the department of social services, which had custody of the child, "wrongfully and unreasonably withheld its consent for adoption." In re

                        The language of subsection (d) of former G.S. 48-7, that adoption by a stepparent does not affect the parent-child relationship with the natural parent, was a measure to protect that parent-child relationship from the otherwise sweeping effects of former
                        G.S. 48-23(1), which otherwise might be construed to terminate the natural parent-child relationship. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 302, 335 S.E.2d 39 (1985), aff'd,

                        The court insisted that the respondent had failed to provide the requisite support, pursuant to this section, for the biological mother and for his child although he asserted that he was prevented from complying by the mother's refusing his offer to stay
                        with his mother during her pregnancy, the filing of the adoption petition just one day after the birth of the child, and the uncertainty as to whether he was, in fact, the father. Byrd ex rel. Byrd,

                        Consent Not Wrongfully Withheld. - While putative father satisfied the statutory requirement for acknowledgement of paternity, as he readily and unconditionally acknowledged paternity of the unborn child for a substantial and sufficient amount of time
                        after initially learning of the pregnancy, where he did not provide reasonable and consistent payments for the support of the mother or child or both during the period before the filing of the adoption petition, despite evidence
                        of his ability to make some payment in support, his consent to child's adoption was not required, because all requirements of the statute must be met in order for putative father's consent to be necessary. In re Adoption of Byrd,

                        Opportunity to Join Putative Father. - Even if putative father's consent to adoption was necessary, petitioners' failure to join him at the time they filed their original adoption petition did not authorize the trial court to dismiss the adoption proceeding
                        without first giving petitioners the opportunity to join putative father within a reasonable time. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989), rev'd on other grounds,

                        Third-Party Acknowledgement of Paternity. - Trial court did not err in concluding that a putative father satisfied G.S. 48-3-601, thereby necessitating his consent for the adoption of his son, because the father's declarations to his mother and stepmother
                        and his mother's phone call to Department of Social Services were sufficient to establish the father's acknowledgment of paternity under G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b)(4). In re Adoption of S.K.N., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite>                        41, 735 S.E.2d 382 (2012).

                        Acknowledgment May Not Be Conditioned on Establishing Biological Link. - This section does not allow a potential father's acknowledgment of his paternity to be conditioned on establishing a biological link with the child. Consequently, the respondent
                        who conditioned his acknowledgment of his paternity of the child failed to preserve his consent rights for adoption although he offered to provide the biological mother a place to live during her pregnancy and attempted a variety
                        of jobs to provide for the child. Byrd ex rel. Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 623, 529 S.E.2d 465 (2000), aff'd sub nom. In re Adoption of Byrd, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 188</cite>,

                        Putative father's request for a blood test to confirm his paternity of a child did not void his acknowledgement of paternity for purposes of consenting to an adoption because G.S. 48-3-201(2)(b)(4), providing a means to establish whether the putative
                        father had to consent to an adoption, contemplated the putative father might not know whether he was the biological father. In re Adoption of S.K.N., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 735 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Knowledge of Pregnancy. - Trial court did not err in concluding a putative father satisfied the support and communication requirements of G.S.48-3-601(2)(b)(4)(II), despite the father's lack of knowledge the mother was pregnant, because, the father repeatedly
                        inquired if the mother was pregnant, the mother denied she was pregnant and went to great lengths to conceal the pregnancy, and, despite the mother's repeated denials, the father continued to provide support to and reside with
                        the mother both during her pregnancy and after she secretly gave birth to the child; the statute did not require the putative father have knowledge of the pregnancy for purposes of providing support and communication. In re Adoption
                        of S.K.N., <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 41, 735 S.E.2d 382 (2012).

                    <p>
                        Nothing the mother did or failed to do placed the biological father in a position in which "qualification for notice" of the existence of the child was "beyond [his] control" during the relevant statutory time frame; thus, the father had the opportunity
                        to be on notice of the pregnancy and he failed to grasp that opportunity by taking any of the steps that would establish him as a responsible father. Because of his passivity in the face of ample evidence that the mother may have
                        become pregnant with his child and given birth, the father did not fall into the class of protected fathers who may claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with a child, and thus he was not deprived of due process.

                        order of reference directing the superintendent of public welfare (now director of social services) of the county to make a full investigation to determine if the child was a proper child for adoption, and the natural parents intervened
                        and moved to vacate and dismiss the proceeding, it was held that at the time of the reference and at the time the court came to determine whether the child was the proper subject for adoption the status of the child had changed
                        from illegitimate to legitimate, and the motion of the interveners to vacate the proceeding and for the custody of their child should have been allowed, it being required in a proceeding for the adoption of a legitimate child that
                        its natural parents be parties or their consent to the adoption be made to appear unless they have abandoned the child. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 1</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 8 (1949).

                        Standing of Foster Parents to Challenge Agency's Denial of Request to Adopt Child. - Since the welfare of the child is the controlling factor in an adoption proceeding, any agreement between foster parents and a department of social services concerning
                        the adoption of a child who is placed in a home for foster care is subject to the court's independent judgment as to what is in the best interest of the child; consequently, in a child custody suit, defendant department of social
                        services could not seek to deprive plaintiffs, as foster parents, of standing to challenge the reasonableness of defendant's denial of plaintiffs' request to adopt the minor child placed in their home. Oxendine v. Catawba County

                        Foster Parents Have No Standing to Bring Custody Action. - Nothing in the language of former G.S. 48-9.1(1) gave foster parents standing to contest the department's or agency's exercise of its rights as legal custodian; therefore, foster parents were
                        without standing to bring an action seeking custody of minor child placed in their home by defendant. Oxendine v. Department of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 699</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 370 (1981);

                        Evidence held sufficient to support findings that social worker made a misrepresentation of an existing fact, with knowledge that it was false and with the intent to deceive 17-year-old parents into signing adoption consent forms, and that a prudent person
                        could have reasonably relied on her statements concerning the adoption process and the contents of the forms and signed the forms without reading them.

                        Biological father's consent was not necessary to allow an adoption to proceed where he failed to unequivocally acknowledge his paternity prior to the filing of the adoption petition and failed to express a desire to be the child's father. In re Adoption

                        Consent Not Required of Father Who Did Not Provide Support. - Putative father's consent to the adoption of his minor child was not required, pursuant to G.S. 48-3-601(2)(b)(4)(II), as the father's mere offers of support were insufficient under the statute
                        to require the consent of the father to the adoption. Despite possessing adequate wherewithal, the father, a teenager who had obtained employment, never provided any actual financial payments to the mother, much less the reasonable
                        and consistent payments required under the subsection. In re Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 271</cite>, 624 S.E.2d 626 (2006).

                    <p>
                        In an adoption case, the consent of a biological father was not required because the father did not provide reasonable and consistent payments of support under this section commensurate with his ability to provide such payments; actual, real, and tangible

                        Although a putative father testified that he saved money as the father could over time by placing money in a lockbox in the father's room, the father's evidence failed to demonstrate through an objectively verifiable record that the father made the statutorily
                        required reasonable and consistent payments for the support of a minor child before the adoption petition was filed. Thus, the father's consent was not required before proceeding with the adoption of the child. In re C.H.M.,

                        Passive Father's Consent Not Required. - Biological father's consent for an adoption to proceed pursuant to G.S. 48-3-601 was not required; because of his passivity in the face of ample evidence that the mother may have become pregnant with his child
                        and given birth, the father did not fall into the class of protected fathers who may claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with a child, and thus the father was not deprived of due process. In re Adoption of S.D.W.,

                    If a parent as described in G.S. 48-3-601 has been adjudicated incompetent, then the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for that parent and, unless the child already has a guardian, a guardian ad litem for the child to make a full investigation as
                    to whether the adoption should proceed. The investigation shall include an evaluation of the parent's current condition and any reasonable likelihood that the parent will be restored to competency, the relationship between the child
                    and the incompetent parent, alternatives to adoption, and any other relevant fact or circumstance. If the court determines after a hearing on the matter that it will be in the best interest of the child for the adoption to proceed,
                    the court shall order the guardian ad litem of the parent to execute for that parent a consent as provided in this Part or a relinquishment as provided in Part 7 of this Article.

                        Abandonment implies conduct on the part of the parent which manifests a willful determination to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to the child. In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite>                        273, 346 S.E.2d 511 (1986).

                        Abandonment Judicially Determined. - Under the former law, the existence of abandonment as ground for an adoption without parental consent must be judicially determined. Truelove v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 430</cite>,
                        132 S.E. 295 (1926).

                    <p>
                        Abandonment Must Be Willful. - Where there was evidence in behalf of defendant father tending to show that plaintiff took possession of his children against his will and prevented him from performing his parental duty, as well as evidence to the contrary,
                        it was held that when the jury found for defendant the case did not fall within the meaning of the former section. Howell v. Solmon, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 588</cite>, 83 S.E. 609 (1914).

                    <p>
                        Willfulness is as much an element of abandonment within the meaning of this section as it is of the crime of abandonment described in G.S. 14-322 and former G.S. 14-326. In re Hoose, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 589</cite>, 91
                        S.E.2d 555 (1956); In re Maynor, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 248 S.E.2d 875 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Abandonment requires a willful intent to escape parental responsibility and conduct in effectuation of such intent. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962); Boring v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        550, 169 S.E.2d 79 (1969).

                    <p>
                        "Willful" Defined. - The word "willful" means something more than an intention to do a thing. It implies doing the act purposely and deliberately. Clark v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">67 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 313 S.E.2d 284, cert.
                        denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 756</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 128 (1984); In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 346 S.E.2d 511 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Willful intent is a question of fact to be determined from the evidence. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962); In re Searle, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 273, 346 S.E.2d

                        Purpose to Forego Parental Duties. - To constitute abandonment by a parent of his child, so as to deprive him of the right to prevent the adoption of the child, there must be some conduct on the part of the parent which evinces a purpose to forego his
                        parental duties. Truelove v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 430</cite>, 132 S.E. 295 (1926).

                    <p>
                        Mere Failure to Contribute to Support of Child Does Not Constitute Abandonment. - A mere failure of the parent of a minor child in the custody of a third person to contribute to its support does not in and of itself constitute abandonment, since explanations
                        could be made which would be inconsistent with a willful intent to abandon. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962); In re Maynor, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C.

                        Continued Willful Failure to Support Would Evidence Abandonment. - A continued willful failure to perform the parental duty to support and maintain a child would be evidence that a parent had relinquished his claim to the child. Pratt v. Bishop,

                        It Is Not Necessary That Parent Absent Himself from Child Continuously. - To constitute an abandonment within the meaning of this section it is not necessary that a parent absent himself continuously from the child for the specified six months, nor even
                        that he cease to feel any concern for its interest. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962); Boring v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 169

                        If His Conduct Shows Intent to Forego All Obligations and Relinquish All Claims. - If the parent's conduct over the 6-month period evinces a settled purpose and a willful intent to forego all parental duties and obligations and to relinquish all parental
                        claims to the child there has been abandonment within the meaning of this section. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962); Boring v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        550, 169 S.E.2d 79 (1969).

                    <p>
                        A child has been "willfully abandoned" when the conduct of the abandoning parent over the 6-month period reveals a settled purpose and willful intent to forego all parental duties and obligations and to relinquish all parental claims to the child. Rigby

                        Legal abandonment is not a transitory concept that may be recessed at the whim of the transgressor. In re Cardo, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 255 S.E.2d 440 (1979).

                        Parent May Not Dissipate Its Effects by Expressing Desire for Child's Return. - Abandonment is not an ambulatory thing, the legal effects of which a delinquent parent may dissipate at will by the expression of a desire for the return of the discarded
                        child. Boring v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 550, 169 S.E.2d 79 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Conduct Amounting to Abandonment. - If a parent withholds his presence, his love, his care and the opportunity to display filial affection, and willfully neglects to lend support and maintenance, such parent relinquishes all parental claims and abandons
                        the child. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962); In re Cardo, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 255 S.E.2d 440 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Provide for Medical Attention as Evidence of Abandonment. - Showing that child was in need of medical attention and father failed to provide funds or otherwise show concern about his condition tended to be some evidence of willful abandonment.
                        In re Cardo, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 255 S.E.2d 440 (1979).

                    <p>
                        Abandonment Not Shown. - For case in which abandonment of an illegitimate child was not shown, see In re Jones, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 312</cite>, 69 S.E. 217 (1910).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Money Sent After Filing of Petition Irrelevant. - Where records indicated that father sent money for child's care after filing of petition for a declaration of abandonment, these funds were irrelevant to the issue of whether the child had been abandoned
                        as alleged in the petition, and therefore this evidence would not be admissible. In re Cardo, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 255 S.E.2d 440 (1979).

                        Commission of Crime Resulting in Incarceration. - The fact that a parent commits a crime which might result in incarceration is insufficient, standing alone, to show a settled purpose to forego all parental duties. In re Maynor,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 248 S.E.2d 875 (1978).

                    <p>
                        The fact that respondent committed the felony of crime against nature, was found guilty and was incarcerated did not evince a willful intent on his part to forego any responsibility to his child. In re Maynor, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite>                        724, 248 S.E.2d 875 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Where respondent's evidence tended to show that he was not aware that child had been placed in the custody of the Department of Social Services, that he was unable to locate his son, and that as a result of his incarceration, he was unable to make any
                        payments to support the child, the fact that respondent was unable to locate his son and was unable to make support payments as a result of his incarceration was inconsistent with a willful intent to abandon his son. In re Maynor,
                        <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 248 S.E.2d 875 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Instructions. - An instruction to the jury explaining that "willful means that the abandonment would be without just cause or excuse, unjustifiable and wrong; that the respondent had a purpose to do it without authority, careless of whether he had a right
                        or not," was sufficient. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An instruction as to abandonment alone, without an instruction as to the time period over which abandonment must exist, was an insufficient explanation of the law arising from the facts. McIntosh v. McIntosh, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                        742, 202 S.E.2d 804 (1974).

                        Consent of Parent Guilty of Abandonment Need Not Be Obtained. - If it is determined that a child or children have been abandoned, the consent of the parent or guardian guilty of the abandonment of such child or children need not be obtained. Hicks v.

                        If Child Has Been Abandoned for Six Months Parent Is Not Necessary Party. - If it is found that a child has been abandoned for at least six months immediately preceding the institution of an action or proceeding to declare the child an abandoned child,
                        then such parents, surviving parent, or guardian of the person declared guilty of the abandonment shall not be necessary parties to any proceeding brought under this Chapter. Hicks v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 34</cite>,

                    <p>
                        The time of abandonment is not determinative of jurisdiction, but is determinative of the question of whether or not the parents, surviving parent, or guardian of the person must be a party to the adoption proceeding. Hicks v. Russell,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">256 N.C. 34</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 214 (1961).

                        Where a court of competent jurisdiction has declared a child to be an abandoned child, the court is not ousted of its jurisdiction, even though it may be found that abandonment occurred less than six months prior to the institution of the proceeding to
                        determine whether the child had been abandoned. Hicks v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 34</cite>, 123 S.E.2d 214 (1961).

                        The act of adoptive parents of child in entering into contract consenting to its adoption by another couple does not constitute constructive abandonment of the child so as to obviate the necessity of their consent to its adoption by such other couple.
                        Therefore, when such consent is withdrawn within six months, the proceedings for adoption by such other couple should be dismissed upon motion. In re Hoose, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 589</cite>, 91
                        S.E.2d 555 (1956).

                        Effect of Judgment Retained for Further Orders. - Former G.S. 48-10, to which former G.S. 48-5 corresponded, provided that parents or guardians who had been declared by a juvenile court to be unfit to have the custody of the child were not necessary parties
                        to adoption proceedings. It was held that this provision was intended to apply only to a final, absolute and unconditional determination of unfitness, and not to a judgment of unfitness retained "for further orders as the continued
                        welfare of said child and changing conditions may require." In re Morris, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 487</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 539 (1944).

                        Procedure for Adopting Child Without Parent's Consent. - Prior to October 1, 1985, two procedures were available to enable a petitioning party to adopt a minor child without the consent of the opposing biological parent. First, under G.S. 7A-289.32 [see
                        now G.S. 7B-1111], a court could terminate the parental rights of a biological parent upon a finding of one of the grounds enumerated therein, and then, pursuant to this section, once a district court had entered an order terminating
                        the parental rights of a biological parent, that parent was no longer a necessary party to an adoption proceeding. Second, the court, under subsection (d) of this section, upon proper motion, was authorized to hold a hearing to
                        determine whether an abandonment as defined in former G.S. 48-2(1)a and (1)b had taken place. However, effective October 1, 1985, these proceedings were merged into one termination of parental rights proceeding under G.S. 7A-289.32(8)

                        Prior Termination of Parental Rights Not Necessary. - While termination of a putative father's rights may precede an adoption petition, prior termination of his rights under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite>                        is not necessary if, under the applicable provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>, his consent to the adoption is not necessary; his parental rights are then terminated
                        by the final order of adoption under G.S. 48-23. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Opportunity to Join Putative Parent Should Have Been Granted. - Even if putative father's consent to adoption was necessary, petitioners' failure to join him at the time they filed their original adoption petition did not authorize the trial court to
                        dismiss the adoption proceeding without first giving petitioners the opportunity to join putative father within a reasonable time. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835

                        G.S. 7A-289.32 [see now G.S. 7B-1111] Compared. - The grounds which render a putative father's consent unnecessary under subdivision (a)(3) of former G.S. 48-6 are identical to the grounds for terminating his parental rights under G.S. 7A-289.32(6) [see
                        now G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5)]. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

                        Standing to Attack Adoption. - Where it was apparent that child was begotten during the period of separation between her natural mother and her mother's husband, which figured in the couple's divorce action as the basis of the court's judgment, the child
                        had no standing in an action over 20 years later to attack her adoption on the grounds that her natural father was not made a party to the adoption proceedings, and that she herself was not represented by counsel or a guardian
                        ad litem and did not give her consent to the adoption. Flinn v. Laughinghouse, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 476, 315 S.E.2d 72, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 755</cite>,

                        For case holding father's consent to adoption of illegitimate child by mother and her husband unnecessary under this section as it formerly read, see Jolly v. Queen, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 711</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 592 (1965).

                    <p>
                        Father's Knowledge of Existence of Child Irrelevant. - A putative father's knowledge of the existence of his illegitimate child is not relevant to a proper analysis of the necessity of a putative father's consent under subdivision (a)(3) of former G.S.
                        48-6. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Subdivision (a)(3) of former G.S. 48-6 reflected the same legislative choices evident in the termination of a putative father's rights under G.S. 7A-289.32(6) [see now G.S. 7B-1111(a)(5)]: under neither statute is the illegitimate child's future welfare
                        dependent on whether or not the putative father knows of the child's existence at the time the petition is filed. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 381 S.E.2d 835 (1989), rev'd on
                        other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Father Not Entitled to Notice of Intent to File Petition to Adopt. - Although putative father is entitled to notice under subdivision (a)(3) of former G.S. 48-6 of any hearing held to determine the necessity of his consent, the statutes do not provide
                        for any notice to the putative father of a petitioner's intent to file a petition to adopt his illegitimate child or otherwise terminate his parental rights. In re Clark, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite>                        1, 381 S.E.2d 385 (1989), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Subsequently Filed Affidavit Did Not Relate Back to Original Filing Date. - Where termination order, later held to be invalid for failure to use due diligence in ascertaining putative father's address, was filed with an adoption petition in lieu of affidavit
                        required by former G.S. 48-13, a subsequently filed affidavit did not relate back to original filing date of petition so as to cut off rights of a putative father who filed legitimation petition to G.S. 49-10 before affidavit was
                        filed. In re Adoption of Clark, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 61</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 791 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Legitimation Proceeding Held Without Effect upon Mother's Prior Consent to Adoption. - A legitimation proceeding brought by the putative father of a child born out of wedlock, wherein the child was declared legitimate, had no effect upon the prior written
                        consent to adoption given by the unwed mother under this section as it formerly read. In re Doe, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 181 S.E.2d 760, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 394</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Review of Finding that Consent Not Required. - Father's request to set aside a clerk's order finding that his consent was not necessary for the adoption of his child was a request for equitable relief and was properly transferred to the district court
                        pursuant to G.S. 1-301.2(b), giving the district court jurisdiction to address the father's motions; therefore, the district court erred in concluding that the motions were not properly before it under G.S. 1-301.2(e) because the
                        clerk's decision was not final. In re Fisher, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 290, 745 S.E.2d 883 (2013).

        Effect of Finding on Subsequent Proceeding.
       </b> - If during an adoption proceeding a clerk of court makes a finding that the child sought to be adopted has been abandoned by his parents, and if the proceeding is dismissed without any order of adoption being entered,
                        the finding of abandonment made during the adoption proceeding will suffice as a finding of abandonment within the meaning of this section for the purpose of a subsequent adoption proceeding. See opinion of Attorney General to
                        Mr. Louis O'Conner, Jr., Director, Welfare Programs Division, State Department of Social Services, 40 N.C.A.G. 646 (1969).

                        Revocation of Consent. - Court of Appeals of North Carolina holds that G.S. 48-3-605 requires (1) that an original or copy of a signed consent to adoption be provided to the biological parent who has signed the document and (2) that the time period allowed
                        by G.S. 48-3-608 for revocation does not begin to run until the requirements of G.S. 48-3-605 have been met. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 810 S.E.2d 740 (2018).

                    <p>
                        Keeping in mind the plain language of G.S. 48-1-100, 48-3-605, and 48-3-608, the Court of Appeals of North Carolina rejects a reading of the relevant statutes that would lead to a result contrary to the legislature's intent. Rather, the Court of Appeals
                        holds that the time for revocation under G.S. 48-3-608(a) does not begin to run until an original or copy of the signed consent is actually delivered to the consenting parent consistent with the provisions and purposes of G.S.
                        48-3-605. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 810 S.E.2d 740 (2018).

                        Trial court did not err in concluding that a mother's revocation was timely where the mother received a copy of her signed consent on a particular date, and she had submitted a notice of revocation within seven days of that date. In re Ivey,

                        of the legislature that a biological parent consenting to adoption receive, as a matter of fact, an original or copy of the signed consent in order for it to be effectuated.

                        Failure to Satisfy Statutory Requirements. - Terminating a father's parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was
                        filed, as the father sought the children's custody during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children's custody to others, terminating the father's child support obligation, denying the father visitation,
                        and purporting to waive any objection to termination, erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process,
                        and the order's terms did not meet statutory requirements for a consent to adoption or relinquishment of parental rights to an agency. In re C.K.C., <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 158, 822 S.E.2d

                        Purpose. - The purpose of former G.S. 48-11 was obvious: to give stability to the adoptive process. It allows prospective adoptive parents, as well as the child, to settle into a stable home environment, to be disturbed only upon those occasions when,
                        prior to the final order, county directors of social services or adoptive agencies conduct studies of the provisions being made for the child. It also gives the natural parents a period of intense review of their decision to allow
                        the adoption. In re Kasim, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 293 S.E.2d 247, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 742</cite>, 295 S.E.2d 478 (1982).

                        Instrument held sufficient revocation of consent to adoption. In re Hoose, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 589</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 555 (1956).

                        Letter mailed by natural mother to one of the petitioners, stating that she was withdrawing her consent to child's adoption, constituted sufficient notice of revocation under the law as it stood prior to Oct. 1, 1983, the effective date of subsection
                        (b) of former G.S. 48-11, and was timely made inasmuch as less than three months (now 30 days) had elapsed since execution of the consent to adopt and no interlocutory or final order of adoption had been entered. In re Terry,
                        <cite

                        Evidence held sufficient to support findings that social worker made a misrepresentation of an existing fact with knowledge that it was false and with the intent to deceive 17-year-old parents into signing adoption consent forms, and that a prudent person
                        could have reasonably relied on her statements concerning the adoption process and the contents of the forms and signed the forms without reading them.

                        Consent Not Procured by Fraud. - Adoptive father's attempt to void his consent to the adoption of his wife's daughter based on fraud failed, because the adoptive father failed to prove that the wife made any misrepresentations with regard to any alleged
                        plans on her part to separate or divorce; based on the wife telling the adoptive father of her unhappiness and the couple's frequent arguments with regard to the adoptive father's drug use, the adoptive father knew or should have

                        demonstrates the intent of the legislature that a biological parent consenting to adoption receive, as a matter of fact, an original or copy of the signed consent in order for it to be effectuated. In re Ivey,

                        Court of Appeals of North Carolina holds that G.S. 48-3-605 requires (1) that an original or copy of a signed consent to adoption be provided to the biological parent who has signed the document and (2) that the time period allowed by G.S. 48-3-608 for
                        revocation does not begin to run until the requirements of G.S. 48-3-605 have been met. In re Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 810 S.E.2d 740 (2018).

                        holds that the time for revocation under G.S. 48-3-608(a) does not begin to run until an original or copy of the signed consent is actually delivered to the consenting parent consistent with the provisions and purposes of G.S.

                        Consent Not Procured by Fraud. - Adoptive father's attempt to void his consent to the adoption of his wife's daughter based on fraud failed, because the adoptive father failed to prove that the wife made any misrepresentations with regard to any alleged

                        Failure to Satisfy Statutory Requirements. - Terminating a father's parental rights on grounds of abandonment and neglect by abandonment erred because (1) the father did not willfully abandon the children during the six months before the petition was
                        filed, as the father sought the children's custody during that time, and (2) findings based on a consent order granting the children's custody to others, terminating the father's child support obligation, denying the father visitation,
                        and purporting to waive any objection to termination, erred, as the order was void as against public policy, since the statutory termination process had to be followed, any agreement to relinquish parental rights avoided this process,

                <p>
                    In addition to the mandatory provisions listed in G.S. 48-3-703, a relinquishment may also state that the relinquishment may be revoked upon notice by the agency that an adoption by a specific prospective adoptive parent, named or described in the relinquishment
                    is not completed. In this event the parent's time to revoke a relinquishment is 10 days, inclusive of weekends and holidays, from the date the parent receives such notice from the agency. The revocation shall be in writing and delivered
                    in a manner specified in G.S. 48-3-706(a) for revocation of relinquishments. An agency, which after the exercise of due diligence cannot personally locate the parent entitled to this notice, may deposit a copy of the notice in the
                    United States mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the address of the parent given in the relinquishment, and the date of receipt by the parent is deemed to be the date of delivery or last attempted delivery. If a parent does
                    not revoke the relinquishment in the time and manner provided in this section, the relinquishment is deemed a general relinquishment to the agency, and the agency may place the child for adoption with a prospective adoptive parent
                    selected by the agency.

                        A relinquishment of any infant who is in utero or any minor may be revoked within seven days following the day on which it is executed by the infant or minor's parent or guardian, inclusive of weekends and holidays. If the final day of the period falls
                        on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday when North Carolina courthouses are closed for transactions, then the revocation period extends to the next business day. The individual who gave the relinquishment may revoke by giving
                        written notice to the agency to which the relinquishment was given. Notice may be given by personal delivery, overnight delivery service, or registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. If notice is given by mail, notice
                        is deemed complete when it is deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the agency at the agency's address as given in the relinquishment. If notice is given by overnight delivery service, notice is deemed
                        complete on the date it is deposited with the service as shown by the receipt from the service, with delivery charges paid by the sender, addressed to the agency at the agency's address as given in the relinquishment.

                        to legal custody to the person who relinquished the minor and divests the agency of any right to legal or physical custody and any further responsibility for the care and support of the minor. In any subsequent proceeding, the

                        Biological Parent Need Not Join in Spouse's Petition for Adoption of Her Children. - G.S. 29-17(e) and subsection (d) of former G.S. 48-7 were enacted, not to retain adopted children's status as "lineal descendants" by the former marriage, but instead
                        to provide that the parent-child relationship between adopted children and their biological parent is not severed by the parent's spouse's adoption of her children from a former marriage. Since the relationship remains intact in
                        this limited situation, it is not necessary for such a biological parent to become a co-petitioner in her husband's adoption of her legitimate children of a former marriage. This biological parent, however, must consent to the
                        adoption, as must any biological parent who does not come within the ambit of G.S. 48-6. In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>,

                        Wife's failure to "join" in her husband's petition for the adoption of her two minor children by a previous marriage in no way affected her relationship with the children and was immaterial to a determination of her husband's distributive share under
                        former G.S. 30-3(b). In re Estate of Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 698</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 913, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 704</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 40 (1986).

                        suggests that the circumstances surrounding a particular adoption and the identities of the parties involved are ordinarily not matters of public interest. Hall v.

                        Failure to Grant Protective Order. - An appellate court could not hold that a district court in a child custody proceeding erred in failing to grant the defendant county department of social services a "protective order based upon confidentiality of records
                        as set out in [former] G.S. 48-25," where the record on appeal did not reveal exactly what type of "protective order" was requested by the defendant and did not even clearly reveal that the district court, after being presented
                        with a proper motion by the defendant for any such order, refused to grant it. Francis v. Durham County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 444, 255 S.E.2d 263 (1979).

                        subpoenaed the files of the plaintiff's former counsel, who were employed to aid plaintiff and her deceased husband in adopting their first child, and the files most likely contained duplicates of many of the papers protected by

                        Cancellation of Child Support Arrearages Against Public Policy. - Where the trial court concluded that mother was equitably estopped from collecting the child support arrearages and the sole basis for the estoppel was that the mother had promised she
                        would "not pursue the action for child support arrears" in exchange for the father's consent to adoption, the agreement violated this section in that both the mother and the father gave and received consideration for the placement
                        of the child for adoption. Thus the agreement was void as being contrary to the public policy and could not be used in equity to estop the mother from enforcing her judgment for the full amount of the child support arrearages.

                        Father's agreement to consent to the adoption of his child violated G.S. 48-37 and was void as contrary to public policy, in that it was in exchange for the termination of his child support obligations and the mother's agreement not to pursue child support,
                        either prospective or in arrears; therefore, the consent agreement cannot be used to estop DSS from reopening the child support case and seeking reimbursement for the public assistance paid subsequent to the consent order. Stanly

                        Editor's Note. - The cases below were decided prior to the 1995 revision of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.048.html" target="_blank">Chapter 48</a></cite>.

                        Violation of Section. - Actions of adopting parents and their attorney in making funds available for the purpose of bringing a biological mother into the State so as to facilitate the adoption of her unborn child, including supporting her and the child
                        through the date of birth and returning the mother to her home state, constituted a violation of former G.S. 48-25. In re P.E.P., <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 692</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 505 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Cancellation of Child Support Arrearages Against Public Policy. - Where the trial court concluded that mother was equitably estopped from collecting the child support arrearages and the sole basis for the estoppel was that the mother had promised she
                        would "not pursue the action for child support arrears" in exchange for the father's consent to adoption, the agreement violated this section in that both the mother and the father gave and received consideration for the placement
                        of the child for adoption. Thus the agreement was void as being contrary to the public policy and could not be used in equity to estop the mother from enforcing her judgment for the full amount of the child support arrearages.

        Arrangement by Prospective Adoptive Parents to Pay Transportation Expenses and Medical Costs for Expectant Mother.
       </b> - Under former G.S. 48-37 as it read prior to the 1991 amendment, prospective adoptive parents who entered into an arrangement with an expectant mother to pay her transportation expenses to North Carolina as well as
                        all medical costs incident to the birth of the child pursuant to an independent adoption placement violated the provisions of this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Renee P. Hill, 45 N.C.A.G. 24 (1975).
