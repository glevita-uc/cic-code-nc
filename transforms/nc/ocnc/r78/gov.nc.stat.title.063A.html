            This Chapter is the "North Carolina Global TransPark Authority Act." It is enacted in part pursuant to Article V, Section 13, of the North Carolina Constitution with the intent that the body politic and corporate created by this Chapter shall have all
            power and authority as may be provided to it under that section of the Constitution.

     Editor's Note.
    </b> - Session Laws 1991, c. 749, s. 2, provides: "Interpretation of act.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(a) This act shall not be deemed to exclude additional or alternative methods for executing the provisions of this act, shall be regarded as supplemental to power conferred by other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(b) This act, being necessary for the health and welfare of the people of this State, shall be liberally construed to effect its purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(c) Insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the provisions of any general laws, the provisions of this act shall be controlling.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(d) Insofar as the provisions of this act are inconsistent with the provisions of any local, special, or private laws, the provisions of those laws are repealed to the extent of the conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(e) If any provisions of this act or its application are held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this act that can be given effect without the invalid provisions or application, and to this end the provisions
            of this act are severable.
        </p>
        <p>
            "(f) References in this act to specific acts, sections, or Chapters of the General Statutes are intended to be references to such acts, sections, or chapters as they may be amended from time to time by the General Assembly."
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Laws 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), c. 777, s. 4(a), effective July 17, 1994, renamed this Chapter, which had been entitled the North Carolina Air Cargo Airport Authority. In making this change the act misquoted the former name of the chapter. The act
            was in the coded bill drafting format provided by G.S. 120-20.1. The chapter name has been set out as above at the direction of the Revisor of Statutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Session Laws 1993 (Reg. Sess., 1994), c. 777, which amended this section, in s. (4)(
            <i>
     l
    </i> ) provides: "Any reference to the North Carolina Air Cargo Airport Authority in any other act of the General Assembly is deemed to refer to the North Carolina Global TransPark Authority."
