       The sole involvement of the county board of social services in personnel matters is to select the county director
   
   of social services. And the director derives his authority to appoint personnel directly from the General Assembly, not from the board. Thus the local board does not become the "local appointing authority" pursuant to G.S. 126-37 (now repealed) in the absence of a permanent full-time director.

       In an action by eligibility supervisor of county department of social services alleging that her constitutional rights had been violated when her employment was terminated by the director of social services, the county could not be held liable to the plaintiff since the director was not acting for the county, but rather for the State, and since the county board of social services did not have the authority to dismiss the eligibility supervisor.

     <p>
      The county board of social services is authorized to enter into contracts with any governmental or private agency, or with any person, whereby the board of social services agrees to render services to or for such agency or person in exchange for a fee to cover the cost of rendering such service. This authority is to be limited to services voluntarily rendered and voluntarily received, but shall not apply where the charging of a fee for a particular service is specifically prohibited by statute or regulation. The fees to be charged under the authority of this section are to be based upon a plan recommended by the county director of social services and approved by the local board of social services and the board of county commissioners. In no event is the fee charged to exceed the cost to the board of social services. Fee policies may not conflict with rules and regulations adopted by the Social Services Commission or Department of Health and Human Services regarding fees.

       Authority Exercised by County over Director.
   
   - It is apparent that the county is at most only equal to the State in the authority it can exert over the director of social services. Fracaro v. Priddy, 514 F.

       Department of Human Resources Liable for Acts of County Director Negligently Placing Foster Child.
   
   - In an action alleging that a foster child was negligently placed in a home by the Durham County Department of Social Services, the Department of Human Resources would be liable for the negligent acts of its agents, the Durham County Director of Social Services and his subordinates, since the Department of Human Resources, through the Social Services Commission has the right to control the manner in which the county director is to execute his obligation to place children in foster homes. Vaughn v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 683</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 792 (1979), decided under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.108.html" target="_blank">Chapter 108</a></cite>.

       Liability of Social Workers Negligently Placing Foster Child.
   
   - The language of subsection (b) of this section and the holding of Meyer v. Walls, 347 N.C. at 111, 489 S.E.2d at 888, lead to the conclusion that defendants who were acting for and representing a director of social services were acting as public officials and could therefore not be held individually liable in a case alleging negligent placement of a foster child.

       Discretion and Immunity of Social Workers
   
   - Pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa01s108A-14" target="_self">G.S. 108A-14</a></cite>, a social worker for a county department of human services has the statutory authority to exercise discretion in that capacity, that is, in the capacity of a social worker; thus, where a social worker took various actions in the social worker's capacity as a social worker for a county human services agency that clearly required the exercise of discretion and were not simply ministerial, the social worker was considered a public official for purposes of public official immunity. Dalenko v. Wake County Dep't of Human Servs., <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 49, 578 S.E.2d 599 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 458</cite>, 585 S.E.2d 386 (2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1178, 124 S. Ct. 1411, 158 L. Ed. 2d 79 (2004).
      </p>
      <p>
       As a county social worker exercised discretion in the performance of her duties of investigating claims of child neglect and abuse, she qualified as a public official pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa01s108A-14ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 108A-14(b)</a></cite>, such that she was entitled to public official immunity in a wrongful death action arising from an investigation that she was involved in involving a child who later died from shaken baby syndrome.

       Investigation of Child Abuse and Neglect.

       Juvenile Petition for Termination of Parental Rights.
   
   - Trial court had subject matter jurisdiction over the juvenile petition filed by the caseworker even though the caseworker did not sign it and, thus, the trial court could enter its termination of parental rights order regarding the father; while the caseworker did not specifically state in the petition that the caseworker was an authorized representative of the director of the Department of Social Services, the caseworker's verification of the petition was sufficient for the trial court to exercise jurisdiction over the case. In re D.D.F., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 654 S.E.2d 1 (2007).
      </p>
      <p>
       Representative of a local department of social services, which was acting as a state agent, was acquainted with the facts of a termination of parental rights case. Therefore, the representative's verification of the petitions alleging neglect and dependency was effective to grant jurisdiction to the trial court. In re N.X.A., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C.

      "Whereas, the recent federal Child and Family Services Review (CFSR) and the North Carolina Statewide Child Protective Services Evaluation of the State's Child Protective Services (CPS) program identified troubling gaps and flaws in North Carolina's child welfare system that are allowing too many of those vulnerable children and fragile families to fall through the cracks; and

       Injured Party Was a Recipient Despite Being a Minor.
   
   - Where the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Medical Assistance, expended Medicaid funds to pay certain medical care providers for services that they had rendered to an injured party, the injured party qualified as a "recipient" of medical assistance benefits within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-24" target="_self">G.S. 108A-24(5)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-59" target="_self">G.S. 108A-59</a></cite> even though the injured party was a minor at the time that the benefits were paid; there was no requirement that a "recipient" had to be one who had received a direct cash payment or relief from debt, or one who had the legal right to sue for medical benefits.

       - Where North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance (DMA) sought to recoup Medicaid overpayments made to a debtor hospital, in order to qualify for recoupment, the DMA's recoupment claim was required to have arisen from the "same transaction" as the overpayment; the bankruptcy court found that the ongoing stream of services, advances, and reconciliations that was unique to the Medicaid system constituted a single transaction for recoupment purposes, and although the relationship between the hospital and the DMA involved several transactions for the provision of services to several patients, this relationship was not analogous to multiple, separate equipment purchases from a single supplier, which would not have been part of the same transaction.

   - There was no substantive due process right violated in the trial court's decision to affirm the decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, (DHHS) to decertify a corporation as a provider of HIV case management services because the trial court perceived that the corporation's lack of proper progress notes prevented DHHS from being able to accurately account for funds allotted by the Division of Medical Services for the program of public assistance, and given that the problem was evident in all four case managers at the corporation, decertification would ensure that funds provided for public assistance would be protected; the trial court's decision was rationally related to the <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-25ol1b" target="_self">G.S. 108A-25(b)</a></cite> goal of providing a program of public assistance, as supported by the trial court's findings of fact, conclusions of law and substantial record evidence.

       State-County Special Assistance.
      </b>
      - Session Laws 2009-451, s. 10.57(a)-(e), provides: "The eligibility of Special Assistance recipients residing in adult care homes on August 1, 1995, shall not be affected by an income reduction in the Special Assistance eligibility criteria resulting from adoption of the Rate Setting Methodology Report and Related Services, providing these recipients are otherwise eligible. The maximum monthly rate for these residents in adult care home facilities shall be one thousand two hundred thirty-one dollars ($1,231) per month per resident.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Effective October 1, 2009, the maximum monthly rate for residents in adult care home facilities shall be one thousand one hundred eighty-two dollars ($1,182) per month per resident unless adjusted by the Department in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. The eligibility of Special Assistance recipients residing in adult care homes on September 30, 2009, shall not be affected by an income reduction in the Special Assistance eligibility criteria resulting from the adoption of this maximum monthly rate, provided these recipients are otherwise eligible.

      "The maximum monthly rate for residents in Alzheimer/Dementia special care units shall be one thousand five hundred fifteen dollars ($1,515) per month per resident unless adjusted by the Department in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Department of Health and Human Services shall review activities and costs related to the provision of care in adult care homes and shall determine what costs may be considered to properly maximize allowable reimbursement available through Medicaid personal care services for adult care homes (ACH-PCS) under federal law. As determined, and with any necessary approval from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and the approval of the Office of State Budget and Management, the Department may transfer necessary funds from the State-County Special Assistance program within the Division of Social Services to the Division of Medical Assistance and may use those funds as State match to draw down federal matching funds to pay for such activities and costs under Medicaid's personal care services for adult care homes (ACH-PCS), thus maximizing available federal funds. The established rate for State-County Special Assistance set forth in subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall be adjusted by the Department to reflect any transfer of funds from the Division of Social Services to the Division of Medical Assistance and related transfer costs and responsibilities from State-County Special Assistance to the Medicaid personal care services for adult care homes (ACH-PCS). Subject to approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and prior to implementing this section, the Department may disregard a limited amount of income for individuals whose countable income exceeds the adjusted State-County Special Assistance rate. The amount of the disregard shall not exceed the difference between the Special Assistance rate prior to the adjustment and the Special Assistance rate after the adjustment and shall be used to pay a portion of the cost of the ACH-PCS and reduce the Medicaid payment for the individual's personal care services provided in an adult care home. In no event shall the reimbursement for services through the ACH-PCS exceed the average cost of the services as determined by the Department from review of cost reports as required and submitted by adult care homes. The Department shall report any transfers of funds and modifications of rates to the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Senate Appropriations Committee on Health and Human Services, and the Fiscal Research Division.
     </p>
     <p>
      "The Department of Health and Human Services shall recommend rates for State-County Special Assistance and for Adult Care Home Personal Care Services. The Department may recommend rates based on appropriate cost methodology and cost reports submitted by adult care homes that receive State-County Special Assistance funds and shall ensure that cost reporting is done for State-County Special Assistance and Adult Care Home Personal Care Services to the same standards as apply to other residential service providers."

      Tiered Rate Structure Pilot Program.
   
   - Session Laws 2013-360, s. 12D.2(a)-(e), provides: "(a) As used in this section, the term 'group home' means any facility that (i) is licensed under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122C</a></cite> of the General Statutes, (ii) meets the definition of a supervised living facility under 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(1) or 10A NCAC 27G.5601(c)(3), and (iii) serves adults whose primary diagnosis is mental illness or a developmental disability but may also have other diagnoses.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly to create a State-County Special Assistance program that allows counties greater flexibility in serving individual needs within their communities and greater control over how county funds are used to support this program in light of the fact that counties are required to pay for fifty percent (50%) of the costs of this program. To that end, the General Assembly directs the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a pilot program in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(c) The Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Aging and Adult Services (Department), shall establish a pilot program to implement a tiered rate structure within the State-County Special Assistance program for individuals residing in group homes, in-home living arrangements, and assisted living residences as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html#t131Da01s131D-2.1" target="_blank">G.S. 131D-2.1</a></cite>. The purposes of the pilot program are to (i) determine the best way to implement a block grant for this program statewide and (ii) test the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing a tiered rate structure to address program participants' intensity of need, including medication management. The Department shall select a minimum of four and a maximum of six counties to participate in the pilot program, at least two of which shall be rural counties and at least two of which shall be urban counties. The pilot program shall (i) be implemented during the 2013-2014 fiscal year, (ii) operate for at least a 12-month period, and (iii) comply with any agreements in effect between the State of North Carolina and the United States government.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(d) The Department shall implement the pilot program in collaboration with the local departments of social services in the counties selected for participation. As part of the pilot program, the selected counties shall receive a State General Fund allocation as a block grant to be equally matched with county general funds. The General Fund allocation provided to each county participating in the pilot program shall be calculated based upon the average annual Special Assistance expenditures for that county during the 2011-2013 fiscal biennium, adjusted for the amount of projected annual growth in the number of Special Assistance recipients in that county during the 2013-2015 fiscal biennium. These funds may be used to pay for room, board, and personal care services, including medication management, for individuals eligible to receive State-County Special Assistance, subject to the following limitations and requirements:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) These funds shall not be used to cover any portion of the cost of providing services for which an individual receives Medicaid coverage.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The pilot program shall comply with all federal and State requirements governing the existing State-County Special Assistance program, except that Section 12D.3 does not apply to the pilot program.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The tiered rate structure shall be based upon intensity of need, and an individual's placement within a tier shall be based upon an independent assessment of the individual's need for room, board, and assistance with activities of daily living, including medication management.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(e) By February 1, 2014, the Department shall submit a progress report on the implementation and operation of the pilot program, including any obstacles to implementation; and by February 1, 2015, the Department shall submit a final report on the results of the pilot program, along with any recommendations based on these results, to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and the Fiscal Research Division. The report due by February 1, 2015, shall include information from all participating counties on at least all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) The amount of the tiered rates implemented as part of the pilot program.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) The cost methodology for determining these tiered rates.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) The number of individuals participating in the pilot program while residing in a group home.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) The number of individuals participating in the pilot program while residing in an in-home living arrangement.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) The number of individuals participating in the pilot program while residing in an assisted living residence as defined by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131D.html#t131Da01s131D-2.1" target="_blank">G.S. 131D-2.1</a></cite>, broken down by facility type.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) A comparison of the number of recipients of State-County Special Assistance prior to and during the pilot program, broken down by county and living arrangement.
     </p>
     <p>

To the extent any provision in this subsection or subsection 10.15A(h1) of this act conflicts with another provision in Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite>, this subsection and subsection 10.15A(h1) controls.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) Simple Procedures. - Notwithstanding any other provision of Article 3 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 150B</a></cite> of the General Statutes, the chief administrative law judge may limit and simplify the procedures that apply to a contested Medicaid case involving a Medicaid applicant or recipient in order to complete the case as quickly as possible. To the extent possible, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall schedule and hear all contested Medicaid cases within 55 days of submission of a request for appeal. Hearings shall be conducted telephonically or by video technology, however the recipient or applicant, or the recipient's or applicant's representative may request that the hearing be conducted before the administrative law judge in person. An in-person hearing shall be conducted in Wake County, however for good cause shown, the in-person hearing may be conducted in the county of residence of the recipient or applicant. Good cause shall include but is not limited to the applicant's or recipient's impairments limiting travel or the unavailability of the applicant's or recipient's treating professional witnesses. The Department shall provide written notice to the recipient or applicant of the use of telephonic hearings, hearings by video conference, and in-person hearings before the administrative law judge, and how to request a hearing in the recipient's or applicant's county of residence. The simplified procedure may include requiring that all prehearing motions be considered and ruled on by the administrative law judge in the course of the hearing of the case on the merits. An administrative law judge assigned to a contested Medicaid case shall make reasonable efforts in a case involving a Medicaid applicant or recipient who is not represented by an attorney to assure a fair hearing and to maintain a complete record of the hearing. The administrative law judge may allow brief extensions of the time limits contained in this section for good cause and to ensure that the record is complete. Good cause includes delays resulting from untimely receipt of documentation needed to render a decision and other unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances. Continuances shall only be granted in accordance with rules adopted by the Office of Administrative Hearings, and shall not be granted on the day of the hearing, except for good cause shown. If a petitioner fails to make an appearance at a hearing that has been properly noticed via certified mail by the Office of Administrative Hearings, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall immediately dismiss the contested case provision.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Mediation. - Upon receipt of an appeal request form as provided by subdivision 10.15A(h1)(4) of this act or other clear request for a hearing by a Medicaid applicant or recipient, the Office of Administrative Hearings shall immediately notify the Mediation Network of North Carolina which shall within five days contact the petitioner to offer mediation in an attempt to resolve the dispute. If mediation is accepted, the mediation must be completed within 25 days of submission of the request for appeal. Upon completion of the mediation, the mediator shall inform the Office of Administrative Hearings and the Department within 24 hours of the resolution by facsimile or electronic messaging. If the parties have resolved matters in the mediation, the case shall be dismissed by the Office of Administrative Hearings. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall not conduct any contested Medicaid cases hearings until it has received notice from the mediator assigned that either: (i) the mediation was unsuccessful, or (ii) the petitioner has rejected the offer of mediation, or (iii) the petitioner has failed to appear at a scheduled mediation. Nothing in this subdivision shall restrict the right to a contested case hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Burden of Proof. - The petitioner has the burden of proof to show entitlement to a requested benefit or the propriety of requested agency action when the agency has denied the benefit or refused to take the particular action. The agency has the burden of proof when the appeal is from an agency determination to impose a penalty or reduce, terminate, or suspend a benefit previously granted. The party with the burden of proof on any issue has the burden of going forward, and the administrative law judge shall not make any ruling on the preponderance of evidence until the close of all evidence.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4a) New Evidence. - The petitioner shall be permitted to submit evidence regardless of whether obtained prior to or subsequent to the Department's actions and regardless of whether the Department had an opportunity to consider the evidence in making its determination to deny, reduce, terminate or suspend a benefit. When such evidence is received, at the request of the Department, the administrative law judge shall continue the hearing for a minimum of 15 days and a maximum of 30 days to allow for the Department's review of the evidence. Subsequent to review of the evidence, if the Department reverses its original decision, it shall immediately inform the administrative law judge.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4b) Issue for Hearing. - For each penalty imposed or benefit reduced, terminated, or suspended, the hearing shall determine whether the Department substantially prejudiced the rights of the petitioner and if the Department, based upon evidence at the hearing:
     </p>
     <p>
      "a. Exceeded its authority or jurisdiction;
     </p>
     <p>
      "b. Acted erroneously;
     </p>
     <p>
      "c. Failed to use proper procedure;
     </p>
     <p>
      "d. Acted arbitrarily or capriciously; or
     </p>
     <p>
      "e. Failed to act as required by law or rule.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Decision. - The administrative law judge assigned to a contested Medicaid case shall hear and decide the case without unnecessary delay. The Office of Administrative Hearings shall send a copy of the audiotape or diskette of the hearing to the agency within five days of completion of the hearing. The judge shall prepare a written decision and send it to the parties. The decision must be sent together with the record to the agency within 20 days of the conclusion of the hearing.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(h3) From funds available to the Department of Health and Human Services for the 2008-2009 fiscal year, the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000) shall be transferred by the Department of Health and Human Services to the Office of Administrative Hearings. These funds shall be allocated by the Office of Administrative Hearings for mediation services provided for Medicaid applicant and recipient appeals and to contract for other services necessary to conduct the appeals process.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(h4) Effective October 1, 2008, the Department of Health and Human Services shall discontinue its current informal appeals process for Medicaid applicants and recipients appealing a determination made by the Department to deny, terminate, suspend, or reduce Medicaid covered services. All such informal appeals by Medicaid applicants or recipients under the current system which are pending on that date and for which a hearing has not been held shall be discontinued and the applicant or recipient offered an opportunity to appeal to the Office of Administrative Hearings in accordance with the provisions of subsection 10.15A(h1) of this act. The Department shall make every effort to resolve or settle all of the backlogged cases prior to the effective date of this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(h5) Nothing in this act shall prevent the Department of Health and Human Services from engaging in an informal review of the case with the applicant or recipient prior to issuing a notice of adverse determination as provided by subsection 10.15A(h1) of this act.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(h6) The appeals process for Medicaid applicants and recipients established under this section shall expire July 1, 2010. The Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Administrative Hearings shall each report to the House of Representatives Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Health and Human Services, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, and the Fiscal Research Division on March 1, 2009, October 1, 2009, and March 1, 2010, on the costs, effectiveness, and efficiency of the appeals process for Medicaid applicants and recipients and make recommendations regarding the continuation of the process."

      <p>
       North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services is the agency responsible for operating the state's Medicaid plan.
   
   A local political subdivision of the State under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122C.html#t122Ca04s122C-116ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 122C-116(a)</a></cite>, is one which has contracted with the NCDHHS to operate a managed care Medicaid program on the state's behalf. K.C. v. Shipman, 716 F.3d 107 (4th Cir. 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
       ALJ and trial court had jurisdiction to hear a Medicaid provider's contest to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS) decision that the provider received an overpayment, despite the provider's failure to appeal that decision within 60 days of receiving a private contractor's tentative notice of overpayment (TNO), because the TNO did not begin the time for appealing an administrative decision as DHHS could not delegate the discretionary authority to decide how to dispose of the issue to the private contractor as (1) DHHS was the state's single state agency authorized to make such decisions, and (2) the TNO stated a "final decision" would be reached in the future, so the TNO did not inform the provider of DHHS's final decision on the matter, which initiated the appeal time.

       Subdivision of County May Not Be Subrogated to Its Rights.
   
   - A county department of social services may not recover by subrogation under this section, since that right inheres only in the county involved, not such county department. Malloy v. Durham County Dep't of Social Servs., <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 293 S.E.2d 285 (1982), decided under former G.S. 108-61.2

      <p>
       Evidence of a Collateral Benefit.
   
   - In tort actions, evidence of a collateral benefit is improper when the plaintiff will not receive a double recovery. Because Medicaid provides for a right of subrogation in the State to recover sums paid to plaintiffs, this principle is applicable thereto. Cates v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 1</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 734 (1987).

       Subrogation Rights.
   
   - The plain language of this section does not provide that the State is subrogated to all rights of recovery to the extent of all money a medical assistance beneficiary receives, only that the State is subrogated to all rights of recovery of the beneficiary of medical assistance to the extent of payments under the entitled Medical Assistance Program. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 466 S.E.2d 717, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 896</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 905 (1996).

       When a minor recipient of Medicaid benefits settled medical negligence claims with health care providers, equitable subrogation principles did not apply to the right of the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Medical Assistance, to a share of the settlement, because <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57(a)</a></cite> specifically provided that the State "shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery," "notwithstanding any other provisions of the law."

Andrews v. Haygood, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 655 S.E.2d 440 (2008), aff'd, review improvidently allowed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 599</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 310 (2008).

       Minor Qualified As "Beneficiary".
   
   - Where the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Medical Assistance (DMA), expended Medicaid funds to pay medical care providers for services to an injured party, the injured party qualified as a "beneficiary" of medical assistance benefits within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57</a></cite> for purposes of the DMA's right of subrogation to the injured party's settlement from a tortfeasor even though the injured party was a minor at the time that the benefits were paid; under the statute's plain meaning, a "beneficiary" includes one who receives benefits and there is no requirement that a "beneficiary" has to be one who has received a direct cash payment or relief from debt, or one who has the legal right to sue for medical benefits. Campbell v. N.C. Dep't of Human Res., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 569 S.E.2d 670 (2002).

       With respect to a minor who is both a "recipient" and a "beneficiary" of medical assistance, the North Carolina third-party liability statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-59ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-59(a)</a></cite>, by their plain language abrogate the common law rule that a minor cannot recover for medical expenses. A minor's share of the proceeds of a malpractice settlement therefore was not shielded from the state's reimbursement claim by virtue of minority. E.M.A. v. Cansler, 674 F.3d 290 (4th Cir. 2012).

       Action Subject to Abatement.
   
   - Because a family's federal lawsuit seeking a determination that the State department of health and human services was not entitled to a lien on the proceeds of the family's medical malpractice settlement against various defendants involved the same parties, issues, and remedies as the department's action against the family, the trial court erred in denying the family's motion to abate the department's state court action.

Armstrong v. Cansler, 722 F. Supp. 2d 653 (W.D.N.C. June 28, 2010), vacated 674 F.3d 290, 2012 U.S. App. LEXIS 5996 (4th Cir. N.C. 2012).

       Unrebuttable presumption inherent in the one-third cap on the state's recovery imposed by the North Carolina Medicaid third-party liability statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-59" target="_self">G.S. 108A-59</a></cite>, is in fatal conflict with federal law, which limits a state's third-party recovery to settlement proceeds representing payment for medical expenses. In the event of a lump-sum settlement, the sum certain allocable to medical expenses must be determined, in the absence of a stipulation by the affected parties, by judicial determination or some similar adversarial process.

       Injured Party Was a "Recipient" of Medical Assistance Despite Being a Minor When Benefits Were Paid.
   
   - Where the North Carolina Department of Human Resources, Division of Medical Assistance, expended Medicaid funds to pay certain medical care providers for services that they had rendered to an injured party, the injured party qualified as a "recipient" of medical assistance benefits within the meaning of <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-24" target="_self">G.S. 108A-24(5)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-59" target="_self">G.S. 108A-59</a></cite> even though the injured party was a minor at the time that the benefits were paid; there was no requirement that a "recipient" had to be one who had received a direct cash payment or relief from debt, or one who had the legal right to sue for medical benefits. Campbell v. N.C. Dep't of Human Res., <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 569 S.E.2d 670 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       With respect to a minor who is both a "recipient" and a "beneficiary" of medical assistance, the North Carolina third-party liability statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57(a)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-59ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 108A-59(a)</a></cite>, by their plain language abrogate the common law rule that a minor cannot recover for medical expenses. A minor's share of the proceeds of a malpractice settlement therefore was not shielded from the state's reimbursement claim by virtue of minority. E.M.A. v. Cansler, 674 F.3d 290 (4th Cir. 2012).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subrogation Rights in State's Favor Properly Recognized.
   
   - Trial court properly granted reimbursement to a payor who paid a Medicaid recipient's medical expenses, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa02s108A-57" target="_self">G.S. 108A-57</a></cite>, and did not err in subrogating the settlements subject to the one-third limitation outlined within the statute; moreover, the payor's claim was properly characterized as a lien, and although the trial court improperly labelled the payor as a "beneficiary," that was harmless error. Andrews v. Haygood, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 244, 655 S.E.2d 440 (2008), aff'd, review improvidently allowed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 599</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 310 (2008).

       Application. - This section applies only to contested Medicaid cases as defined in this Part. Except as otherwise provided by Article 1A of Chapter 108D of the General Statutes, G.S. 108A-70.9A, and this section governing time lines and procedural steps, a contested Medicaid case commenced by a Medicaid or NC Health Choice recipient is subject to the provisions of Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes. To the extent any provision in this section, Article 1A of Chapter 108D of the General Statutes, or G.S. 108A-70.9A conflicts with another provision in Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes, this section, Article 1A of Chapter 108D of the General Statutes, and G.S. 108A-70.9A control.

       Simple Procedures. - Notwithstanding any other provision of Article 3 of Chapter 150B of the General Statutes, the chief administrative law judge may limit and simplify the procedures that apply to a contested Medicaid case involving a Medicaid or NC Health Choice recipient in order to complete the case as quickly as possible.
       <ol>
        <li id="t108Aa02s108A-70.9Bol1b1">
         To the extent possible, OAH shall schedule and hear contested Medicaid cases within 55 days of submission of a request for appeal.

         Hearings shall be conducted telephonically or by video technology with all parties, however the recipient may request that the hearing be conducted in person before the administrative law judge. An in-person hearing shall be conducted in Wake County, however, for good cause shown, the in-person hearing may be conducted in the county of residence of the recipient or a nearby county. Good cause shall include, but is not limited to, the recipient's impairments limiting travel or the unavailability of the recipient's treating professional witnesses. The Department shall provide written notice to the recipient of the use of telephonic hearings, hearings by video conference, and in-person hearings before the administrative law judge, and how to request a hearing in the recipient's county of residence.
        </li>
        <li id="t108Aa02s108A-70.9Bol1b3">
         The simplified procedure may include requiring that all prehearing motions be considered and ruled on by the administrative law judge in the course of the hearing of the case on the merits. An administrative law judge assigned to a contested Medicaid case shall make reasonable efforts in a case involving a Medicaid or NC Health Choice recipient who is not represented by an attorney to assure a fair hearing and to maintain a complete record of the hearing.

        <li id="t108Aa02s108A-70.9Bol1b4">
         The administrative law judge may allow brief extensions of the time limits contained in this section for good cause and to ensure that the record is complete. Good cause includes delays resulting from untimely receipt of documentation needed to render a decision and other unavoidable and unforeseen circumstances. Continuances shall only be granted in accordance with rules adopted by OAH and shall not be granted on the day of the hearing, except for good cause shown. If a petitioner fails to make an appearance at a hearing that has been properly noticed via certified mail by OAH, OAH shall immediately dismiss the contested case, unless the recipient moves to show good cause within three business days of the date of dismissal.

           The recipient's right to examine at a reasonable time before the hearing and during the hearing the contents of the recipient's case file and documents to be used by the Department in the hearing before the administrative law judge.

           Circumstances in which a medical assessment may be obtained at agency expense and be made part of the record.

If mediation is accepted, the mediation must be completed within 25 days of submission of the request for appeal. Upon completion of the mediation, the mediator shall inform OAH and the Department within 24 hours of the resolution by facsimile or electronic messaging. If the parties have resolved matters in the mediation, OAH shall dismiss the case. OAH shall not conduct a hearing of any contested Medicaid case until it has received notice from the mediator assigned that either: (i) the mediation was unsuccessful, or (ii) the petitioner has rejected the offer of mediation, or (iii) the petitioner has failed to appear at a scheduled mediation.
      </li>
      <li id="t108Aa02s108A-70.9Bol1d">
       Burden of Proof. - The recipient has the burden of proof on all issues submitted in a contested Medicaid case to OAH and has the burden of going forward.  The administrative law judge shall not make any ruling on the preponderance of evidence until the close of all evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t108Aa02s108A-70.9Bol1e">
       New Evidence. - The recipient shall be permitted to submit evidence regardless of whether obtained prior to or subsequent to the Department's actions and regardless of whether the Department had an opportunity to consider the evidence in making its adverse determination. When the evidence is received, at the request of the Department, the administrative law judge shall continue the hearing for a minimum of 15 days and a maximum of 30 days to allow for the Department's review of the evidence. Subsequent to review of the evidence, if the Department reverses its original decision, it shall immediately inform the administrative law judge.

In collaborating in this effort, the agencies shall develop a comprehensive approach to early childhood education, birth through third grade, including creating cross agency accountability with a comprehensive set of data indicators, including consideration of the NC Pathways to Grade-Level Reading, to monitor and measure success of the early childhood education systems.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) The Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Public Instruction, and any other agencies or organizations that administer, support, or study early education programs in this State shall report their findings and recommendations, including any legislative proposals, resulting from the initiative to develop and implement a statewide vision for early childhood education pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. The agencies shall make an initial report to Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and the Joint Legislative Education Oversight Committee on or before January 1, 2017, submit a follow up report to those same committees on or before January 1, 2018, and may make any subsequent reports, annually, on or before January 1, as needed to those same committees.

      "(c) The Department of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Department of Public Instruction, shall promote the successful transition of children who receive assistance from NC Pre-K program and the Child Care Subsidy Assistance program for four- and five-star rated facility classrooms to kindergarten. In its promotion of a successful transition from preschool to kindergarten, the Department of Health and Human Services shall recommend that both NC Pre-K teachers and preschool teachers prepare a preschool to kindergarten transition plan for each child transitioning to kindergarten that documents the child's strengths and needs based on the five Goals and Developmental Indicator domains for children's developmental and learning progress that are based on the NC Foundations for Early Learning and Development. The preparation of the transition plan shall only apply to children who receive assistance through the NC Pre-K program or the Child Care Subsidy Assistance program. It is the intent of the General Assembly that the Departments utilize this transition plan until such time as the standardized program to transition children from preschool to kindergarten, required pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, is developed and implemented.

The Division shall collaborate with county departments of social services to develop a model of oversight that supports program outcomes and a county's ability to meet performance standards as outlined in the Program Improvement Plan. Oversight may include support for continuous quality improvement, staff training, and data analysis. During the first two years of implementing the Program Improvement Plan, the Division shall ensure the three new Human Services/Planner Evaluator positions funded by this act are used to carry out the activities detailed in the Plan. Upon complete implementation of the Plan, these positions shall be used in child welfare services to continually improve outcomes for children and families.

      "The Division shall report on the implementation and outcomes of the Program Improvement Plan to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services. The report shall be submitted semiannually on February 1 and August 1 of each year, with the first report submitted on August 1, 2016, and the final report on February 1, 2019.

     <p>
      "(b) Statewide Strategic Plan.
   - The Division of Social Services shall develop a statewide strategic plan for child welfare services that complements the required federal Program Improvement Plan. The statewide strategic plan shall, at a minimum, address the findings of the North Carolina Statewide Child Protective Services Evaluation, which was conducted as required by Section 12C.1(f) of S.L. 2014-100, in the areas of county performance, caseload sizes, administrative structure, adequacy of funding, social worker turnover, and monitoring and oversight. The plan shall also address measures for ensuring that Native American children in this State are served in a culturally appropriate manner, including in placements for adoption and foster care.

     </p>
     <p>
      "Whereas, it has been challenging for the State to effectively supervise administration of complex social services programs in 100 counties and it would be more efficient and effective for the State to supervise fewer local agencies; and

      "Whereas, it is our charge to spend public dollars wisely and effectively on administration of public assistance; and
     </p>

      "(2) Resume requesting post-eligibility verification information for Medicaid applications received on or after September 1, 2020.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Make a good-faith effort to redetermine Medicaid eligibility for Medicaid beneficiaries who were due for an annual or other periodic renewal of Medicaid eligibility prior to September 1, 2020, but for whom recertification did not occur.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Make a good-faith effort to request post-eligibility verification information for Medicaid applications received prior to September 1, 2020, for which post-eligibility verifications have not been requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(b) In complying with the requirements of this section, county departments of social services shall not terminate benefits for a Medicaid beneficiary if doing so would result in the State being ineligible for the increased Medicaid funding under Section 6008 of P.L. 116-127. When a county department of social services identifies a case that would be subject to termination of Medicaid eligibility in the absence of the preceding requirement, the case shall be identified in the NC FAST system utilizing a uniform identifier to be established by the Department of Health and Human Services no later than July 31, 2020. Notices of termination for cases with the identifier shall be sent in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa04s108A-79" target="_self">G.S. 108A-79</a></cite> within 90 days after the expiration of the declared nationwide public health emergency as a result of the 2019 novel coronavirus.

      <p>
       Due Process Rights Not Violated.
   
   - North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services violated a mother's due process and equal protection rights because although the hearing officer's final decision came some time after the hearing date, the mother's children failed to take advantage of their statutory right to compel the hearing officer to take action; the children were afforded an adequate opportunity to have their concerns addressed in a timely manner, but merely failed to take advantage of that right, and their equal protection rights were not violated by the hearing officer's delay. Cloninger v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 345, 691 S.E.2d 127 (2010), review denied <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 324</cite>, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 1083 (2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Give Notice of Right to Counsel.
   
   - The omission of information concerning the right to counsel in the notice of termination of services under subsection (c) was a serious error; lack of assistance of counsel could have a major impact on the proceedings, and the notice fell short of the necessary specificity regarding the reasons for termination. King v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 376 S.E.2d 245 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Apprise Petitioner of Basis for Decision.
   
   - Use of the general language "continuing refusal to cooperate" did not sufficiently apprise the petitioner of the basis for the decision and seriously impaired his ability to rebut those grounds at the subsequent hearing. King v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 376 S.E.2d 245 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Standing to Appeal Eligibility Decision.
   
   - Daughter of deceased Medicaid recipient had no right to appeal from Department of Human Resources decision regarding her father's eligibility, as she was neither an "applicant" nor a "recipient," nor the legal representative of her father's estate. Yates v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 390 S.E.2d 761 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Standard of Review.
   
   - Superior court was required under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa04s108A-79ol1k" target="_self">G.S. 108A-79(k)</a></cite> to determine whether decisions by a hearing officer for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, regarding the denial of Medicaid emergency medical benefits for a claimant's hospitalizations, were factually and legally correct. Thus, the superior court properly made its own findings of fact, and conducted a de novo review to the extent it was functioning as an appellate court. Meza v. Div. of Soc. Servs., <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 668 S.E.2d 571 (2008), rev'd <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 61</cite>, 692 S.E.2d 96 N.C. LEXIS 343 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       The standard of review of an agency decision under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t108Aa04s108A-79ol1k" target="_self">G.S. 108A-79(k)</a></cite> is de novo when the superior court exercises its statutory authority to take testimony and examine into the facts of the case to determine whether the final decision is in error under federal and State law. If, however, the superior court proceeds solely upon the administrative record, the hearing is governed by the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba04s150B-51ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-51(b)</a></cite>, in which questions of fact are reviewed under the whole record test and questions of law are reviewed de novo.

       Omission of Information Concerning Right to Counsel Was Error.
   
   - The omission of information concerning the right to counsel in the notice of termination of services under subsection (c) was a serious error; lack of assistance of counsel could have a major impact on the proceedings, and the notice fell short of the necessary specificity regarding the reasons for termination; the general "continuing refusal to cooperate" does not sufficiently apprise the petitioner of the basis for the decision and seriously impairs his ability to rebut those grounds at the subsequent hearing; therefore, plaintiff's benefits were improperly terminated by the failure to follow prescribed statutory requirements for notice.

      <p>
       Findings of Fact Inadequate.
   
   - Work First benefits recipient's appeal of the affirmance of a reduction of her benefits was remanded to the trial court as the trial court's findings of fact related to the recipient's diabetic condition and her ability to work merely recited the evidence, did not articulate what the trial court considered to be the definition of disability in the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA), specifically 42 U.S.C.S.

   - Substantial competent evidence in the form of medical expert opinion supported a hearing officer's conclusion that a petitioner, a non-qualified alien, was entitled to Medicaid benefits for portions of two hospitalizations because the petitioner's condition met the definition of an emergency medical condition, under 42 U.S.C.S.

       Provisions Governing Appeals.
   
   - Appeals by applicants and recipients of public assistance or social services from adverse decisions of county agencies or boards are governed by the substantive provisions and procedural requirements of this section, including the procedural provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (G.S. 150B-1 et seq.), consistent with the statute, to the extent that substance and procedure are not in conflict with applicable federal law and regulations.

       - Given the detailed substantive provisions of this section, designed specifically to apply to appeals of county agency decisions, and the fact that the Administrative Procedure Act, by its terms, does not apply to such appeals, the legislature, by reference to such act, did not intend to substitute the act's substantive requirements for those of this section. The citation to the act simply indicated a legislative intent to incorporate the powers of hearing officers and the hearing procedures detailed in the act into subsection (i) of this section by reference.
