                    paid upon the temporary bonds or notes to be exchanged therefor, and shall cancel all such coupons; and upon such exchange such temporary bonds or notes and the coupons attached thereto, if any, shall be forthwith canceled by the Treasurer
                    of such agent. Until so exchanged, temporary bonds and notes issued under the authority hereof shall in all respects be entitled to all the rights and privileges of the definitive securities.

                    By and with the consent of the Council of State, the State Treasurer is authorized to issue and sell, from time to time, refunding obligations for the purpose of refunding outstanding obligations as and to the extent authorized by this Article. The principal
                    amount of any such refunding obligations shall not exceed the principal amount of outstanding obligations to be refunded unless (i) the refunding results in an aggregate debt service savings and (ii) the increase in the principal amount
                    issued does not create cash-in-hand available for new capital improvements.

                    Refunding obligations issued pursuant to the provisions of this Article shall not be subject to limitations imposed by any other law including, without limitation, the other Articles of this Chapter.
