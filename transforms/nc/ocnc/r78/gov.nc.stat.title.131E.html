       Funds for Case Management Pilot Program.
      </b> - Session Laws 2017-57, s. 11F.5A, provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly to reduce avoidable emergency department readmissions and emergency department boarding times among individuals with behavioral health
                    needs. To that end, of the funds appropriated to the Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000) in nonrecurring
                    funds for the 2017-2018 fiscal year shall be allocated for the development and establishment of a two-year pilot program at a hospital in Wake County to support a hospital-based, comprehensive community case management program. The
                    Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Mental Health, Developmental Disabilities, and Substance Abuse Services, in consultation with LME/MCOs responsible for the management and provision of mental health, developmental
                    disabilities, and substance abuse disorder services in Wake County under the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver, shall oversee the development and establishment of the pilot program to ensure it is designed to reduce avoidable emergency department
                    readmissions and emergency department boarding times among individuals with behavioral health needs. The pilot program shall be conducted at the hospital in Wake County with the largest number of emergency department visits that agrees
                    to participate in the two-year pilot program authorized by this subsection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "By December 1, 2020, the Department shall submit a report to the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee on Health and Human Services and the Fiscal Research Division evaluating the effectiveness of the pilot program in reducing avoidable emergency department
                    readmissions and emergency department boarding times among individuals with behavioral health needs."

                    Session Laws 2013-365, s. 9(a)-(e), provides: "(a) Definitions. - 'Electrical Requirements Rule' means 10A NCAC 13B.6227 (Licensing of Hospitals: Electrical Requirements) for purposes of this section and its implementation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) Electrical Requirements Rule. - Until the effective date of the revised permanent rule that the Medical Care Commission is required to adopt pursuant to Section 9(c) of this act, the Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services shall
                    implement the Electrical Requirements Rule, as provided in Section 9(c) of this act.

                <p>
                    "(c) Implementation. - Notwithstanding subdivision (2) of subsection (f) of the Electrical Requirements Rule, the Commission shall authorize facilities licensed by the Department to use bi-fuel generators that operate with both liquid fuel and natural
                    gas (methane) that is not stored on the site, provided that the natural gas is delivered via pipe or pipeline by a natural gas utility. These bi-fuel generators shall be exempt from liquid fuel capacity standards established by the
                    Commission. Bi-fuel generators that operate on both liquid and other gaseous fuels, including propane and butane, that are stored on the site shall also be authorized, provided that the combined capacity of both liquid and gaseous
                    fuels meet minimum on-site fuel requirements established by the Commission. The Commission may adopt rules to require a licensed facility with a bi-fuel generator to develop a contingency plan for liquid fuel delivery onto the site
                    in the event of a natural gas (methane) supply disruption.
                </p>

                    "(d) Additional Rule-Making Authority. - The Commission shall adopt a rule to replace the Electrical Requirements Rule. Notwithstanding <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba2As150B-19" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-19(4)</a></cite>,
                    the rule adopted by the Commission pursuant to this section shall be substantively identical to the provisions of Section 9(c) of this act.

       Hospital Authority Has Authority to Expand Number of Its Commissioners.
      </b> - This section expressly grants the authority to expand the number of a hospital authority's commissioners to the hospital authority's commissioners themselves, rather than to the board of county commissioners; therefore,
                    a resolution of a county board of commissioners which provided that the number of members to the board of commissioners of a hospital authority could not be changed except by resolution of the county board of commissioners was a nullity
                    and had no force and effect. See opinion of Attorney General to Haywood Regional Medical Center, 1999 N.C. AG LEXIS 40 (12/21/99).

                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1987, c. 856, s. 13 repealed <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea03s131E-55" target="_self">G.S. 131E-55</a></cite> to 131E-58.

                <p>
                    Session Laws 1987, c. 856, s. 20 provided that ss. 1 through 19 would be effective only upon agreement by Duke University to the terms of ss. 21 through 26 of the act and certification of that fact by the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources
                    to the Governor, and that ss. 12 to 17 would be effective on the date of the transfer. Section 20 further provided that any disputes arising out of the transfer would be resolved by the Director of Budget.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The letter of certification from the Secretary of the Department of Human Resources was dated October 5, 1988, but it appears that this was a typographical error and that October 5, 1987, was the correct date.

                <p>
                    Sections 21 through 26 of the act provided terms for the transfer of the Lenox Baker Hospital to Duke University.

                        Impact on Medical Liens. - Patient's evidence of a hospital's lien was admissible because, when the hospital chose to rely on the hospital's lien on the patient's expected judgment against an alleged tortfeasor instead of timely billing the patient's
                        health insurer, the hospital did not abandon the lien as (1) applicable statutes permitted this choice, and (2) a contrary interpretation frustrated the fair medical billing statute, which did not intend to force hospitals to bill
                        insurers when other payment sources were available, so the patient remained indebted to the hospital under the medical lien statute. Sykes v. Vixamar, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. App.</cite> 130, 830

                        Purpose. - Former G.S. 131-170 (similar to subsection (b) of this section) was enacted upon the theory that external access to peer investigations conducted by staff committees stifles candor and inhibits objectivity. It represents a legislative choice
                        between competing public concerns. It embraces the goal of medical staff candor at the cost of impairing plaintiffs' access to evidence. Cameron v. New Hanover Mem.

                        The public's qualified constitutional right to attend civil court proceedings did not preclude the trial court, under the facts presented, from giving effect to the protections of this section by sealing peer review materials and closing court proceedings

                        To the extent any questions a hospital director and nurse were ordered to answer were regarding information protected by the statute, the questions fell into the exception of the third category; by requiring responses to written interrogatories instead
                        of oral answers, the trial court gave counsel the opportunity to ensure a witness did not inadvertently disclose information beyond the scope of the question asked, and the trial court did not err in requiring the non-privileged

                        Trial court erred by ordering hospitals to produce documents to a deceased patent's estate because they demonstrated that the documents were privileged pursuant to the Hospital Licensure Act; the hospitals presented the affidavits of a director of medical

                    records of an inmate who received medical services while in custody shall be immune from liability in any civil action for the release of the inmate's medical record.

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 2001-385, ss. 2(a) through (e), provide: "Section 2.(a) The Department of Health and Human Services shall establish a Skilled Nursing Facility Quality Improvement Consultation Project to assist providers in
                    the development of quality improvement plans for each long-term care facility and program that offers skilled nursing services to the public. In order to avoid conflict with federal regulations, the Department shall locate the project
                    in a section of the Division of Facility Services [now the Division of Health Service Regulation] other than the Licensure and Certification Section. Project staff shall include nurses who have previous experience in long-term care.
                    Staff shall be available to all licensed nursing facilities and, upon request of the facility, shall provide on-site consultation in at least the following areas:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Analysis of recent survey results in order to assist the facility with its efforts to correct problems or deficiencies identified by the survey.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Training for in-house quality improvement programs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Specific area or issues of concern raised by the facility.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Best practices information. The Department may contract with a private entity to assist in the implementation of the project.

                <p>
                    "Section 2.(b) The Department of Health and Human Services shall offer joint training of survey team members and nursing home providers. The training shall be offered no fewer than two times per year, and subject matter of the training should be based
                    on one or more of the 10 deficiencies cited most frequently in the State during the immediately preceding calendar year. The joint training shall be designed to reduce inconsistencies experienced by providers in the survey process,
                    to increase objectivity by survey team members in conducting surveys, and to promote a higher degree of understanding between facility staff and survey team members in what is expected during the survey process.

                    "Section 2.(c) The Department of Health and Human Services shall require survey team members who have no previous nursing home experience to spend part of their basic training in a nursing home observing operations of the nursing home. On-site training
                    should be designed to provide the survey team member with experience in the actual operation of a nursing facility outside of the survey process and to achieve a general understanding of the following facility functions: administration,
                    nursing, personal care services, and dietary services. On-site training requirement shall be for a minimum of three days and must be completed before the survey team member assumes survey work or oversight responsibilities. In addition
                    to on-site training, at least fifty percent (50%) of the annual continuing education requirement of survey team members shall be in the subject area of geriatric care.

                    The Work Group shall do the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Clarify and provide guidance on terms applicable in the survey and oversight process to ensure uniformity. Terms that should be clarified include 'immediate jeopardy', 'harm', 'potential harm', 'avoidable', and 'unavoidable'. The Department shall
                    ensure that clarification of terms is included in basic and continuing survey training.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Identify rules that impede the direct care of patients and develop a proposal for repeal of those rules, including any necessary repeal of, or amendment to, current law that is the basis for the rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Examine possible incentives for providers such as extended survey period, increased reimbursement rates, accreditation, and deemed status. The Work Group shall consider all available quality measurements in developing recommendations for incentives.
                    The Work Group shall also identify changes in current law necessary to implement incentives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Explore aspects of quality assessment/monitoring that should be changed to facilitate improvements and determine if a waiver from the Health Care Financing Administration is necessary to implement innovative approaches to the delivery and monitoring
                    of long-term care in this State.

                        and review by the committee. No person who was in attendance at a meeting of the committee shall be required to testify in any civil action as to any evidence or other matters produced or presented during the proceedings of the
                        committee or as to any findings, recommendations, evaluations, opinions, or other actions of the committee or its members. However, information, documents, or records otherwise available are not immune from discovery or use in
                        a civil action merely because they were presented during proceedings of the committee. Documents otherwise available as public records within the meaning of G.S. 132-1 do not lose their status as public records merely because they
                        were presented or considered during proceedings of the committee. A member of the committee or a person who testifies before the committee may testify in a civil action but cannot be asked about the person's testimony before the
                        committee or any opinions formed as a result of the committee hearings.

        The Nursing Home Patients' Bill of Rights does not set the standard to which nursing homes are held accountable

                        care providers and speculate virtually without limits on the culpability of their conduct. Makas v. Hillhaven, Inc., 589 F. Supp. 736 (M.D.N.C. 1984).

                        The Nursing Home Patients' Bill of Rights is a laudable statement of policy and requirements imposed on licensed nursing homes, with a remedial enforcement scheme which provides for injunctive relief and/or license revocation and administrative penalties.
                        It may be relevant in a negligence case to show very generally a patient's expectations from a nursing home, but it is not a substitute, through the doctrine of negligence per se, for the well-established standard of care to be
                        applied in negligence actions for damages against health care providers. Makas v. Hillhaven, Inc., 589 F. Supp. 736 (M.D.N.C. 1984).

                    The Commission shall adopt rules to carry out the purpose of this Article. These rules shall be adopted with the advice of the State Emergency Medical Services Advisory Council and shall include the operation of a statewide trauma registry, statewide
                    educational requirements fundamental to the implementation of the trauma system. The rules adopted by the Commission shall establish guidelines for monitoring and evaluating the system including standards and criteria for the denial,
                    suspension, voluntary withdrawal, or revocation of credentials for trauma center designation, and the establishment of regional trauma peer review committees. Each regional trauma peer review committee shall be responsible for analyzing
                    trauma patient care data and outcome measures to evaluate the ongoing quality of patient care, system performance, and medical direction within the regional trauma system. The committee membership shall include physicians, nurses,
                    EMS personnel, trauma registrars, and hospital administrators. Review of medical records by the Trauma Peer Review Committee is confidential and protected under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143.html#t143a56s143-518" target="_blank">G.S. 143-518</a></cite>.

                        That the financing of health care, particularly the reimbursement of health services rendered by health service facilities, limits the effect of free market competition and government regulation is therefore necessary to control costs, utilization, and
                        distribution of new health service facilities and the bed complements of these health service facilities.

                        That the increasing cost of health care services offered through health service facilities threatens the health and welfare of the citizens of this State in that citizens need assurance of economical and readily available health care.

                    <li id="t131Ea09s131E-175ol13">
                        That, if left to the market place to allocate health service facilities and health care services, geographical maldistribution of these facilities and services would occur and, further, less than equal access to all population groups, especially those
                        that have traditionally been medically underserved, would result.

                        That access to health care services and health care facilities is critical to the welfare of rural North Carolinians, and to the continued viability of rural communities, and that the needs of rural North Carolinians should be considered in the certificate
                        of need review process.

                        That the proliferation of unnecessary health service facilities results in costly duplication and underuse of facilities, with the availability of excess capacity leading to unnecessary use of expensive resources and overutilization of health care services.

                        That the general welfare and protection of lives, health, and property of the people of this State require that new institutional health services to be offered within this State be subject to review and evaluation as to need, cost of service, accessibility
                        to services, quality of care, feasibility, and other criteria as determined by provisions of this Article or by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services pursuant to provisions of this Article prior to such services

                        That because State and county expenditures provide support for nearly three-quarters of the residents in adult care homes through the State County Special Assistance program, and excess bed capacity increases costs per resident day, it is in the public
                        interest to promote efficiencies in delivering care in those facilities by controlling and directing their growth in an effort to prevent underutilization and higher costs and provide appropriate geographical distribution.

                    short-term, inpatient behavioral health beds brought into operation with funds allocated under subsection (a) of this section. By December 1, 2020, the Department shall submit a report that includes a proposal for funding the recurring

                        North Carolina's certificate of need legislation shows that the North Carolina legislature was concerned about the unrelenting rise in the cost of health care, and about wasteful, duplicative major acquisitions by health care providers. North Carolina

                        In enacting the certificate of need law, the legislature found as facts that the forces of free market competition are largely absent in health care, and that government regulation is therefore necessary to control the cost, utilization, and distribution
                        of health services and to assure that less costly and more effective alternatives are made available. In re Denial of Request by Humana Hosp. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 338 S.E.2d

                        A certificate of need is not dependent upon the requirement for a license; in fact, the statutes governing licensure of ambulatory surgical facilities (G.S. 131E-145 et seq.) and those governing certificates of need for new institutional health services
                        (this section) are independent provisions. Christenbury Surgery Ctr. v. North Carolina HHS, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 531 S.E.2d 219 (2000).

                        evidence, and it did not exceed its statutory authority in using enhanced competition and consumer choice as key factors in a comparative analysis. Total Renal Care of N.C.

                        Denial of Certificate of Need Affirmed. - Branch office proposed by a hospice was not located within the service area of the hospice, and therefore the proposed branch office was a new institutional health service for which the hospice had to obtain a
                        certificate of need; moreover, the issuance of a "No Review" letter by the North Carolina DHHS, which resulted in the establishment of a new institutional health service without a prior determination of need, substantially prejudiced

                        the validity of a settlement DHHS entered into with an assisted living limited liability company (LLC), which gave the LLC a contractual right to develop adult care home beds, because the corporation did not demonstrate that they
                        were substantially prejudiced as a matter of law; even if DHHS had not entered the settlement, it could not have required the LLC to submit a certificate of need application in order to give the corporations the opportunity to
                        comment on the LLC's plans since the Certificate of Need Law, <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-175" target="_self">G.S. 131E-175</a></cite> et seq. was held to be inapplicable to the LLC's projects.

                        a CON to the group for a hospital project was reversed on appeal, because the DHHS failed to follow statutory procedure when it rejected an administrative law judge's recommendation to deny the CON applications of the group by
                        erroneously considering new evidence, which it had no statutory authority to do. Mooresville Hosp. Mgmt. Assocs. v. N.C. HHS, Div. of Facility Servs., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 611

                    process for LME applicants who prove readiness. The Department shall consult with stakeholders during the approval process. The waiver program shall include all Medicaid-covered mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance
                    abuse services. Expansion of the waiver is contingent upon approval by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2011-264, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2012-151, s. 13, provides: "(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) shall proceed with statewide restructuring of the management responsibilities for the delivery of services
                    for individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders through expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. It is the intent of the General Assembly that expansion of the 1915(b)/(c)
                    Medicaid Waiver will be completed by July 1, 2013, and will result in the establishment of a system that is capable of managing all public resources that may become available for mental health, intellectual and developmental disabilities,
                    and substance abuse services, including federal block grant funds, federal funding for Medicaid and Health Choice, and all other public funding sources. In implementing the restructuring and expansion authorized in this section, the
                    Department shall do all of the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Establish accountability for the development and management of a local system that ensures easy access to care, the availability and delivery of necessary services, and continuity of care for consumers in need of mental health, intellectual and developmental
                    disabilities, and substance abuse services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Maintain fidelity to the Piedmont Behavioral Health (PBH) demonstration model, a proven system for the operation of all public resources for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Designate an area authority for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services to assume responsibility for all aspects of Waiver management. The following operational models are acceptable:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "a. Merger model: A single larger LME is formed from the merger of two or more LMEs.

                <p>
                    "b. Interlocal agreement among LMEs: A single LME is identified as the leader for all Waiver operations, financial management, and accountability for performance measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Use managed care strategies, including care coordination and utilization management, to reduce the trend of escalating costs in the State Medicaid program while ensuring medically necessary care and deploy a system for the allocation of resources
                    based on the reliable assessment of intensity of need. The Department shall design these strategies to efficiently direct consumers to appropriate services and to ensure that consumers receive no more and no less than the amount of
                    services determined to be medically necessary and at the appropriate funding level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) As the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver expands statewide, phase out the current CAP-MR/DD Waiver as well as the utilization management functions currently performed by public and private contractors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) Design the Innovations Waiver in such a way as to serve the maximum number of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities within aggregate funding.

                </p>
                <p>
                    "c. Establish and maintain systems for ongoing communication and coordination regarding the care of individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders with other organized systems such as local
                    departments of social services, Community Care of North Carolina, hospitals, school systems, the Department of Juvenile Justice, and other community agencies.

                    to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. If any LME fails to comply with this requirement, or fails to meet performance requirements of an approved contract with the Department to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver, the Department
                    shall assign responsibility for management of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver on behalf of the noncompliant LME to an LME that is successfully operating the Waiver and successfully meeting performance requirements of the contract with
                    the Department. Those LMEs approved to operate the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver under an interlocal agreement must have a single LME entity designated as responsible for all aspects of Waiver operations and solely responsible for meeting
                    contract requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(d) County governments are not financially liable for overspending or cost overruns associated with an area authority's operation of a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. County governments are not financially liable for overspending or cost overruns of Medicaid

                    "(e) Providers of targeted case management under the CAP-MR/DD Waiver are qualified to provide the 1915(c) service known as Community Guide under the Innovations Waiver. During the first year of assuming responsibility for Waiver operations, LMEs shall
                    offer to contract with providers that were previously approved to provide targeted case management to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities under the CAP-MR/DD Waiver, for the provision of Community Guide services.

                        Capital Expenditure Defined. - The Certificate of Need (CON) Law defines a "capital expenditure" as an expenditure for a project, including but not limited to the cost of construction, engineering, and equipment which under generally accepted accounting
                        principles is not properly chargeable as an expense of operation and maintenance. Capital expenditure includes, in addition, the fair market value of an acquisition made by donation, lease, or comparable arrangement by which a
                        person obtains equipment, the expenditure for which would have been considered a capital expenditure under this Article if the person had acquired it by purchase. Mission Hosps., Inc. v. N.C. HHS,

                        Acquisition of Equipment. - An acquisition of equipment can occur by donation, lease, transfer or comparable arrangement. The prior Certificate of Need (CON) Law tied its requirement of a CON for the acquisition of a LINAC or CT scanner to the total cost
                        of the equipment. The amended CON Law, however, requires a CON prior to acquiring a LINAC or CT scanner, regardless of cost. The amended CON Law requires a CON prior to making an acquisition of a new institutional health service
                        by donation, lease or transfer, or comparable arrangement if the acquisition would have been a new institutional health service if it had been made by purchase. The definition of new institutional health services includes the acquisition

                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 2011-264, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 2012-151, s. 13, provides: "(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) shall proceed with statewide restructuring of the management responsibilities for the delivery of services
                    for individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders through expansion of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. It is the intent of the General Assembly that expansion of the 1915(b)/(c)
                    Medicaid Waiver will be completed by July 1, 2013, and will result in the establishment of a system that is capable of managing all public resources that may become available for mental health, intellectual and developmental disabilities,
                    and substance abuse services, including federal block grant funds, federal funding for Medicaid and Health Choice, and all other public funding sources. In implementing the restructuring and expansion authorized in this section, the
                    Department shall do all of the following:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(1) Establish accountability for the development and management of a local system that ensures easy access to care, the availability and delivery of necessary services, and continuity of care for consumers in need of mental health, intellectual and developmental
                    disabilities, and substance abuse services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(2) Maintain fidelity to the Piedmont Behavioral Health (PBH) demonstration model, a proven system for the operation of all public resources for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(3) Designate an area authority for mental health, developmental disabilities, and substance abuse services to assume responsibility for all aspects of Waiver management. The following operational models are acceptable:
                </p>
                <p>
                    "a. Merger model: A single larger LME is formed from the merger of two or more LMEs.

                <p>
                    "b. Interlocal agreement among LMEs: A single LME is identified as the leader for all Waiver operations, financial management, and accountability for performance measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(4) Use managed care strategies, including care coordination and utilization management, to reduce the trend of escalating costs in the State Medicaid program while ensuring medically necessary care and deploy a system for the allocation of resources
                    based on the reliable assessment of intensity of need. The Department shall design these strategies to efficiently direct consumers to appropriate services and to ensure that consumers receive no more and no less than the amount of
                    services determined to be medically necessary and at the appropriate funding level.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(5) As the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver expands statewide, phase out the current CAP-MR/DD Waiver as well as the utilization management functions currently performed by public and private contractors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(6) Design the Innovations Waiver in such a way as to serve the maximum number of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities within aggregate funding.

                <p>
                    "c. Establish and maintain systems for ongoing communication and coordination regarding the care of individuals with mental illness, intellectual and developmental disabilities, and substance abuse disorders with other organized systems such as local
                    departments of social services, Community Care of North Carolina, hospitals, school systems, the Department of Juvenile Justice, and other community agencies.

                    entities. However, LMEs that choose to subcontract managed care functions to other entities will be limited to the following:

                <p>
                    "(c) The Department shall require LMEs that have not been approved by the Department to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver by January 1, 2013, to merge with or be aligned through an interlocal agreement with an LME that has been approved by the Department
                    to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. If any LME fails to comply with this requirement, or fails to meet performance requirements of an approved contract with the Department to operate a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver, the Department
                    shall assign responsibility for management of the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver on behalf of the noncompliant LME to an LME that is successfully operating the Waiver and successfully meeting performance requirements of the contract with
                    the Department. Those LMEs approved to operate the 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver under an interlocal agreement must have a single LME entity designated as responsible for all aspects of Waiver operations and solely responsible for meeting
                    contract requirements.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(d) County governments are not financially liable for overspending or cost overruns associated with an area authority's operation of a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver. County governments are not financially liable for overspending or cost overruns of Medicaid
                    services associated with a county program or multicounty program's operation of a 1915(b)/(c) Medicaid Waiver beyond the county program or multicounty program's Medicaid risk reserve and Medicaid fund balance amounts.

                    "(e) Providers of targeted case management under the CAP-MR/DD Waiver are qualified to provide the 1915(c) service known as Community Guide under the Innovations Waiver. During the first year of assuming responsibility for Waiver operations, LMEs shall
                    offer to contract with providers that were previously approved to provide targeted case management to individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities under the CAP-MR/DD Waiver, for the provision of Community Guide services.

                        Opening of Branch Office Outside an Existing Service Area. - When a hospice's competitor contested the issuance of a "no review" letter to the hospice allowing the hospice to establish a branch facility in the county where the competitor operated, which
                        was not the county in which the hospice currently operated, the hospice was not entitled to summary judgment because the hospice's proposed branch was not within the hospice's current planning and service area, so the hospice was
                        required to obtain a certificate of need, and the issuance of a "no review" letter to the hospice substantially prejudiced the competitor, as it resulted in the establishment and licensure of "a new institutional health service"

                        "Major Medical Equipment." - It was properly determined that a cancer treatment provider's proposed acquisition of a linear accelerator did not require a certificate of need because the cost of the acquisition did not exceed the statutory threshold in

                        excluded from the acquisition cost, since the system was not essential to the operation of the accelerator, and (2) "general condition" costs and costs associated with building space to house a mechanical room and a mold room were
                        properly excluded, as the accelerator did not increase "general condition" costs, and the construction costs were part of the developer's base costs which were not attributable to the accelerator. Mission Hosps., Inc. v. N.C. HHS,

                        governed by the CON law; the type of equipment that the provider was to furnish to the facility was specifically enumerated under G.S. 131E-176(16)(f1), and the services agreement would give the facility possession of the equipment

                        Irreparable harm was shown by, among other things, the agreement itself, which stated that a breach would have resulted in irreparable harm. N.C. Baptist Hosp. v. Novant Health, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite>                        721, 673 S.E.2d 794 (2009).

                        Interpretation of Statute Reasonable. - Because the interpretation of the Department of Health and Human Services of similar proposals within the same service area was reasonable, and a permissible construction of the statute, the court of appeals was
                        required to defer to it. Total Renal Care of N.C. LLC v. North Carolina HHS, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 666, 776 S.E.2d 322 (2015).

                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 2001-242, s. 5, provides: "This act is effective when it becomes law [June 23, 2001]. This act shall not apply to any project which was not a new institutional health service as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-176" target="_self">G.S. 131E-176(16)</a></cite>                    prior to the effective date of this act and for which there has been a capital expenditure exceeding fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) or there was a legally binding obligation for a capital expenditure exceeding fifty thousand dollars
                    ($50,000) in effect on or before the effective date of this act and which was reasonably expected to be completed by December 31, 2002. A facility or office that was not licensed as an ambulatory surgical facility prior to the effective
                    date of this act shall not become an ambulatory surgical facility by virtue of the amendment set forth in Sections 1 and 2 of this act [which amended <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea06s131E-146" target="_self">G.S. 131E-146</a></cite>                    and 131E-176] and may not be licensed as an ambulatory surgical facility under Part D of Article 6 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.131E.html" target="_blank">Chapter 131E</a></cite> of the General Statutes without

                    <p>
                        Legislative Findings. - In enacting the certificate of need law, the legislature found as facts that the forces of free market competition are largely absent in health care, and that government regulation is therefore necessary to control the cost, utilization,
                        and distribution of health services and to assure that less costly and more effective alternatives are made available. In re Denial of Request by Humana Hosp. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite>                        637, 338 S.E.2d 139 (1986), decided under former G.S. 131-175 and 131-181.

                    <p>
                        Review of Data to Determine If Criteria for Nursing Facility Met. - For purposes of an application for a certificate of need for a nursing facility, the administrative law judge properly determined that the North Carolina Department of Health and Human
                        Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) had to utilize a look back period of 18 months preceding the date of the application's submission through the date of the Agency's decision
                        in order that the Agency did not disregard several months of quality of care data the Agency specifically required the applicants to report. AH N.C. Owner LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite>                        92, 771 S.E.2d 537 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Review of Criteria by Agency. - The certificate of need law does not contemplate that the agency will review any criteria competitively, and subsequently find one applicant nonconforming to a criterion simply because another applicant is found conforming,
                        as the intent of the legislature is to have the agency first ensure that each application comports with the statutory and regulatory criteria. Britthaven, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources,

                        Competitor showed no error in granting summary judgment for a certificate of need applicant's application because (1) the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (Agency) did not wrongly consider only the project's county, under
                        <cite
                            class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-183ol1a3" target="_self">G.S. 131E-183(a)(3)</a></cite>, (3a), (4), and (6), as the statute stated no geographical scope, and the Agency used an established practice of applying the Administrative Code to
                            fill this gap, so the Agency did not unreasonably interpret the statute, (2) the Agency's incorporation by reference of findings regarding multiple criteria did not fail to independently review each criterion, and (3) the applicant
                            adequately identified a funding source. Blue Ridge Healthcare Hosps. Inc. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 808 S.E.2d 271, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 382</cite>, 807 S.E.2d 567,

                        Deference Based on Specialized Knowledge of Agency. - Administrative law judge (ALJ) erred in failing to give deference to the reasonable explanation of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation,
                        Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) for its decision to exclude hospital-affiliated facilities from its calculation of the county average based on its specialized knowledge because the evidence presented at the hearing corroborated
                        the Agency's assertion that hospital-affiliated facilities typically had significantly fewer Medicaid patients than other skilled nursing facilities within Wake County and artificially skewed the county average. AH N.C. Owner LLC

                    <p>
                        Full Contested Case Hearing Not Precluded by the Statute. - In a Certificate of Need (CON) case, the CON Statute does not preclude a full contested case hearing where an ALJ recommended a summary judgment in a decision based only on each applicant's conformity
                        with the criteria in <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-183" target="_self">G.S. 131E-183</a></cite>. A full hearing protects the applicant's due process rights, allows the record to be fully developed,
                        and encourages judicial economy. Living Centers-Southeast, Inc. v. North Carolina HHS, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 532 S.E.2d 192 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Review of Criteria by Hearing Officer. - In a certificate of need case, the hearing officer may only consider evidence contained in an applicant's certificate of need application which was before the Certificate of Need Section when it made its initial
                        decision. Presbyterian-Orthopaedic Hosp. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 470 S.E.2d 831 (1996), discretionary review improvidently allowed,

                        When a provider contested granting a certificate of need to a competitor, no hearing was required to find if the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services complied with <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-183" target="_self">G.S. 131E-183</a></cite>                        because the provider showed no specific right prejudiced by a particular agency error.

                    <p>
                        Quality of Care Criterion. - Applicant for a certificate of need for a nursing facility did not purposefully exclude information concerning the quality of care record of its facilities outside of county because, although improper, the practice of the
                        North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) in the past had been to only examine an applicant's quality of care record within the service
                        area of the proposed project. AH N.C. Owner LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 771 S.E.2d 537 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Administrative law judge erred in summarily concluding that the applicant for a certificate of need for a nursing facility was nonconforming with the criterion regarding past quality of care because the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services,
                        Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) could have actually examined the quality of care provided by the applicant in the past as the applicant's actual record of providing care was available
                        to the Agency. AH N.C. Owner LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 771 S.E.2d 537 (2015).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Because the administrative law judge (ALJ) did not address the particular circumstances surrounding the substandard quality of care citations of an applicant for a certificate of need for a nursing facility, the ALJ erred in summarily concluding as a
                        matter of law in its final decision that the applicant had met its burden at the hearing of establishing that it had provided quality care in the past in its existing North Carolina facilities. AH N.C. Owner LLC v. N.C. HHS,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 771 S.E.2d 537 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Interpretation of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) that the quality of care criterion was not applicable to several of the applicants for a certificate
                        of need for a nursing facility simply because they did not have existing facilities in the county, although they had nursing care facilities in the State, was improper; there was no logical basis for disregarding the information
                        evidencing quality of care on a statewide level, and the Agency's policy actually contravened one of the primary purposes of the certificate of need laws. AH N.C. Owner LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite>                        92, 771 S.E.2d 537 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Health-Related Needs of Medicaid Recipients Criterion. - North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section (the Agency) did not err in finding that the application for a certificate
                        of need for a nursing facility was nonconforming with the criterion that the applicant meet the health-related needs of Medicaid recipients as the applicant's projection that 55.4% of its total patient days would be provided to
                        Medicaid recipients was inadequate in meeting the needs of the Medicaid population. AH N.C. Owner LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 771 S.E.2d 537 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Statutory Criteria Met. - A challenged, successful Certificate of Need application did not violate State and federal Medicaid regulations by overstating its projected Medicaid revenues, nor did it fail in financial feasibility, cost effectiveness, or
                        conformity to statutory criteria contained in this section. Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, Div. of Facility Servs., Certificate of Need Section, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite>                        568, 522 S.E.2d 96 (1999).

                    <p>
                        The N. C. Department of Health and Human Services adhered to the required procedures where it first analyzed each individual certificate of need application to determine the extent to which each application conformed to the statutory criteria, and then
                        entered exhaustive findings with respect to the relative merits of the applications, comparing Medicaid access, costs for services, operating costs, types of services, staffing, and location before concluding that the successful
                        application was comparatively superior. Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, Div. of Facility Servs., Certificate of Need Section, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite>                        568, 522 S.E.2d 96 (1999).

                        Decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services to award a certificate of need for new kidney dialysis machines to an applicant was affirmed as the agency's findings were supported by sufficient evidence, and it did not exceed its
                        statutory authority in using enhanced competition and consumer choice as key factors in a comparative analysis. Total Renal Care of N.C. LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 615

                    <p>
                        North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services properly issued a certificate of need to a hospital, for the hospital to construct an addition to the hospital, because the Department did not err in its interpretation of
                        <cite
                            class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-183ol1a13a" target="_self">G.S. 131E-183(a)(13)(a)</a></cite>. Furthermore, because it was impossible to conduct a comparison of the specific services proposed in the application, the Department was instead
                            required to apply the reason and purpose of the statute to the application, and the Department properly analyzed the application to determine whether the hospital provided adequate access to medically underserved populations.

                    <p>
                        Substantial evidence in the record supported the administrative law judge's conclusion that a corporation's proposed payor mix was reasonable and satisfied subsection (a)(5) because there was detailed evidence and testimony in the administrative record
                        regarding the reasonableness of the corporation's projected reimbursements for services; the corporation identified trends suggesting higher use of home hemodialysis by commercially insured patients. Total Renal Care of N.C. LLC

                    <p>
                        Because the evidence was sufficient for a reasonable mind to accept a corporation's projections, the administrative law judge's finding that the corporation satisfied subsection (a)(13)(c) was supported by substantial evidence; the corporation provided
                        data and projections showing that its in-center patients would be drawn from underserved populations and that it would provide services to all patients. Total Renal Care of N.C. LLC v. North Carolina HHS,

                        North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Healthcare Planning and Certificate of Need Section, properly approved an application for a certificate of need because substantial evidence supported the finding
                        that the application conformed with statutory criteria regarding the host site requirement and the reasonableness and adequacy of the applicant's projections. Furthermore, a purported rescission letter by a host site was not an

                        CON application was within the agency's statutory authority under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-183ol1a4" target="_self">G.S. 131E-183(a)(4)</a></cite>. Good Hope Health Sys., L.L.C. v. N.C.

                        Statutory Criteria Not Met. - Because a certificate of need (CON) application proposed the relocation of two operating rooms and added a third, the CON application provided a new institutional health service under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-176" target="_self">G.S. 131E-176(16)(u)</a></cite>,
                        which required the applicant to comply with the North Carolina State Medical Facilities Plan under <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-176" target="_self">G.S. 131E-176(16)(u)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="#t131Ea09s131E-183ol1a" target="_self">G.S. 131E-183(a)</a></cite>.

                        When the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Resources, Division of Facility Services, Certificate of Need Section, denied a health system's request for a certificate of need (CON) to build a hospital and granted a CON to the system's competitor,
                        competent evidence supported the agency's finding that, even though the system had previously been granted a CON for a different project, the system was not going to complete that project, and a requirement that the agency "consider"
                        the previously granted CON did not require the agency to find that the system would successfully develop the previously approved project and factor a hypothetical completed hospital into the agency's determinations regarding the
                        population to be served and the possibility of duplicative services. Good Hope Health Sys., LLC v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 658 S.E.2d 665, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 470</cite>,

                        Duplication of Services Not a Concern - The Department of Health and Human Services' finding that the successful Certificate of Need (CON) application conformed with subdivisions (a)(3), (4) and (6) of this section was supported by substantial evidence
                        where the applicant identified 34 of its own patients at another facility who expressed a willingness to transfer their treatment to the proposed facility; where such transfer would not result in a duplication of services but rather
                        better access for current patients; and where an evaluation of the alternatives - (1) relocating stations to develop a new facility at a new site, (2) expansion of the existing facility, and (3) doing nothing - revealed that opening
                        a new center was the most effective alternative although the competing CON applicant already serviced a dialysis center in the city of the proposed new site. Dialysis Care of N.C. L.L.C. v. North Carolina HHS, Div. of Facility

                        the agency was justified in concluding that only federally-approved stations should be considered when counting the number of existing stations.

                        to meet only pro-forma requirements in order to become licensed in North Carolina, simply because such evidence had not been utilized in the initial decision and because he was not yet a licensed physician in North Carolina, where
                        all the evidence indicated that he would be a licensed physician and thus eligible to participate in the project by the time the Certificate of Need would be issued.

                        Substantial Evidence Supported Conditional Approval. - Substantial evidence existed from which the agency could reasonably find that a Certificate of Need (CON) application for a dialysis center, as conditioned, conformed with Criterion 5 where the financial
                        backer agreed to carry out the project, and the bank's finance officer testified, after the conditional approval, that the backer had access to sufficient funds for their equity contribution. Dialysis Care of N.C. L.L.C. v. North

                        the conditions imposed, as required by Criterion 5, insured that the proposal was consistent with applicable criteria; and where there was substantial evidence from which the agency could reasonably find the application conditionally

                        Subdivision (a)(5) of this section did not require the submission of financial statements by the applicants; it merely required the Department of Human Resources to determine the availability of funds for the project from the entity responsible for funding,

                        Where a project is to be funded other than by the applicants, the application must contain evidence of a commitment to provide the funds by the funding entity; without such a commitment, an applicant cannot adequately demonstrate availability of funds
                        or the requisite financial feasibility. Retirement Villages, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 477 S.E.2d 697 (1996).

                        Sufficient evidence supported a finding of financial feasibility where the availability of a bank loan was properly evidenced by a letter of interest, where a loan shortfall could be covered by other personal assets, and where "the certificate of need
                        section did not rely on [the availability of a line of credit in the name of a deceased individual] in concluding that there were sufficient funds to finance [the] proposal." Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't

                        of the backers describing his "intent to carry out the proposed project" and an affidavit further affirming this intent, when added to evidence demonstrating the ability of the funding sources to provide the funds, were sufficient
                        to show commitment required by this section. Johnston Health Care Ctr., L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, Div. of Facility Servs., Certificate of Need Section, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite>                        307, 524 S.E.2d 352 (2000).

                        of Health and Human Services' finding that the applicant failed to establish the availability and commitment of funds required by this section. Johnston Health Care Ctr., L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, Div.

                        the agency found that they were "sufficiently clear" and "discernible." Retirement Villages, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 477 S.E.2d 697

                        on the basis of an application that was never shown to be conforming to all applicable criteria, its actions did not prejudice the applicant's competitor because the alleged mistakes and omissions, which were made under a settlement

                        tomography equipment in a geographic area, was "void as applied" to the facts because the rule required consideration of the health system's underutilization of such equipment in a hospital that was about to close in determining
                        whether to authorize the competitor to install such equipment in the hospital the competitor proposed for the area, and the system's underutilization was irrelevant to the area's need for such equipment, and

                        a CON to the group for a hospital project was reversed on appeal, because the DHHS failed to follow statutory procedure when it rejected an administrative law judge's recommendation to deny the CON applications of the group by
                        erroneously considering new evidence, which it had no statutory authority to do. Mooresville Hosp. Mgmt. Assocs. v. N.C. HHS, Div. of Facility Servs., <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 641, 611

                        excluded from the acquisition cost, since the system was not essential to the operation of the accelerator, and (2) "general condition" costs and costs associated with building space to house a mechanical room and a mold room were
                        properly excluded, as the accelerator did not increase "general condition" costs, and the construction costs were part of the developer's base costs which were not attributable to the accelerator. Mission Hosps., Inc. v. N.C. HHS,

                        office building" which did not require a CON, since the associated cost was less than $2,000,000, rather than a "health service facility," and (2) costs essential to the provider's proposed acquisition and operation of equipment
                        did not exceed $2,000,000. Mission Hosps., Inc. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 696, 696 S.E.2d 163 (2010).

                        Construed in pari materia, as they must be, this section and G.S. 131-186 must be read as providing that the Department shall exercise one of two options, within the review period, when dealing with an application for a certificate of need: (1) make a
                        decision to deny or approve the application, or (2) reject the application. HCA Crossroads Residential Ctrs. Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 573</cite>, 398

                    <p>
                        The limiting phrase "within the review period" in former subsection (b) of this section modified only the phrase "reject the application," and, therefore, the Department lost subject matter jurisdiction to reject an application when the review period
                        ended. HCA Crossroads Residential Ctrs. Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 573</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 466 (1990).

                        An exception to the former 90-day time limit mandated by the foregoing provision was contained in subsection (c) of this section. HCA Crossroads Residential Ctrs. Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 573</cite>,

                        Failure of Department to Act on Application Within Review Period to Be Deemed Approval. - The provisions of Article 9 must be construed as expressing the legislature's intent that the Department be deemed as a matter of law to have rendered a decision
                        to approve a certificate of need if the Department fails to act upon an application within the applicable review period. Thereafter, the Department retains subject matter jurisdiction only for the purpose of issuing the certificate
                        of need, which it is deemed to have decided to approve. A contrary interpretation of the certificate of need law would leave the applicant with no effective remedy for the Department's failure to comply with the statute. HCA Crossroads

                        Department of Health and Human Services did not violate the statute when it reviewed certificate-of-need applications in separate review periods because its schedules and review categories satisfied the statutory requirement that similar proposals in
                        the same service area be reviewed together; the agency explained why proposals seeking to move dialysis stations across county lines were not "similar" to proposals merely relocating stations within a county under the medical plan
                        established. Total Renal Care of N.C. LLC v. North Carolina HHS, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 666, 776 S.E.2d 322 (2015).

                    <p>
                        Time Limitation for Acting on Certificate of Need Is Jurisdictional. - Former statutory provisions clearly prescribed a mandatory maximum time limit of 150 days within which the Department must act on applications for certificates of need. To the extent
                        it was applicable, this time limit was jurisdictional in nature. HCA Crossroads Residential Ctrs. Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 573</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 466

                        Department of Human Resources is authorized to approve projects for fewer beds than are proposed by an applicant. The power to make such conditional approvals is discretionary, however, and not mandatory. Charter Pines Hosp. v. North Carolina Dep't of

                        Comments Did Not Constitute Unauthorized Amendment. - Where information provided by a successful applicant for a certificate of need (CON) neither changed its application nor had any impact on the agency's determination that the application met the statutory
                        criteria, its comments were not an unauthorized amendment to the application. Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, Div. of Facility Servs., Certificate of Need Section,

                    <p>
                        Conditioned Approval. - It was not erroneous for hearing officer to condition her approval of application for certificate of need upon information to be furnished later, rather than returning the case to analyst for further review, as this section authorizes
                        the Department to issue the certificate of need with or without conditions. In re Conditional Approval of Certificate of Need Application of Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp. of Am., <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C.

                    <p>
                        The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services may find that an application for a Certificate of Need is consistent with the statutory criteria while imposing conditions upon it, especially where those conditions (the provision of documentation
                        showing which financial backer would be responsible for the owner's equity portion of the capital expenses) were not essential to the application's approval. Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources,

                        Participation in Certificate of Need Application Process. - Branch office proposed by a hospice was not located within the service area of the hospice; therefore, a competing hospice provider that was already providing hospice services in the service
                        area could participate in the certificate of need application process by filing written comments and exhibits concerning the proposal. Hospice at Greensboro, Inc. v. N.C. HHS Div. of Facility Servs.,

                        Department's disapproval of pending applications after the maximum 150-day review period expired was a nullity and of no legal consequence. HCA Crossroads Residential Ctrs. Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources,

                        Sufficiency of the Evidence. - North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services did not err by denying a certificate of need (CON) application because, although there were arguments made at a public hearing in favor of the application, there was

                        Review of Criteria by Agency. - The certificate of need law does not contemplate that the agency will review any criteria competitively, and subsequently find one applicant nonconforming to a criterion simply because another applicant is found conforming,
                        as the intent of the legislature is to have the agency first ensure that each application comports with the statutory and regulatory criteria. Britthaven, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources,

                        Conditioned Approval. - The North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services may find that an application for a Certificate of Need is consistent with the statutory criteria while imposing conditions upon it, especially where those conditions (the
                        provision of documentation showing which financial backer would be responsible for the owner's equity portion of the capital expenses) were not essential to the application's approval. Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina

                        The N.C. Department of Health and Human Services adhered to required procedures where it first analyzed each individual certificate of need application to determine the extent to which each application conformed to the statutory criteria, and then entered
                        exhaustive findings with respect to the relative merits of the applications, comparing Medicaid access, costs for services, operating costs, types of services, staffing, and location before concluding that the successful application
                        was comparatively superior. Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina Dep't of Human Resources, Div. of Facility Servs., Certificate of Need Section, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 568,

                        a CON to the group for a hospital project was reversed on appeal, because the DHHS failed to follow statutory procedure when it rejected an administrative law judge's recommendation to deny the CON applications of the group by

                        provision of documentation showing which financial backer would be responsible for the owner's equity portion of the capital expenses) were not essential to the application's approval. Burke Health Investors, L.L.C. v. North Carolina

                        When the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Health Service Regulation, Certificate of Need Section, withdrew a "no review" decision that a hospital did not require a certificate of need to reallocate beds between the hospital's
                        inpatient and emergency departments, a contest brought by competitors was not rendered moot because the exception for disputes that were capable of repetition yet evaded review applied, as (1) the withdrawal was too short in duration
                        to permit full litigation, and (2) it was reasonable to conclude that similarly situated parties would be subject to such withdrawals in the future. Cumberland Cnty. Hosp. Sys. v. North Carolina HHS,

                        correctly dismissed its initial attempt to appeal directly to the Court of Appeals. The fact that the appeal came to the Court of Appeals as an appeal from the dismissal of a previous appeal did not alter the application of the

                        When providers contested an agency's decision to let a competitor move specialty operating rooms to the providers' area, the agency's alleged failure to follow the agency's rules did not establish the providers' substantial prejudice as a matter of law
                        because the providers also had to show the agency deprived the providers of property, ordered the providers to pay a fine or penalty, or otherwise substantially prejudiced the providers' rights. Surgical Care Affiliates, LLC v.
