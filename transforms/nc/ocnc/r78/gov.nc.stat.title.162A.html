                    Editor's Note. - Session Laws 1989, c. 708, s. 2, provided: "(a) Any contract made or entered into, prior to the date of ratification of this Act, by a city, a county, or a water and sewer authority created under Article 1 of
                    <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.162A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 162A</a></cite> of the General Statutes which would have been valid under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa03s160A-20" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-20</a></cite>,
                    subsections (a), (b), (c), and (f), as rewritten by this Act, is hereby validated, ratified, and confirmed. Furthermore, such a contract may not be held invalid because it contains a nonsubstitution clause, or because no public hearing
                    was advertised and held on the contract, or both.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) Any contract made or entered into, prior to the date of ratification of this Act, by a city, a county, or a water and sewer authority created under Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.162A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 162A</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes which would have been valid under subsection (a) of this Section 2 or under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa03s160A-20" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-20</a></cite> as it existed prior
                    to the ratification of this Act or as rewritten by this Act, except that the Local Government Commission did not approve the contract, is hereby validated, ratified, and confirmed."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Act was ratified August 1, 1989.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Session Laws 1989, c. 708, s. 3 provided: "Nothing in this Act shall be interpreted to limit or restrict the authority of cities, counties, or water and sewer authorities created under Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.162A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 162A</a></cite>                    of the General Statutes to purchase, improve, or finance the purchase or improvement of real or personal property pursuant to any other applicable law, whether general, special, or local."

                <p>
                    Session Laws 2013-413, s. 34(a)-(d), as amended by Session Laws 2014-120, s. 53, provides: "(a) 15A NCAC 18A .1949(b) (Sewage Flow Rates for Design Units). - Until the effective date of the revised permanent rule that the Commission is required to adopt
                    pursuant to Section 34(c) of this act, the Commission, the Department, and any other political subdivision of the State shall implement 15A NCAC 18A .1949(b) (Sewage Flow Rates for Design Units) as provided in Section 34(b) of this
                    act.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "(b) Implementation. - Notwithstanding the Daily Flow for Design rates listed for dwelling units in 15A NCAC 18A .1949(a) or for other establishments in Table No. 1 of 15A NCAC 18A .1949(b)(Sewage Flow Rates for Design Units), a wastewater system shall
                    be exempt from the Daily Flow for Design, and any other design flow standards that are established by the Department of Health and Human Services or the Commission for Public Health provided flow rates that are less than those listed
                    in 15A NCAC 18A .1949 (Sewage Flow Rates for Design Units) can be achieved through engineering design that utilizes low-flow fixtures and low-flow technologies and the design is prepared, sealed, and signed by a professional engineer
                    licensed pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.089C.html" target="_blank">Chapter 89C</a></cite> of the General Statutes. The Department and Commission may establish, by rule, lower limits on
                    reduced flow rates as necessary to ensure wastewater system integrity and protect public health, safety, and welfare, provided that the Commission relies on scientific evidence specific to soil types found in North Carolina that the
                    lower limits are necessary for those soil types. Rules adopted pursuant to this section shall become effective as provided in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba2As150B-21.3" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-21.3(b1)</a></cite>                    as though 10 or more written objections had been received as provided by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba2As150B-21.3" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-21.3(b2)</a></cite>. Proposed daily design flows for wastewater

                        water delivered or made available or expected to be delivered or made available by the authority, regardless of whether treated water is actually delivered or made available. Such payments may be designed to cover the authority's

                        time be available from facilities of the authority. The participating political subdivisions may agree to make such payments from limited or specified sources. To the extent such payments relate to debt service of the authority
                        and related amounts, they may not be made from any moneys derived from exercise by the participating political subdivisions of their taxing power, and such payment obligations shall not constitute a pledge of such taxing power.

                        The participating political subdivisions may also secure such payment obligations with a pledge of or lien upon any such sources of payment. Notwithstanding the provisions of G.S. 162A-9 or any other law to the contrary, an authority
                        entering into any such agreement need not fix rates, fees and other charges for its services except as provided herein, and such rates, fees and charges need not be uniform through the authority's service areas. Notwithstanding
                        the provisions of G.S. 160A-322 or any other law to the contrary, agreements described herein may have a term not exceeding 50 years. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, the execution and effectiveness of any agreement authorized

                    from the property, the characteristics of the watershed into which stormwater from the property drains, and other factors that affect the stormwater drainage system. Rates, fees, and charges imposed under this subsection for stormwater
                    management programs and stormwater and drainage system service may not exceed the authority's cost of providing a stormwater management program and a structural and natural stormwater and drainage system. The authority's cost of providing
                    a stormwater management program and a structural and natural stormwater and drainage system includes any costs necessary to assure that all aspects of stormwater quality and quantity are managed in accordance with federal and State
                    laws, regulations, and rules.

                <p>
                    No stormwater utility fee may be levied under this subsection whenever two or more units of local government operate separate stormwater management programs or separate structural and natural stormwater and drainage system services in the same area within
                    a county. However, two or more units of local government may allocate among themselves the functions, duties, powers, and responsibilities for jointly operating a stormwater management program and structural and natural stormwater
                    and drainage system service in the same area within a county, provided that only one unit may levy a fee for the service within the joint service area. For purposes of this subsection, a unit of local government shall include a regional
                    authority providing stormwater management programs and structural and natural stormwater and drainage system services.

                        Liability of City for Hydrant Fees. - Even absent statutory or express contractual liability to pay for fire protection, justice and equity required city to pay fire hydrant fees to a water and sewer authority where the authority intended to maintain
                        hydrants for the city's use, the city granted a 60-year franchise to the authority to install and maintain hydrants, free service was explicitly proscribed, the city knew of the hydrant charges, and the city paid such charges until
                        the rate was increased. The law would imply a promise by the city to pay for such service. Otherwise, it would be unjustly enriched at the expense of the authority. Orange Water &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Town of Carrboro,

                <p>
                    The Legislative Research Commission was directed by Senate Resolution 875 of the 1969 General Assembly to study and report to the 1971 General Assembly on the need for legislation "concerning local and regional water supplies (including sources of water,
                    and organization and administration of water systems)." Pursuant to said Resolution a report was prepared and adopted by the Legislative Research Commission in 1970 concerning local and regional water supplies. In this report the Legislative
                    Research Commission made the following findings concerning the need for planning and developing regional water supply systems in order to provide adequate supplies of high quality water to the citizens of North Carolina, of which the
                    General Assembly hereby takes cognizance:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li id="t162Aa02s162A-21ol11">
                        The existing pattern of public water supply development in North Carolina is dominated by many small systems serving few customers. Of the 1,782 public water systems of record on July 1, 1970, according to Department of Health and Human Services statistics,
                        over eighty percent (80%) were serving less than 1,000 people each. These small systems are often underfinanced, inadequately designed and maintained, difficult to coordinate with nearby regional systems, and generally inferior
                        to systems serving larger communities as regards adequacy of source, facilities and quality. The situation which has developed reflects a need for better planning at both State and local levels.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t162Aa02s162A-21ol12">
                        The State's population balance is steadily changing. Sparsely populated counties are losing residents to the more densely populated counties, while the State's total population is increasing. As this trend continues, small towns and communities will find
                        it increasingly difficult to build and maintain public water supply systems. Also, as urban centers expand, and embrace relatively large geographical areas, economic factors will dictate that regional water systems be developed
                        to serve these centers and to meet the demands of commercial and industrial development. It is estimated that countywide or regional water systems are needed now by 50 counties.
                    </li>
                    <li id="t162Aa02s162A-21ol13">
                        If the future public water supply needs of the State are to be met, a change in the existing pattern of public water supply development and management must be undertaken. Regional planning and development is an immediate need. The creation of countywide
                        or regional water supplies, with adequate interconnections, is necessary in order to provide an adequate supply of high quality water to the State's citizens, to make supplies less vulnerable to recurring drought conditions, and
                        to have systems large enough to justify the costs of adequate facilities and of proper operation and maintenance.

                        The State should provide a framework for comprehensive planning of regional water supply systems, and for the orderly coordination of local actions, so as to make the most efficient use of available water resources and economies of scale for construction,
                        operation and maintenance. The State should also provide financial assistance to local governments and regional authorities in order to assist with the cost of developing comprehensive regional plans, and countywide plans compatible
                        with a regional system.

                    for regulating surface water withdrawals and the statewide plan for water resources development projects; and (vi) ensure that potential interstate conflicts related to water resources are avoided or minimized. In the conduct of this

                    For the purposes of this Article "regional sewage disposal system" is defined as a public sewage disposal system of a municipality, county, sanitary district, or other political subdivision of the State, or combination thereof, which provides, is intended
                    to provide, or is capable of providing adequate collection, treatment, purification and disposal of sewage to a substantial portion of the population within a county, or a region composed of all or parts of two or more counties, or
                    to a metropolitan area in two or more counties. "Comprehensive planning" is defined as that planning which is a prerequisite for qualifying for receipt of federal and/or State grant funds for preparation of plans and specifications
                    and for actual construction of regional sewage disposal systems.

                        An ordinance may provide that its violation shall subject the offender to a civil penalty of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) to be recovered by the district in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender does not pay the penalty within
                        a prescribed period of time after he has been cited for violation of the ordinance. Any person assessed a civil penalty by the district shall be notified of the assessment by registered or certified mail, and the notice shall specify
                        the reasons for the assessment. If the person assessed fails to pay the amount of the assessment to the district within 30 days after receipt of notice, or such longer period, not to exceed 180 days, as the district may specify,
                        the district may institute a civil action in the General Court of Justice of the county in which the violation occurred or, in the discretion of the district, in the General Court of Justice of the county in which the person assessed
                        has his or its principal place of business, to recover the amount of the assessment. The validity of the district's action may be appealed directly to General Court of Justice in the county in which the violation occurred, or may
                        be raised at any time in the action to recover the assessment. Neither failure to contest the district's action directly nor failure to raise the issue of validity in the action to recover an assessment precludes the other.

                        a prescribed period of time after he has been cited for violation of the ordinance. Any person assessed a civil penalty by the district shall be notified of the assessment by registered or certified mail, and the notice shall specify
                        the reasons for the assessment. If the person assessed fails to pay the amount of the assessment to the district within 30 days after receipt of notice, or such longer period, not to exceed 180 days, as the district may specify,
                        the district may institute a civil action in the General Court of Justice of the county in which the violation occurred or, in the discretion of the district, in the General Court of Justice of the county in which the person assessed
                        has his or its principal place of business, to recover the amount of the assessment. The validity of the district's action may be appealed directly to General Court of Justice in the county in which the violation occurred or may
                        be raised at any time in the action to recover the assessment. Neither failure to contest the district's action directly nor failure to raise the issue of validity in the action to recover an assessment precludes the other.

                        Purpose. - The very purpose of G.S. 162A-88 is to clarify that a county water and sewer district created pursuant to G.S. 162A-86 is effectively a municipal corporation. Homebuilders Ass'n v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 37</cite>,

                        Broad Powers Granted to Water and Sewer Districts. - The legislature has granted broad powers to water and sewer districts, some of which are set forth in this section. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>,
                        398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).

                    <p>
                        District court properly concluded that the collection of impact fees from the developer was ultra vires where the phrase "to be furnished" in G.S. 162A-88 was to be construed in the context of the developer's needs, which meant that the developer could
                        expect that it would have water and sewer services within a reasonable time after it completed the construction of the houses, but even 10 years after the developer first sought its permits, neither the district nor the authority
                        had taken any steps to provide service. Tommy Davis Constr., Inc. v. Cape Fear Pub. Util. Auth., 807 F.3d 62 (4th Cir. 2015).

                        county, as operator of a public enterprise, is clothed with those powers set forth in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 153A</a></cite>, Article 15, including the power to mandate
                        connections and to fix charges for those connections under G.S. 153A-284. The plain wording of G.S. 153A-284 clearly supports this conclusion. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475

                        Power of County to Exercise Rights, Powers and Functions Granted to Water and Sewer Districts. - Pursuant to an interlocal cooperative agreement and pursuant to authority granted in Article 15 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.153A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 153A</a></cite>,
                        a county may, among other things, operate a water and/or sewer system for and on behalf of another unit of local government, such as a water and sewer district, and in conjunction therewith may exercise those rights, powers, and

                        Financing a Project by Charging for Services "To Be Furnished." - A local government is not required to use an assessment procedure to finance a project, and a sewer district may effectively finance a project through its authority to charge for services

                    <p>
                        Annexation of Water and Sewer District. - Trial court did not err in holding that city could lawfully annex part of water and sewer district, even though a water and sewer district under this chapter is termed a municipal corporation; a water and sewer
                        district is a municipal corporation organized for a special purpose, which does not qualify as a municipal corporation for purposes of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 160A</a></cite>.
