                        Public Statute Admissible. - Where the public printer has published a certain act with other public acts of the General Assembly, it is made, presumptively at least, a part of the public laws of the State, and every person having occasion to do so has
                        the right to read it in evidence in any court of the State as the law. Wrought Iron Range Co. v. Carver, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 328</cite>, 24 S.E. 352 (1896).

                    <p>
                        Private Statute Not Admissible. - The statute incorporating the North Carolina Railroad Company was a private act, and it was error to permit it to be read and commented on to the court or jury until it had been properly introduced as evidence. Town of
                        Durham v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 399</cite>, 12 S.E. 1040, 13 S.E. 1 (1891).

                    <p>
                        Whether the statute, or some enactment in it, is public or private, is a question of law, which the court must determine, in the absence of statutory enactment declaring and settling its nature. Town of Durham v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R.,

                        Journal of Legislature. - A copy of the journal of the legislature deposited with the Secretary of State is not evidence for any purpose. It is the journal, which is the original, which is to be filed in the office of the Secretary of State, and it is
                        this original or an exemplification made therefrom by him which, when competent, is to be used in evidence. Wilson v. Markley, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 616</cite>, 45 S.E. 1023 (1903).

                        Judicial Notice of Certain Regulations. - Where neither of the promulgating agencies is subject to the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (G.S. 150B-1 et seq.), the court is only required to take judicial notice of their regulations if submitted
                        in accordance with certain procedures designed to insure their accuracy. Southern Ry. v. O'Boyle Tank Lines, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 318 S.E.2d 872 (1984).

                        Prior to the enactment of G.S. 8-4, when any question arose as to the law of any other state or territory, or of the United States, or of any foreign country, the parties were required to prove such law. Gooch v. Faucett,

                        Presumption as Regards Common Law. - In the absence of proof to the contrary, the common law will generally be presumed to be in force in a sister state, except in those states whose jurisprudence is not founded on the common law. Miller v. Atlantic C.L.R.R.,

                        What Common Law Is as Question for Jury. - Where the common law of another state is proved, the court must leave the evidence of what that law is to the jury and cannot inform them what the law is. Moore v. Gwynn, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. 187</cite>                        (1844).

                    <p>
                        Certificate of Secretary of State as Evidence. - The certificate of the Secretary of State, in relation to the statutes of another state, given in pursuance of this section is evidence in criminal and civil cases. State v. Patterson,

                        Publication of Foreign Laws Admissible. - A book purporting to be the publication of the statute laws of another state, and to be published by the authority of such state, is admissible as evidence of such laws. Copeland v. Collins,

                    <p>
                        Admissibility of Printed Copy of Foreign Laws. - By the terms of this section, a printed copy of the acts of the legislature of another state is admissible in the courts of this State to prove the statute law of such other state. Under the law as it stood
                        prior to the enactment of this section, a printed copy of the acts of the legislature of a foreign state was not admissible in evidence. State v. Behrman, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 797</cite>, 19 S.E.

                    <p>
                        While a copy of a foreign homicide statute was admissible as evidence of the statutory law of the foreign state under G.S. 8-3(a), the State presented no evidence that the statute was unchanged from the version of the statute under which defendant was
                        convicted; thus, the State failed to show that defendant's prior conviction was substantially similar to an offense in North Carolina. State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 595

                        United States Agricultural Regulations Judicially Noticed. - The regulations of the United States Department of Agriculture concerning the transportation of cattle are not foreign laws within the meaning of this section, and the courts are required to
                        take judicial notice of them. State v. Southern Ry., <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 846</cite>, 54 S.E. 294 (1906).

                    <p>
                        The law of another state may be proven in transitory actions brought in the courts of this State by witnesses learned in the law of such other state, and by its authorized statutes and reports of decisions of its courts of last resort, and when properly
                        offered in evidence they must be interpreted by our courts as matters of law. Howard v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 574</cite>, 158 S.E. 101 (1931).

                    <p>
                        Necessity of Instructions to Jury. - Where the foreign law has been proved it is the duty of the court to instruct the jury as to the meaning of the law, its applicability to the case at hand, and its effect on the case, and it is error to refer the whole
                        case to the jury without instructions. Hooper v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. 130</cite> (1857).

                        Sua Sponte Notice of Law of Foreign Countries. - When State courts are confronted with cases involving questions of the law of foreign countries, this section requires that they, sua sponte, take notice of such law. La Grenade v. Gordon,

                        The party seeking to have the law of a foreign jurisdiction applied has the burden of bringing such law to the attention of the court. If the foreign jurisdiction has no law, either statutory or decisional, on the question involved, the courts of this
                        State will not speculate on what law such jurisdiction might adopt and will apply the law of North Carolina. Leonard v. Johns-Manville Sales Corp., <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 91</cite>, 305 S.E.2d 528

                        Because all of the lease agreements and purchase agreements involved in a case designated Florida law as the governing law for interpretation of the documents, even though the parties did not mention Florida law, the appellate court took judicial notice
                        of Florida law and used Florida law to resolve any substantive issues. Press v. AGC Aviation, LLC, - N.C. App. - , 817 S.E.2d 445 (2018).

                        failure of the complaint to allege that the cause of action survived under the laws of the state in which it arose did not render the complaint demurrable. Suskin v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 333</cite>,

                        When Certification Unnecessary. - The certification of a town ordinance as required by this section, was only prima facie evidence of its existence, and this was unnecessary when the ordinance had been proven by the production of the official records
                        of the town by the proper officer, which showed its passage. State v. Razook, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 708</cite>, 103 S.E. 67 (1929).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence Insufficient to Rebut Prima Facie Case. - When the defendant, convicted of the violation of a city ordinance, on appeal introduced in evidence the minutes of the meeting of the governing authorities of the town held on the date when the purported
                        ordinance was alleged to have been adopted, which did not show its passage on that date, it was not conclusive that the ordinance had not been passed at some other time, against the statutory certificate of the mayor that it was
                        in existence at the time of the defendant's conviction. State v. Gill, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 425</cite>, 142 S.E. 328 (1928).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        No Evidence of Certification or Publication. - The refusal to permit police officer to testify on cross-examination as to existence and contents of a paper-writing which purported to be an ordinance of the city, was not error where there was no evidence
                        that purported ordinance had been certified, as required by this section, or that it had been printed and published by the city as provided in G.S. 160-272 (now repealed). Toler v. Savage, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 208</cite>,

                        This section is not applicable when the original instrument is offered in evidence with the certificate of the register of deeds appearing thereon with respect to the time filed for registration and the book and page where it has been registered and the
                        date of such registration. State v. Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 391</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 630 (1965).

                    <p>
                        Signature of Clerk Essential. - The failure of the clerk (now the register of deeds) to sign his name to the certificate for registration, a requirement found in the provisions of G.S. 47-14, renders the instrument inadmissible as evidence under this
                        section. Woodlieff v. Woodlieff, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 634</cite>, 135 S.E. 612 (1926).

                        The record of a registered deed is competent evidence without producing the original where no rule of court for the production of the original has been issued. Ratliff v. Ratliff, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 425</cite>, 42 S.E.

                        The "registry" or copy of the record of a bond to make title to land made by a deceased person, under which a deed had been made by the administrator of said obligor, was within the spirit and meaning of this section, and was admissible without accounting
                        for the absence of the original. Doe v. Shelton, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. 370</cite> (1854).

                    <p>
                        Copy of Record of Clerk's Bond. - Inasmuch as the duly certified copy of the record of any instrument required to be registered was admissible as full and sufficient evidence of such instrument, and as the register of deeds was required to register and
                        keep the bond of the superior court clerk, a duly certified copy of the record of such bond was competent evidence of its provisions. State ex rel. Battle v. Baird, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 854</cite>,

                    <p>
                        Lack of Seal No Effect. - A copy of a grant from the register's office, which affirmatively showed that it was issued under the great seal of the State, was admissible in evidence, though the registry did not show the impress of the seal, or scroll to
                        indicate it. And while the seal may have been necessary to authenticate the grant, it would be presumed to have been affixed as required by law. Aycock v. Raleigh &amp; Augusta Air-Line R.R., <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 321</cite>                        (1883).

                    <p>
                        Production of Original to Correct Mistakes. - The original deed may be shown in evidence to correct an omission by the register of deeds of the signature of the justice of the peace before whom the deed was acknowledged. Brown v. Hutchinson,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">155 N.C. 205</cite>, 71 S.E. 302 (1911).

                    <p>
                        Parol Evidence to Explain Variance. - Where the original deed was lost, and it was contended that there was a material variance between the certified copy and the original deed, parol evidence to prove the correct description contained in the original
                        instrument was rejected, this section being construed as to have no application to such a case. Hooper v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 418</cite>, 16 S.E. 626 (1892).

                        Time and Manner of Objecting. - A party against whom the registry of a deed (or other instrument), or a copy thereof has been introduced in evidence, cannot then raise the objection that there is a variance between such registry, or copy, and the original
                        instrument; if he desired to avail himself of such objection he should have required the production of the original in the way provided by this section. Devereux v. McMahon, <cite class="nc_code">108 N.C. 134</cite>,

                <p>
                    Whenever any person owns several tracts of land which are contiguous or adjoining, but held under different deeds and different surveys, it may be lawful for any such person to have all such bodies of land included in one common survey by running around
                    the lines of the outer tracts, and thereupon the possession of any part of said land covered by such common survey shall be deemed and held in law as a possession of the whole and every part thereof: Provided, that nothing in this
                    section shall be construed to affect the rights or claims of persons which have already accrued to any part of said land. In all cases where such common surveys are made as directed by this section, the same may be recorded and registered
                    as in cases of deeds, and shall be evidence in like manner.

                    <p>
                        "Copy" Defined. - A copy, within the meaning of this section, is a transcript of the original, i.e., a writing exactly like another writing. State v. Champion, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 987</cite>, 21 S.E. 700 (1895); Wiggins
                        v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 67</cite>, 94 S.E. 685 (1917).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Certification of Copy. - The power of an officer, who is the keeper of certain public records, to certify copies is confined to a certification of their contents as they appear by the records themselves, and the records must, therefore, be so certified,
                        for he has no authority to certify to the substance of them, nor that any particular fact, as a date, appears on them. Wiggins v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 67</cite>, 94 S.E. 685 (1917).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Original Record Is Admissible. - This section does not prevent the admission in evidence of the original record itself. State v. Voight, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 741</cite> (1884); State ex rel. Carolina Iron Co. v. Abernathy,
                        <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 545</cite> (1886). See State v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 829</cite> (1886); Charles S. Riley &amp; Co. v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 334</cite>, 81 S.E. 414 (1914); Blalock
                        v. Whisnant, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 417</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 130 (1939).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While certified copies of records are admitted in evidence, the originals are not thereby made incompetent. State v. Joyner, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 55</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 367 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And Copy Is Admissible Where Original Is Lost. - Where a superior court record is lost, a certified copy of the transcript of the same in the appellate court is sufficient evidence of the record. Aiken v. Lyon, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 171</cite>,
                        37 S.E. 199 (1900).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A certified copy of a petition in a suit was admissible in evidence upon proof of the loss of the original records. Weeks v. McPhail, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. 130</cite>, 38 S.E. 472, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 73</cite>,
                        39 S.E. 732 (1901).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But Certified Statement Not Admissible. - This section makes competent only the "copies" of official records, etc., and a mere certified statement from the register's office was only evidence of the correctness of the record, and could not be admitted
                        in evidence in place of the original record. State v. Champion, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 987</cite>, 21 S.E. 700 (1895); Wiggins v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 67</cite>, 94 S.E. 685 (1917).

                    <p>
                        Incriminating Evidence Contained in Document. - Where the document admitted under the provisions of this section contains incriminating evidence, the defense often interposed by the accused is that to admit such paper would be in violation of the constitutional
                        right of the defendant on trial for crime to have opportunity to confront his accusers and the witnesses offered to sustain the charge. It is settled, however, that this section is not violative of this constitutional right, since
                        these provisions constitute a well-recognized exception to the privilege given by the Constitution. State v. Behrman, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 797</cite>, 19 S.E. 220 (1894); State v. Dowdy,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">145 N.C. 432</cite>, 58 S.E. 1002 (1907).

                    <p>
                        Admissibility of "Written Hearsay". - North Carolina countenances the introduction of test results, certified copies of official documents and records, as well as other writings, which, but for statute or decisional authority, would be written hearsay.
                        In re Arthur, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 218 S.E.2d 869 (1975), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 640</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 614 (1977).

                        Document Reclassifying Prisoner's Status. - An authenticated copy of a department of correction document reclassifying a person's status as a prisoner and disclosing that he had been removed from the work release program for having returned therefrom
                        in a highly intoxicated condition was a relevant and properly certified copy of an official record and was admissible in action to terminate parental rights. In re Bradley, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite>                        475, 291 S.E.2d 800 (1982).

                    All copies of bonds, contracts, notes, mortgages, or other papers relating to or connected with any loan, account, settlement of any account or any part thereof, or other transaction, between the United States or any state thereof or any corporation all

                    <p>
                        The purpose of authentication and certification of records is to avoid the inconvenience and sometimes the impossibility of producing original public documents in court, and admission of certified records tends to expedite trial of cases. State v. Watts,
                        <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 445</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 389 (1976).

                    <p>
                        But Authentication Is Essential. - Proper authentication is essential to the admission in evidence of the copies of the original records, and papers purporting to be exemplification from the Treasury Department of the United States, not authenticated,
                        will not be admitted. Mott v. Ramsay, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 152</cite> (1885).

                        In order for this section to apply it must affirmatively appear that the evidence was offered as a properly authenticated copy of a public record in accordance with this section. State v. Bovender, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 683</cite>,
                        65 S.E.2d 323 (1951), overruled on other grounds, State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 539</cite>, 380 S.E.2d 118 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Parol Evidence Inadmissible. - The contents of the original record may not be proved by parol evidence under this section, but must be shown by a certified copy. National Sur. Co. v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 507</cite>,
                        97 S.E. 417 (1918).

                    <p>
                        Reading of Record by District Attorney. - There is no error in allowing a properly certified copy of a record to be read into evidence by the district attorney, as opposed to having the document passed among the jurors. State v. Miller,

                    <p>
                        This section does not impose the restriction upon the general rule that for a stamped, printed or typewritten signature to be a good signature, the signature must be made under the hand of the person making it. State v. Watts,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">289 N.C. 445</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 389 (1976).

                        Same - Presumption. - When the authorized officer of the D.M.V. provides records of the Division pursuant to statute, it may be presumed that he intends to authenticate the documents and to adopt the mechanical reproduction of his name as his own signature.

                    In all actions for the possession of or title to any real estate parol testimony may be introduced to identify the land sued for, and fit it to the description contained in the paper-writing offered as evidence of title or of the right of possession,
                    and if from this evidence the jury is satisfied that the land in question is the identical land intended to be conveyed by the parties to such paper-writing, then such paper-writing shall be deemed and taken to be sufficient in law
                    to pass such title to or interest in such land as it purports to pass: Provided, that such paper-writing is in all other respects sufficient to pass such title or interest.

                        Section Not Retroactive in Operation. - There is a general presumption against the retroactive operation of a statute where it would impair vested rights; therefore, this section cannot be held to operate retrospectively so as to allow parol testimony
                        to locate land referred to and ambiguously described in a contract made before the passage of this section. Lowe v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 472</cite>, 17 S.E. 539 (1893).

                    <p>
                        Deed Must Contain Some Description. - This section applies only where there is a description which can be aided by parol, but not when there is no description. Lowe v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 472</cite>, 17 S.E.
                        539 (1893); Hemphill v. Annis, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 514</cite>, 26 S.E. 152 (1896); Harris v. Woodward, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 580</cite>, 41 S.E. 790 (1902).

                    <p>
                        A deed which fails to describe any land is as void now as it was before the passage of this section, but a description by name, where lands have a known name, is sufficient. Moore v. Fowle, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. 51</cite>,
                        51 S.E. 796 (1905).

                    <p>
                        And Description Must Identify Land or Refer to Source of Identification. - The statute applies only when there is a description which can be aided by parol, and cannot be held to validate a deed where the description is too vague and indefinite to identify
                        the land claimed and to fit it to the description. At all events, the description as it may be explained by oral testimony must identify and make certain the land intended to be conveyed. Failing in this, the deed is void. Holloman
                        v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 386</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 143 (1953).

                    <p>
                        The statutory rule permitting the use of parol testimony to fit the description in the deed to the land intended to be conveyed does not relieve the invalidity due to vagueness, indefiniteness and uncertainty unless there are elements of description which
                        are either certain in themselves or are capable of being reduced to certainty by reference to something extrinsic, to which the deed refers. The liberal rule of construction does not permit the passing of title to land by parol.
                        Such evidence cannot be used to enlarge the scope of the descriptive words. The deed itself must point to the source from which evidence aliunde to make the description complete is to be sought. Holloman v. Davis,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">238 N.C. 386</cite>, 78 S.E.2d 143 (1953).

                    <p>
                        The description must identify the land, or it must refer to something that will identify it with certainty. Cummings v. Dosam, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 28</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 513 (1968).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A deed purporting to convey an interest in land is void unless it contains a description of the land sufficient to identify it or refers to something extrinsic by which the land may be identified with certainty. Overton v. Boyce,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">289 N.C. 291</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 347 (1976).

                        Parol Evidence Alone Cannot Establish Boundary. - While parol evidence is competent to "fit the description to the thing," it is not competent to establish a line or corner when the instrument by its terms wholly fails to identify such line or corner;
                        in other words, it is competent to find but not to make a corner. Holmes v. Sapphire Valley Co., <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 410</cite>, 28 S.E. 545 (1897).

                        Description in Deed Must Be Fitted to Earth's Surface. - In an action to recover for the wrongful cutting and removal of timber from land claimed by plaintiffs, plaintiffs must locate the land by fitting the description in their deeds to the earth's surface,
                        regardless of whether they rely upon their deeds as proof of title or color of title, or, in the absence of title or color of title, they are required to establish the known and visible lines and boundaries of the land actually
                        occupied by them for the statutory period. Andrews v. Bruton, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 93</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 786 (1955).

                    <p>
                        Those having the burden of proof must locate the land they claim title to by fitting the description contained in the paper-writing offered as evidence of title to the land's surface. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 175</cite>,
                        166 S.E.2d 70 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Allegations as to title having been denied, it was incumbent upon plaintiffs in ejectment action to establish both ownership and trespass. Whether relying upon their deeds as proof of title or of color of title, they were required to locate the land by
                        fitting the description in the deeds to the earth's surface and showing that such deeds embraced the land in controversy. In the absence of title or color of title, they were required to establish the known and visible lines and
                        boundaries of the land actually occupied for the statutory period. Midgett v. Midgett, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 74, 168 S.E.2d 53 (1969).

                        Scope of Descriptive Words in Deed May Not Be Enlarged by Parol Evidence. - Parol evidence is admissible to fit the description in a deed showing color of title to the land. Such evidence cannot, however, be used to enlarge the scope of the descriptive
                        words. McDaris v. Breit Bar "T" Corp., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 298</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 59 (1965).

                    <p>
                        As the purpose of parol evidence is to fit the description to the property, not to create a description. McDaris v. Breit Bar "T" Corp., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 298</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 59 (1965); Cummings v. Dosam, Inc.,
                        <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 28</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 513 (1968); Builders Supplies Co. v. Gainey, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 261</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 449 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Evidence dehors the deed is admissible to "fit the description to the thing" only when it tends to explain, locate, or make certain some call or descriptive term used in the deed. It is the deed that must speak. The oral evidence must only interpret what
                        has been said therein. McDaris v. Breit Bar "T" Corp., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 298</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 59 (1965).

                        Parol evidence is admissible to fit the description to the land. Such evidence cannot, however, be used to enlarge the scope of the descriptive words. The deed itself must point to the source from which evidence aliunde to make the description complete
                        is to be sought. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 45</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 553 (1971); Builders Supplies Co. v. Gainey, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 261</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 449 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Parol evidence is not admissible to enlarge the scope of the description in the deed, but when the deed itself, including the references to extrinsic things, describes with certainty the property intended to be conveyed, parol evidence is admissible to
                        fit the description in the deed to the land. Overton v. Boyce, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 291</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 347 (1976).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Ambiguous or Indefinite Terms Generally. - Where the written terms contained in the contract are sufficient to pass the property, but are ambiguous or indefinite, then parol evidence of the expressions of the parties and attendant facts and circumstances
                        may be heard to aid in ascertaining the correct meaning of the terms used, but not to alter or add to what has been written. Ward v. Gay, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 397</cite>, 49 S.E. 884 (1905).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Patently Ambiguous Description. - When it is apparent upon the face of the deed, itself, that there is uncertainty as to the land intended to be conveyed and the deed, itself, refers to nothing extrinsic by which such uncertainty can be resolved, the
                        description is said to be patently ambiguous. Overton v. Boyce, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 291</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 347 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A patent ambiguity in the description of the land is such an uncertainty appearing on the face of the instrument that the court, reading the language in the light of all the facts and circumstances referred to in the instrument, is unable to derive therefrom
                        the intention of the parties as to what land was to be conveyed. Overton v. Boyce, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 291</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 347 (1976).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        A patent ambiguity in the description of the land cannot be removed by parol evidence. Cummings v. Dosam, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 28</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 513 (1968).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Parol evidence may not be introduced to remove a patent ambiguity in the description of the land since to do so would not be a use of such evidence to fit the description to the land but a use of such evidence to create a description by adding to the
                        words of the instrument. Overton v. Boyce, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 291</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 347 (1976).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        And Deed Containing Such Description Is Void. - Where the description of land in a deed under which plaintiffs claimed was patently ambiguous, the deed was void and could not be the basis for a valid claim of title in the plaintiffs to the land claimed
                        by them. Overton v. Boyce, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 291</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 347 (1976).

                    <p>
                        The identity or location of the land may be shown by documentary evidence, such as plats, surveys, and field notes. A map made by a surveyor of the premises sued for and of other tracts adjacent thereto, when proved to be correct, is admissible to illustrate
                        other testimony in the case and throw light on the location of the land in controversy; and a draft of a survey, proved to be correct, is admissible in evidence as explanatory of what the surveyor testified he had done in making
                        the survey. Midgett v. Midgett, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 74, 168 S.E.2d 53 (1969).

                        When Description Is Sufficient. - A description of land in a deed as all that tract of land in two certain counties lying on "both sides of old road between" designated points, and bounded by lands of named owners "and others," being parts of certain
                        State grants, conveyed by the patentee or enterer to certain grantees, etc., was sufficient to admit parol evidence in aid of the identification of the lands as those intended to be conveyed. Buckhorn Land &amp; Timber Co. v. Yarbrough,
                        <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. 335</cite>, 102 S.E. 630 (1920).

                    <p>
                        Superior court erred, inter alia, in denying a loan assignee's motion for summary judgment in its quiet title action because the deed of trust adequately described the property to create a lien on that property without the need for reformation and also
                        identified the real estate securing the loan by its correct street address and tax parcel number, and the owner could, and did, encumber the property when he obtained the loan from the assignee's predecessor where several deeds
                        in the owner's chain of title, including the deed conveying the property to him, all included the same legal description as the deed of trust, with no reference to the book and page number of the subdivision's map in the county's
                        Map Book. MTGLQ Inv'rs, L.P. v. Curnin, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 823 S.E.2d 409 (2018).

                    In all actions by or against common carriers or in the trial of any criminal action in which it shall be thought necessary to introduce in evidence any bills of lading issued by said common carrier or by a connecting carrier, it shall be competent to
                    introduce in evidence any paper-writing purporting to be the original bill of lading, or a duplicate thereof, upon proof that such paper purporting to be such bill of lading or duplicate was received in due course of mail from consignor
                    or agent of said carrier or connecting carrier, or delivered by said common carrier to the consignee or other person entitled to the possession of the property for which said paper purports to be the bill of lading: Provided, that
                    such purported bill of lading shall not be declared to be the bill of lading unless the said purported bill of lading is first exhibited by the plaintiff or his agent or attorney to the defendant or its attorney, or its agent upon
                    whom process may be served, ten days before the trial where the point of shipment is in the State, and twenty days when the point of shipment is without the State. Upon such proof and introduction of the bill of lading, the due execution

                    When any person shall bring an action upon a contract, or shall plead, or give notice of, a setoff or counterclaim for goods, wares and merchandise by him sold and delivered, or for work done and performed, he shall file his account with his complaint,
                    or with his plea or notice of setoff or counterclaim, and if upon the trial of the issue, or executing a writ of inquiry of damages in such action, he shall declare upon his oath that the matter in dispute is a book account, and that
                    he hath no means to prove the delivery of any of the articles which he then shall propose to prove by himself but by this book, in that case such book may be given in evidence, if he shall make out by his own oath that it doth contain
                    a true account of all the dealings, or the last settlement of accounts between himself and the opposing party, and that all the articles therein contained, and by him so proved, were bona fide delivered, and that he hath given the
                    opposing party all just credits; and such book and oath shall be received as evidence for the several articles so proved to be delivered within two years next before the commencement of the action, but not for any article of a longer
                    standing, nor for any greater amount than sixty dollars ($60.00).

                        Terms Construed. - In an early case, the words "to make out on his oath" and "to prove," used in the former statute, were construed to be synonymous terms. Kitchen v. Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. 314</cite> (1819).

                        Construction with Former G.S. 8-51. - Notwithstanding the restrictions contained in former G.S. 8-51, in relation to a person's testifying as to any matter between himself and a deceased person, when his executor or administrator is a party, he may, as
                        heretofore, be permitted to testify under this section. Leggett v. Glover, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 211</cite> (1874). See Nall v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 717</cite>, 86 S.E. 627 (1915).

                        Applicability of Section. - This section is applicable only to actions brought under the "book-debt law," hence in an action on a contract for sawing timber, it was not necessary to set out the items in the pleadings. McPhail Bros. v. Johnson,
                        <cite

                    <p>
                        Where Original Account Exceeds Sixty Dollars. - Under this section, a plaintiff may prove by his own oath a balance of sixty dollars, due to him, although his account produced appears to have been originally for more than sixty dollars ($60.00), but is
                        reduced by credits below that amount. McWilliams v. Cosby, <cite class="nc_code">26 N.C. 110</cite> (1843).

                    <p>
                        Same - Dismissal of Part for Jurisdictional Purposes. - Where divers dealings were included in an account, the aggregate of which exceeded sixty dollars ($60.00), the plaintiff could omit or give credit for any item he chose, so as to bring the case within
                        the jurisdiction of a single magistrate. But after thus obtaining jurisdiction the plaintiff could not prove the account under this section for he was required to swear that the account rendered contained a true account of all
                        the dealings. Joseph Waldo &amp; Co. v. Jolly, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 173</cite> (1856).

                    <p>
                        Book and Oath Not Exclusive Evidence. - The book and the oath under this section are not evidence that the book contains all the credits and a full and true account of all the dealings between the parties, so as to show that nothing is due to the other
                        party. Alexander v. Smoot, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. 461</cite> (1852).

                        other witness swearing to the account, the party so swearing being considered as a witness in his own cause. Colbert v. Piercy, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. 77</cite> (1842).

                        Books of Decedent Admissible. - Under this section it is admissible to the amount of sixty dollars ($60.00) to offer the book accounts of a decedent, containing charges against third persons, and made by him. Bland v. Warren,

                    to prove by said book, and that he believes the same to be just, and doth not know of any other or further credit to be given than what is therein mentioned: Provided, that if two years shall not have elapsed previous to the death
                    of the deceased, the executor or administrator may prove the said book account, if the suit shall be commenced within three years from the delivery of the articles: Provided further, that whenever by the aforesaid proviso the time
                    of proving a book account in manner aforesaid is enlarged as to the one party, to the same extent shall be enlarged the time as to the other party.

                        Admissibility of Hospital Records. - A hospital record is a business record, and is admissible into evidence upon the laying of a proper foundation. A proper foundation consists of testimony from a hospital librarian or custodian of the records or other
                        qualified witness as to the identity and authenticity of the record and the mode of its preparation, including testimony that the entries were made at or near the time of the act or event recorded, that the entries were made by
                        persons having personal knowledge of the event or act, and that the entries were made ante litem motam. The court, however, should exclude from jury consideration entries which amount to hearsay on hearsay. Donavant v. Hudspeth,
                        <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 321, 330 S.E.2d 517, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 1</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 797 (1986); In re Parker, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite>                        423, 368 S.E.2d 879 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Authenticating Hospital Records. - This section merely eliminated the necessity of taking original hospital records to court, where they were often kept for long periods to the dismay of record keepers and the inconvenience of those who needed to use
                        the records for any purpose, including the later treatment of the patient. It did not modify the then-existing process of authenticating hospital records but, to the contrary, it ratified and reinforced the process by continuing
                        to require authenticating testimony. In re Will of Cromartie, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 306 S.E.2d 853 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The key to authenticating hospital records is not personal knowledge by anyone of particular entries or occurrences, but evidence of system and practice; evidence that a business-like system of compiling records exists, which requires that entries be
                        made at or near the time involved by those who examine, observe, test and treat patients; and that in practice the system is generally followed. When that is testified to by someone familiar with the system, and the purported record
                        involved is testified to be genuine, the authenticating process is complete. In re Will of Cromartie, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 306 S.E.2d 853 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a matter of common knowledge among those familiar with hospital records that entries requiring dictation and transcription are done late by many doctors because they give priority to their other medical duties. Nevertheless, such entries, when regularly
                        made, are still parts of the patients' record and should be so considered, except when there is evidence of duplicity or bad faith. In re Will of Cromartie, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 115,
                        306 S.E.2d 853 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Mental Health Records Previously Admitted Into Evidence. - Trial court did not err by considering mental health records of a mother contained within the underlying file and previously admitted into evidence in proceedings to terminate her parental rights,
                        because the mental health records challenged by the mother were originally admitted into evidence during a permanency planning review hearing and were not challenged by the mother at that time. In re J.B.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 616 S.E.2d 264 (2005).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not required that the authenticating proof be only by personal knowledge. Such a requirement would, for all intents and purposes, abrogate the use of business records in court; because under the conditions that most businesses and hospitals are
                        conducted today, it is a rare person indeed, that has personal knowledge of any work or undertaking done by others. In re Will of Cromartie, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 306 S.E.2d 853

                        Use Not Limited to Absence of Witness. - Nothing in this section or case law limits the use of a verified statement of the account to only those situations where the witness is unavailable to testify. Johnson Serv. Co. v. Richard J. Curry &amp; Co.,

                        Verification Essential. - An itemized account to be prima facie evidence of its correctness must be properly verified and stated so as to show an indebtedness. Knight v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 84</cite>, 42 S.E.

                    <p>
                        Sufficiency of Verification. - Verification of the itemized account is sufficient if the affiant has personal knowledge of the account or is familiar with the books and records of the business and is in a position to testify as to the correctness of the
                        records. Johnson Serv. Co. v. Richard J. Curry &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 223 S.E.2d 565 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Where the verifier has no personal knowledge of all the matters contained therein will not disqualify the exhibit as a verified statement if such verifier certifies familiarity with the books and records of the business and is competent to testify to
                        their correctness. The law requires no more. VanLandingham v. Northeastern Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 778, 306 S.E.2d 169, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 826</cite>,

                        In an action for accounting and tax services rendered, the different itemized bills for each period showing the services rendered, the time required, expenses incurred, charges made, the previous balance, the amount then due, and the different ledger
                        sheets showing charges, payments, and balances all along, are ingredients enough for a good, verified statement of account. VanLandingham v. Northeastern Motors, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite>                        778, 306 S.E.2d 169, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 826</cite>, 310 S.E.2d 359 (1983).

                        Unverified Statements of Account Admissible as Business Records. - In an action to recover for labor and materials supplied by plaintiff in repairing defendant's truck, plaintiff's exhibit which consisted of itemized statements of account for materials
                        supplied and labor performed by plaintiff upon defendant's truck was not admissible pursuant to this section because it was not verified; however, the exhibit was admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule
                        where there was testimony that the exhibit properly reflected the work done by plaintiff's shop foreman and charges made pursuant to the work he performed. Bond Park Truck Serv. v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite>                        443, 281 S.E.2d 61 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Where it affirmatively appears from the record that the various entries on the papers comprising the exhibit admitted as a verified statement of account were made in the regular course of business, at or near the time of the transactions involved, and
                        were authenticated by a witness familiar with the system under which they were made, the exhibit was admissible under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. VanLandingham v. Northeastern Motors, Inc.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 778, 306 S.E.2d 169, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">309 N.C. 826</cite>, 310 S.E.2d 359 (1983).

                    <p>
                        Statements showing amounts due for services rendered, attached to complaint, and based upon an unverified computer printout were not admissible as verified itemized statements under this section. However, as this evidence was admissible under the business
                        records exception to the hearsay rule, and as the jury was correctly instructed on the law pertaining to an account stated by an implied agreement, this error was rendered harmless. Santora, McKay &amp; Ranieri v. Franklin,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 339 S.E.2d 799 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Competency of Witness Required. - Under the terms of this section, as now drawn, an affiant, verifying an account so as to make the same prima facie evidence, must be a competent witness to the facts, and, when it appears on the face of the account that
                        he has no personal knowledge of these facts, or it is established that he is otherwise an incompetent witness, the ex parte account so verified should not be received in evidence. Nall v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 717</cite>,
                        86 S.E. 627 (1915). And it must appear that he is not excluded under former G.S. 8-51. See William M. Lloyd &amp; Co. v. Poythress, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 180</cite>, 116 S.E. 584 (1923).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An itemized, verified statement of an account is an ex parte statement and this section, governing its admission, must be strictly complied with, and the person who verifies the account, being treated as a witness pro tanto, must be competent to testify
                        as a witness in respect to the account if called upon at the trial; but where an itemized statement of account offered at the trial was verified by the treasurer of the plaintiff corporation who declared in his affidavit that "he
                        is familiar with the books and business" of the plaintiff, it could not be held as a matter of law that the affiant had no personal knowledge of the transaction, and the exclusion of the statement by the trial court was reversible
                        error. Nall v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 717</cite>, 86 S.E. 627 (1915), cited and distinguished, in Endicott-Johnson Corp. v. Schochet, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 769</cite>, 153 S.E. 403

                    <p>
                        The account must be sworn to by some person who would be a competent witness to testify to the correctness of the account. Johnson Serv. Co. v. Richard J. Curry &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 166, 223 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        An affiant who verifies an account of goods sold and delivered, which is to be received into evidence and taken as prima facie evidence of its correctness pursuant to this section, shall be regarded and dealt with as a witness pro tanto, and to such extent
                        must meet the requirements and is subject to the qualifications and restrictions as other witnesses. Bramco Elec. Corp. v. Shell, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 230 S.E.2d 576 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Where plaintiff's purported itemized statement was verified by a woman who was identified in the verification as the president of plaintiff corporation, but the verification contained no statement to the effect, and there was no other showing, that affiant
                        had any personal knowledge of the matters set forth in the affidavit or that she was familiar with the books and records of plaintiff corporation, and the burden was on plaintiff to establish a prima facie case, it failed to show
                        that the affiant would have been competent to testify if called as a witness at trial. Bramco Elec. Corp. v. Shell, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 717, 230 S.E.2d 576 (1976).

                        Prima Facie Case. - In an action to recover for goods sold and delivered, where a verified statement of the account shows that it is for goods sold by the plaintiff to the defendant and sets out the number and kind of articles, the catalogue numbers,
                        price per dozen and discounts allowed, and there are trade terms and abbreviations well understood in the trade, which show more fully the kind of articles, it is properly itemized to make out a prima facie case under this section.
                        Claus v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 552</cite>, 53 S.E. 433 (1906); Lipinsky v. Revell, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 508</cite>, 83 S.E. 820 (1914).

                    <p>
                        To make out a prima facie case under this section, the account not only must be properly verified and itemized, it must also be stated so as to show an indebtedness. Kight v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 200,
                        234 S.E.2d 637 (1977); Santora, McKay &amp; Ranieri v. Franklin, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 585, 339 S.E.2d 799 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Nonsuit. - Where a verified account or affidavit to a statement for goods sold and delivered is insufficient to establish a prima facie case under the provision of this section, and this is the only evidence offered, a judgment of nonsuit upon the evidence
                        is properly allowed. Nall v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 717</cite>, 86 S.E. 627 (1915).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Burden of Proof. - Where a prima facie case had been made out by the plaintiff in his action to recover the purchase price of goods sold and delivered to the defendant, and the latter contended that he, as the agent for the former, was to sell upon commission,
                        and that he had accounted for such sales, except a small balance which he tendered, or offered to submit to judgment for that amount, the burden was upon defendant to show the fact of agency, and of accounting thereon, which was
                        for the determination of the jury upon the question of indebtedness. Carr v. Alexander &amp; Garsed, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 665</cite>, 86 S.E. 613 (1915).

                        Husband as Agent of Wife. - Itemized statement of goods held insufficient to establish agency of husband in purchasing goods for use on wife's farm. Pitt v. Speight, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 585</cite>, 24 S.E.2d 350 (1943).

                        Subordination of Section to Former G.S. 8-51. - In William M. Lloyd &amp; Co. v. Poythress, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 180</cite>, 116 S.E. 584 (1923), the court said: "We have held that this section, appearing as a section
                        on the law of evidence, should be construed in subordination to C.S., 1795, [former G.S. 8-51] under the principle announced in Cecil v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 431</cite>, 81 S.E. 616 (1914)." See Nall

                        Tables Need Not Be Specially Put in Evidence. - This section being a public act, the tables herein contained are competent as evidence without being specially put in evidence. Coley v. City of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 301</cite>,
                        28 S.E. 482 (1897).

                    <p>
                        The mortuary table in this section is one of the prevailing mortality tables put into statutory form so as to permit its use without formal proof. Rea v. Simowitz, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 575</cite>, 35 S.E.2d 871, 162 A.L.R.
                        999 (1945).

                    <p>
                        The mortuary table is statutory and need not be introduced in evidence, but may receive judicial notice when facts are in evidence requiring or permitting its application. Chandler v. Moreland Chem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 395</cite>,
                        154 S.E.2d 502 (1967); Thomas v. Dixson, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 363 S.E.2d 209 (1988).

                    <p>
                        The table, being statutory, need not be introduced in evidence in order to make use of it upon the question of damages when other facts are in evidence permitting its application. Johnson v. Lamb, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 701</cite>,
                        161 S.E.2d 131 (1968).

                    <p>
                        Mortuary table is competent evidence bearing upon life expectancy and future earning capacity of the injured person in actions for personal injuries resulting in permanent disability. Gillikin v. Burbage, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 317</cite>,
                        139 S.E.2d 753 (1965).

                    <p>
                        But it is not admissible unless there is evidence of permanent injury. Gillikin v. Burbage, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 317</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 753 (1965); McCoy v. Dowdy, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 192 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Where testimony tended to show that plaintiff's injuries were permanent, etc. in character, it was proper for the presiding judge to permit plaintiff to introduce and the jury to consider the mortuary tables formerly embodied in this section. Hunt v.
                        Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 42</cite>, 76 S.E.2d 326 (1953).

                    <p>
                        The mortuary tables were properly introduced into evidence on the issue of damages over defendant's objection where plaintiff introduced evidence that he received permanently disfiguring scars from sulphuric acid burns as a result of defendant's negligence.
                        Chandler v. Moreland Chem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 395</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 502 (1967).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Before evidence of life expectancy under this section can be introduced, there must be evidence to a reasonable certainty of permanent injury. Mitchem v. Sims, <cite class="nc_code">55 N.C. App.</cite> 459, 285 S.E.2d 839 (1982).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where sufficient evidence existed to establish that slip and fall plaintiff suffered permanent injuries, the introduction of a mortuary table was not error. Matthews v. Food Lion, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite>                        784, 522 S.E.2d 587 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Tables Not Conclusive. - In an action to recover damages for a personal injury, the expectation of life tables contained in this section are not conclusive but are merely evidential on the issue as to damages. Sledge v. Lumber Co.,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">140 N.C. 459</cite>, 53 S.E. 295 (1906); Odom v. Canfield Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 134</cite>, 91 S.E. 716 (1917); Young v. E.A. Wood &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 435</cite>, 146 S.E. 70 (1929).

                    <p>
                        And Must Be Considered with Other Evidence. - The tables must be considered in connection with the "other evidence as to the health, constitution and habits" of the deceased. Russell v. Windsor Steamboat Co., <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 961</cite>,
                        36 S.E. 191 (1900). See Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Atlantic Greyhound Lines, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 293</cite>, 186 S.E. 320 (1936); Hancock v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 129</cite>, 189 S.E. 631 (1937).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The mortuary table is merely evidence of life expectancy to be considered with other evidence as to the health, constitution and habits of the deceased, and an instruction making the expectancy set out in this section definitive and conclusive not only
                        violated the evidence rule, but also G.S. 1-180 (now repealed) prohibiting the expression of an opinion "whether a fact is fully or sufficiently proven." Starnes v. Tyson, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 395</cite>,
                        38 S.E.2d 211 (1946).

                    <p>
                        Bankruptcy court's valuation of the debtor's life estate was consistent with North Carolina law; while the bankruptcy court clearly recognized that G.S. 8-46 allowed such number to be adjusted based on other evidence, the bankruptcy court's finding that
                        appellant's evidence was either insufficient or not credible was entitled to deference. Mitchell v. Parker (In re Parker), - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C. Aug. 2, 2011).

                    <p>
                        Value of Life Tenancy. - When a life tenant and the remainderman sell the lands, the life tenant is entitled to the present cash value of her life estate in the purchase price, computed according to her life expectancy at the date of the execution of
                        the deed, and the remainderman is entitled to the balance of the purchase price. Thompson v. Avery County, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 405</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 146 (1939).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Value of Dower. - Because the mortuary table is only evidentiary, the cash value of dower inchoate depended on the ages of husband and wife, and on their health, habits and all other circumstances tending to show the probabilities as to the length of
                        life; there is no reason for differing rules for determining life expectancy as between married women entitled to dower inchoate and widows entitled to dower consummate. Waggoner v. Waggoner, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 210</cite>,
                        97 S.E.2d 887 (1957). As to abolition of dower, see <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.029.html#t29a01s29-4" target="_blank">G.S. 29-4</a></cite>.

                    <p>
                        Failure to Instruct Jury as to Life Expectancy of Plaintiff. - In the absence of a request, the judge did not commit reversible error in failing to instruct the jury in an action for personal injury that the plaintiff had a life expectancy of 15.27 years
                        according to the mortuary table, which he had introduced in evidence, where, although the charge did not contain a direct reference to the plaintiff's life expectancy, the court did instruct the jury to take into consideration
                        all the evidence bearing on the issue, including the plaintiff's age. Derby v. Owens, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. 591</cite>, 96 S.E.2d 851 (1957).

                    <p>
                        Erroneous Instruction. - Where the element of future damages figured largely in consideration of the issue, an instruction to the effect that the jury could take into consideration the mortuary tables as to the life expectancy of plaintiff, without reference
                        to the evidence as to plaintiff's health prior and subsequent to the accident and without charging that the mortuary tables could be considered only as evidence together with other evidence as to the health, constitution and habits
                        of plaintiff, was incomplete and erroneous. Harris v. Atlantic Greyhound Corp., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 346</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 710 (1956).

                <p>
                    Whenever it is necessary to establish the present worth or cash value of an annuity to a person, payable annually during the person's life, such present worth or cash value may be ascertained by the use of the following table in connection with the mortality
                    tables established by law, the first column representing the number of years the annuity is to run and the second column representing the present cash value of an annuity of one dollar for such number of years, respectively:

                    The present cash value of the annuity for a fraction of a year may be ascertained as follows: Multiply the difference between the cash value of the annuities for the preceding and succeeding full years by the fraction of the year in decimals and add the
                    sum to the present cash value for the preceding full year. When a person is entitled to the use of a sum of money for life, or for a given time, the interest thereon for one year, computed at four and one half percent (4 1/2%), may
                    be considered as an annuity and the present cash value be ascertained as herein provided: Provided, the interest rate in computing the present cash value of a life interest in land shall be six percent (6%).

                    Whenever the mortality tables set out in G.S. 8-46 are admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding to establish the expectancy of continued life of any person from any period of the person's life, whether the person is living at the time or not,
                    the annuity tables herein set forth shall be evidence, but not conclusive, of the loss of income during the period of life expectancy of the person.

        Valuation of Life Estate.
       </b> - Bankruptcy court's valuation of the debtor's life estate was consistent with G.S. 8-47; the bankruptcy court calculated the present cash value of the life estate by multiplying the $130,010 sale price for the property
                        by 6%, resulting in the annual value of $7,800.60 for the life estate, which amount was multiplied by $13.765, resulting in a value of the life estate of $107,375.25. Mitchell v. Parker (In re Parker), - F. Supp. 2d - (W.D.N.C.

                    <p>
                        This section abolishes the common-law rule which prevented a party who was interested in the result of the verdict and judgment from appearing as a witness. A similar enactment will be found in the statutes of practically all the states. The trend of
                        the development of the rules of evidence has been to remove personal disqualification to testify. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 386</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 37 (1948).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section Construed with Former Dead Man's Statute. - The provisions of this section must be considered in the light of those contained in former G.S. 8-51 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,
                        Rule 601(c)) which place certain restrictions on the general rule embodied in this section. In other words, the provisions of former G.S. 8-51 formed exceptions to this section, and took them from the operation of its principle,
                        leaving the parties falling within these exceptions to stand upon the same footing as they did prior to the enactment of this section. See Charlotte Oil &amp; Fertilizer Co. v. Rippy, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 643</cite>,
                        32 S.E. 980 (1899).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And with G.S. 8-50 and G.S. 8-56. - The construction of this section should also be in connection with the provisions of G.S. 8-50 and 8-56, since they all relate to the same subject, i.e., the competency of the witnesses. Powell v. Strickland,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">163 N.C. 393</cite>, 79 S.E. 872 (1913).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Burden on Challenger to Show Disqualification. - The general rule established by this section and G.S. 8-50 is that no person offered as a witness shall be excluded on account of interest or because a party to the action, except as otherwise provided.
                        Hence, it is incumbent upon one who challenges the competency of the witness to show disqualification. Sanderson v. Paul, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 56</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 156 (1952).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Party Testifying in Own Behalf. - The provisions of this section make it permissible for a party to testify in his own behalf. State v. McIntosh, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 607</cite> (1870); Autry v. Floyd, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 186</cite>,
                        37 S.E. 208 (1900).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Legatee Under Will as Witness. - Under this section, removing the disqualification on account of interest, the widow of the testator, who was named as a legatee and devisee in a will, was a competent witness to prove the fact that the script propounded
                        was found among the papers of the deceased. Nor would the last provision of the section prevent the widow from testifying, since this provision applies only to attesting witnesses to the execution of a will. Cornelius v. Brawley,
                        <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 542</cite>, 14 S.E. 78 (1891).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beneficiary Under Holographic Will. - Under this section and G.S. 8-50, one who is a beneficiary under a holographic will may testify to such competent relevant and material facts as tend to establish it as a valid will without rendering void the benefits
                        he is to receive thereunder. It is otherwise as to an attesting witness of a will that the statute requires to be attested by witness thereto. In re Will of Westfeldt, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 702</cite>,
                        125 S.E. 531 (1924).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Executor as Witness. - An executor, named in a will, was a competent witness to testify as to the existence, probate and registration of a will, he being rendered competent by this section, and he was not disqualified by former G.S. 8-51 (see now
                        <cite
                            class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rule 601(c)), as to transactions occurring after the death of the testator, as they could in no sense be considered as transactions between the
                            witness and the testator. Cox v. Beaufort County Lumber Co., <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 78</cite>, 32 S.E. 381 (1899).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The widow of a deceased vendor, who was present at the sale of a mule by her husband to the plaintiff, was a competent witness under this section, and was not excluded under former G.S. 8-51 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,
                        Rule 601(c)), as she was not a party to the action and had no interest in the same. Little v. Ratliff, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 262</cite>, 35 S.E. 469 (1900).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mortgagee. - Where he is not excluded under the provisions of former G.S. 8-51 (see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rule 601(c)), the mortgagee in a chattel
                        mortgage is competent, as a subscribing witness thereto, to prove its execution for admission to probate, inasmuch as this section removes the disqualification formerly attaching to witnesses having an interest. Clark v. Hodge,
                        <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 761</cite>, 21 S.E. 562 (1895).

                        Fornication and Adultery. - In a trial for fornication and adultery a former defendant as to whom a nolle prosequi had been entered was a competent witness against the other defendant. State v. Phipps, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 203</cite>                        (1877).

                        (1892).

                    <p>
                        Consolidation and Testimony of Codefendant. - Where the testimony of codefendant would have carried equal force if it had been received without an order of consolidation, there was no abuse of discretion in the trial judge's order consolidating cases
                        for trial. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 223</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 359 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Defendant's contention that consolidation of cases resulted in prejudicial error to him because he was deprived of his right to open and close the jury arguments when his codefendant elected to testify was without merit. State v. Taylor,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">289 N.C. 223</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 359 (1976).

                    <p>
                        Testimony of an Accomplice. - An accomplice could not testify on direct examination to facts tending to incriminate defendant and at the same time refuse to answer questions on cross-examination relating to matters embraced in his examination-in-chief,
                        and where he refused to answer relevant questions on cross-examination on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him, it was error for the court to refuse defendant's motion that his testimony-in-chief be stricken
                        from the record, the refusal to answer the questions on cross-examination rendering the testimony-in-chief incompetent. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 796</cite>, 188 S.E. 639 (1936).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is well established that an accomplice is always a competent witness. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 223</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 359 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fact that accomplice's testimony is usually induced by promise of or hope for leniency goes only to his credibility as a witness, and not to his competency as a witness. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 223</cite>,
                        221 S.E.2d 359 (1976).

                        Instructing Witness Not to Incriminate Himself. - In an indictment for an affray, it was not error for the presiding judge to caution the witness (a defendant) before the counsel for the other defendant cross-examined him, that he need not tell anything
                        to incriminate himself. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. 595</cite> (1885).

                        In the trial of any criminal action or proceeding in any court in which the question of parentage arises, regardless of any presumptions with respect to parentage, the court before whom the matter may be brought, upon motion of the State or the defendant,
                        shall order that the alleged-parent defendant, the known natural parent, and the child submit to any blood tests and comparisons which have been developed and adapted for purposes of establishing or disproving parentage and which
                        are reasonably accessible to the alleged-parent defendant, the known natural parent, and the child. The results of those blood tests and comparisons, including the statistical likelihood of the alleged parent's parentage, if available,

                                comparisons indicate that the alleged-parent defendant cannot be the natural parent of the child, the jury shall be instructed that if they believe that the witness presenting the results testified truthfully as to those
                                results, and if they believe that the tests and comparisons were conducted properly, then it will be their duty to decide that the alleged-parent is not the natural parent; whereupon, the court shall enter the special verdict

                        a duly certified physician or other expert. The court shall require the person requesting the blood or genetic marker tests to pay the costs of the tests. The court may, in its discretion, tax as part of costs the expenses for

                        to the Rules of Civil Procedure. If no objections are filed within the time and manner prescribed, the test results are admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity

         Many of the cases in the following annotations were decided under this section as it stood before the 1975 amendment, which made the results of a blood test, not in conflict with other blood tests, conclusive rather than merely competent evidence that defendant could not be the father of the child, and prior to the 1993 amendment, which provided for the admissibility of a certified report of the results of a paternity blood test or genetic marker test without additional expert testimony, and assigned weight to such evidence according to the probability of parentage.

                        Scope of Section. - This section authorizes blood tests only upon motion made by either the State or the defendant, and the court involved in the matter must order the test. The statute does not authorize the indiscriminate taking of blood, nor does it
                        allow the performance of a blood test by anyone than a trained technician or anywhere other than a medical facility. State v. Mauney, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 26, 415 S.E.2d 208 (1992).

                        This section does not confer standing upon an alleged natural parent to compel a presumed father to submit to a blood test to determine the paternity of a child born during the marriage of the presumed father to the natural mother. Johnson v. Johnson,

                        Former subdivision (b)(1) of this section (see now subsection (b1)) was applicable to civil actions only; the statute which applies to criminal actions is subdivision (a)(1).

                        appropriate. Smith v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 523</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 408 (1986).

                        Results of Tests Are Competent to Rebut Any Presumption of Paternity. - In both criminal and civil actions in which the question of paternity arises, the results of blood-grouping tests must be admitted in evidence when offered by a duly licensed practicing
                        physician or other qualified person, regardless of any presumptions with respect to paternity, and such evidence shall be competent to rebut any presumptions of paternity. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 159</cite>,

                        To permit the marital presumption to be rebutted absent a determination that another man is the father of the child would illegitimate the child in violation of the public policy of this state. Jones v. Patience, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite>                        434, 466 S.E.2d 720 (1996).

                    <p>
                        Including Common-Law Presumption of Legitimacy. - Assuming blood-grouping tests are made and offered in evidence by qualified persons, the results thereof, if they tend to exclude defendant as the father of the child, may be offered in evidence to rebut
                        the common-law presumption of legitimacy. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 159</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 317 (1972).

                    <p>
                        Tests Cannot Prove Paternity. - The value of serological blood tests, when made and interpreted by specifically qualified technicians, using approved testing procedures and reagents of standard strength, is now generally recognized. Such tests, however,
                        can never prove the paternity of any individual, and they cannot always exclude the possibility. Nevertheless, in a significant number of cases, they can disprove it. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>,
                        177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).

                    <p>
                        Tests Conclusive Only in Excluding Putative Father. - The blood-grouping test results are conclusive only in excluding the putative father. The results might show him to have a blood type which the father of the child must have had; but this only indicates
                        that of all the people of that blood type or group, he, as well as anyone else with that blood type or group, could have been the father of the child. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>,
                        177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).

                    <p>
                        The marital presumption ordinarily may be rebutted by evidence of blood grouping tests excluding a putative father as the biological father. Jones v. Patience, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 466 S.E.2d 720 (1996).

                    <p>
                        Inconsistent Results Allowed. - This statute simply provides that when test results are consistent and show the defendant not to be the father of the child, the jury is required to return a special verdict of not guilty. Nothing in this statute prohibits
                        the admission into evidence of inconsistent results. State v. McInnis, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 401 S.E.2d 774, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 274</cite>, 407 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Varying Results of Blood Tests. - Court did not err by admitting the result of blood tests showing the probability of defendant's fathering the child to be 99.54%, even though it varied greatly from the result of blood tests performed by another laboratory
                        showing the probability of paternity to be only 93.75%. State v. McInnis, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 401 S.E.2d 774, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 274</cite>, 407 S.E.2d

                        Effect Where Principle of Res Judicata Bars Issue of Paternity. - Where the defendant in an action to recover arrearages for child support was barred by principles of res judicata from putting paternity in issue as the result of a prior adjudication of
                        paternity in a Nevada divorce action in which the Nevada court had in personam jurisdiction over the defendant, the trial court erred in allowing the defendant's motion for blood-grouping tests. Williams v. Holland,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 249 S.E.2d 821 (1978).

                    <p>
                        Before a court is required to order a blood-grouping test in a civil action, the question of paternity must arise. If a defendant is barred by res judicata or estoppel from raising the issue of paternity, the statutorily imposed obligation of the court
                        to order that the parties submit to blood-grouping tests never arises, and it is error for the court to enter such order. Withrow v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 67, 280 S.E.2d 22 (1981).

                    <p>
                        Default Judgment Barred Right to a Blood Test. - Because a default judgment conclusively established defendant's paternity, defendant having failed to appeal the default judgment or make a timely motion under Rule 59(a)(8) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
                        res judicata barred the granting of defendant's motion for blood testing. Garrison ex rel. Chavis v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 206, 450 S.E.2d 554 (1994).

                    <p>
                        The defendant was not barred from contesting paternity pursuant to this section where the issue had not been litigated and where the defendant never formally acknowledged paternity in the manner prescribed by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.110.html#t110a09s110-132" target="_blank">G.S. 110-132</a></cite>;
                        furthermore, the defendant was not required to present evidence that another man had acknowledged paternity in order for the court to authorize the test. Ambrose v. Ambrose, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 545, 536 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Defendant Has Right to Blood Test. - There can be no doubt that a defendant's right to a blood test to determine parentage is a substantial right and that, upon defendant's motion, the court must order the test when it is possible to do so. State v. Fowler,
                        <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).

                    <p>
                        A defendant is entitled in a proceeding under the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Act to a blood-grouping test pursuant to this section where the issue of paternity is raised and, upon timely motion, is entitled to have the jury pass on the
                        issue of paternity. Brondum v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 226 S.E.2d 193, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 192</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 687 (1976).

                    <p>
                        The 1975 amendment to this section amplified the importance of the right to a blood-grouping test under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.049.html#t49a01s49-7" target="_blank">G.S. 49-7</a></cite>. State v. Morgan,

                        Indigent defendant's right to a free blood-grouping test may be rendered meaningless without counsel to advise him of his right to demand such a test, to explain the test's significance, to ensure that the test is properly administered and to ensure that
                        the results are properly admitted into evidence. Wake County ex rel. Carrington v. Townes, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 649, 281 S.E.2d 765 (1981), modified, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 333</cite>,

                        The only areas in which the results of blood grouping tests should be open to attack are in the method of testing or in the qualifications of the persons performing the tests. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>,

                        Tests May Not Be Accurate Until Infant Six Months Old. - In a few cases it has been found that an infant's blood group cannot be established immediately after birth. However, by the age of six months, an accurate determination can always be had. State
                        v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 385 (1970).

                    <p>
                        When the death of the child makes a blood test impossible the situation is analogous to that which occurs when an eyewitness to events constituting the basis for an indictment dies before the accused has interviewed him or taken his deposition. It would
                        hardly be suggested that to try the defendant after the death of that witness would deprive him of due process and that therefore the prosecution must be dismissed. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 305</cite>,

                        Tests May Be Ordered in Action for Alimony and Child Support Where Husband Denies Paternity. - In plaintiff-wife's action for alimony, alimony pendente lite and child support, defendant-husband was entitled under the section to an order for a blood grouping
                        test where plaintiff alleged and defendant denied that he was the father of a child born to plaintiff during the subsistence of the marriage. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 159</cite>,

                        And Results of Test May Also Be Evidence of Adultery. - While there is no authority for blood-grouping tests unless an issue of paternity is raised, in a case in which the issue of paternity is raised, the results of the blood-grouping tests, if they
                        exclude defendant as the father of a child admittedly born during the subsistence of the marriage, also would be evidence of adultery. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 159</cite>, 188 S.E.2d

                        judge's findings that scientific evidence demonstrated that husband was sterile at the time the child was conceived, and that if husband was sterile, the blood grouping probability of paternity (set at 95.98%) was reduced to 0%,
                        judge's conclusion that husband fathered the child was erroneous. Cole v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 247, 328 S.E.2d 446, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 660</cite>, 335 S.E.2d

                        The trial court properly admitted the presumption of paternity relevant to genetic marker testing set forth in this section although the record contained no ruling as to defendant's written objection to the admission nor any stipulation to admit the evidence,
                        contrary to the court's assertion that the parties did so stipulate; where expert testimony indicated that paternity by defendant was a factual possibility, it would have been error to assign 0 as the prior probability of paternity.

                        Chain of Custody. - It was prejudicial error for the trial court to admit other man's blood test results where the chain of custody was not properly established. Rockingham County Dep't of Social Serv. ex rel. Shaffer v. Shaffer,

                    <p>
                        If a paternity blood test is not ordered by the trial court upon motion by a party, the standard in G.S. 8-50.1(b1) will not apply and the party seeking to admit the test must present independent evidence of the chain of custody. Where no sworn affidavits
                        or witness testimony established that specimen's were drawn from a putative father and the minor child, where no testimony was submitted from the person who collected the samples, and where no testimony or an affidavit was presented
                        from the individual who performed the DNA test to confirm that the specimen was transferred within the laboratory without being disturbed, it was error to admit the results of the test and a determination of parentage was reversed.

                        section; thus, blood tests were erroneously admitted. Rockingham County Dep't of Social Servs. ex rel. Shaffer v. Shaffer, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 197, 484 S.E.2d 415 (1997).

                        Trial court erred in precluding the alleged father from participating in the termination of parental rights hearing after a paternity test indicated that there was a zero possibility that he was the child's father because the presumption created by the

                        paternity of the father in a child custody dispute. Helms v. Landry, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 787, 671 S.E.2d 347 (2009), review denied, stay denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 125</cite>,

                        U.S. Const., Amend. VI Not Violated by Admission of Declaration. - Albeit a dying declaration is indubitably hearsay and the declarant is, of course, not available for cross-examination, the admission of such evidence is not a violation of U.S. Const.,
                        Amend. VI. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        General Assembly Codified Essentials of Former Law. - "Dying declarations" by the person whose death is an issue in the case have long been admissible in North Carolina provided (1) at the time they were made the declarant was in actual danger of death;
                        (2) he had full apprehension of the danger; (3) death did in fact ensue; and (4) declarant, if living, would be a competent witness to testify to the matter. In 1973, the General Assembly codified the essentials of those requirements
                        in this section. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And Case Law Requirements Are Unchanged. - In State v. Bowden, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 702</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 414 (1976), and in State v. Cousin, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 413</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 518 (1976), it was noted,
                        without deciding, that the words "no hope of recovery" in the statute might make the statutory exception to the hearsay rule more restrictive than existing case law. The Supreme Court concluded that the statutory prerequisites
                        that the deceased must have been "conscious of approaching death and believed that there was no hope of recovery" did not change the case-law requirements that in order to be admissible the declarations of a decedent must have
                        been "in present anticipation of death." State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The statutory prerequisites that the deceased must have been "conscious of approaching death and believed that there was no hope of recovery" did not change case-law requirements that in order to be admissible the declaration of a decedent must have been
                        "in present anticipation of death." It was enough if he "believed he was going to die." State v. Penn, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 244 S.E.2d 702 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Rationale Based on Trustworthiness of Declaration. - The rationale of this section clearly rests upon a belief in the general trustworthiness of dying declarations, rather than upon the necessity for bringing to justice the perpetrators of secret homicides.
                        State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 220</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 391 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The common law and statutory requirement of "no hope of recovery" rests upon the tenet that when an individual believes death to be imminent, the ordinary motives for falsehood are absent and most powerful considerations impel him to speak the truth.
                        The solemnity of approaching death is considered by the law as creating an obligation equal to that which is imposed by a positive oath administered in a court of justice. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>,
                        243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The public necessity of preventing secret homicides from going unpunished requires the preservation of dying declarations as evidence, notwithstanding the inability of the defendant to cross-examine his accuser. State v. Stevens,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Section Expands the Admissibility of Statements. - The overall effect of this section was to liberalize the dying declaration exception to the hearsay rule by expanding the admissibility of such statements to all civil and criminal trials. State v. Lester,
                        <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 220</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 391 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Declarant's Death Need Not Be in Issue. - Admissibility seems no longer to be confined to situations in which the declarant's death is in issue, but rather extends to any situation in which the cause or circumstances of the declarant's death may be relevant
                        to any issue in litigation. State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 220</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 391 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is not necessary that the declarant should be in the very act of dying; it is enough if he is under the apprehension of impending dissolution. Stated in simpler terms, it is enough if he believed he was going to die. State v. Stevens,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).

                    <p>
                        And Test Is Not Actual Swiftness with Which Death Ensues. - The fact that the declarant survived one week longer than the doctor had told him he might live did not affect the admissibility of his dying declarations. The test is the declarant's belief
                        in the nearness of death when he made the statement, not the actual swiftness with which death ensued. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        It is not necessary for the declarant to state that he perceives he is going to die. If all the circumstances, including the nature of the wound, indicate that the declarant realized death was near, this requirement of the law is satisfied. State v. Bowden,
                        <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 702</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 414 (1976); State v. Cousin, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 413</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 518 (1976); State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 220</cite>,
                        240 S.E.2d 391 (1978); State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 470</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 799 (1983).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The consciousness of approaching death may be made to appear from what the injured person said; or from the nature and extent of the wounds inflicted, being obviously such that he must have felt or known that he could not survive; as well as from his
                        conduct at the time and the communications, if any, made to him by his medical advisers, if assented to or understandingly acquiesced in by him. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>,
                        243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The party seeking admission of the out-of-court statement need not show that the declarant stated he had given up all hope of living or considered himself to be in the throes of death. All that must be shown is that the declarant believes he is going
                        to die. This belief is best shown by his express communication to this effect. However, it is not necessary that declarant personally express his belief that he has no chance of recovery. This may be shown by the circumstances.
                        State v. Hamlette, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 490</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 338 (1981).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The declaration must have been voluntary and made when the declarant was conscious of approaching death and without hope for recovery. State v. Bowden, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 702</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 414 (1976); State v.
                        Cousin, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 413</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 518 (1976).

                    <p>
                        The admissibility of a declaration as a dying declaration is a question to be determined by the trial judge, and when the judge admits the declaration, his ruling is reviewable only to determine whether there is evidence tending to show facts essential
                        to support it. State v. Bowden, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 702</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 414 (1976); State v. Cousin, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 413</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 518 (1976); State v. Penn, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                        482, 244 S.E.2d 702 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The admissibility of dying declarations is a decision for the trial judge, and review by the Supreme Court is limited to the narrow question of whether there is any evidence tending to show the factual prerequisites to admissibility. State v. Stevens,
                        <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978); State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 470</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 799 (1983).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A dying declaration is not conclusive, its weight and credibility being for the jury to determine. It may be impeached in the same manner as any other sworn statement. State v. Harding, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 223</cite>,
                        230 S.E.2d 397 (1976).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once admitted into evidence, a dying declaration is no different from other testimony. The extent of its credibility is a matter for the jury and it is subject to impeachment or corroboration upon the same grounds and in the same manner as the testimony
                        of a sworn witness. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Declarations Made in Response to Leading Questions. - The fact that the dying declarations were made in response to leading questions did not require their exclusion from evidence. The qualifying questions were not perfunctory to be used in the event
                        the dying man took a turn for the worse, but were clearly appropriate in light of the declarant's severe injuries and inability to speak, and the declarations were as nearly spontaneous as declarations by one under the circumstances
                        could be. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Impeachment of Dying Declaration. - The impeachment of a dying declaration must proceed under the ordinary rules of evidence. Under these rules, for the purpose of impeachment, a party is entitled to introduce evidence only of the general reputation or
                        character of the witness. Therefore, the courts do not permit the witness to be impeached by independent evidence of particular misconduct. Specifically, this means that a witness may not be impeached by record evidence of his
                        conviction of crime. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Evidence of the general character or reputation of a decedent is relevant on the issue of his dying declaration and is admissible to impeach or to sustain the declaration. This is an exception to the usual rule that evidence as to the general moral character
                        of the deceased is not admissible in a prosecution for homicide. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 21</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 771 (1978).

                            Section Amends Common-Law Rule. - Under the common law, communications which passed between a patient and a physician in the confidence of the professional relation and information acquired by the physician while attending or treating the patient were
                            not privileged or protected from disclosure by the physician. This section as interpreted by the Supreme Court has the effect of amending this common-law rule. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                            21, 167 S.E.2d 841 (1969).

                            It is the purpose of statutes such as this section to induce the patient to make full disclosure that proper treatment may be given, to prevent public disclosure of socially stigmatized diseases, and in some instances to protect patients from self-incrimination.

                            The underlying purpose of the privilege under this section is to encourage free communication and disclosure between patient and physician to facilitate the proper diagnosis and treatment of the patient's ailment; the denial of this privilege would result
                            in the patient withholding information vital to the proper treatment of her ailment for fear of publicity exposing facts of an embarrassing or confidential nature. Jones v. Asheville Radiological Group,

                            Purposes of North Carolina's statutory physician-patient privilege is to encourage the patient to fully disclose pertinent information to a physician so that proper treatment may be prescribed, to protect the patient against public disclosure of socially
                            stigmatized diseases, and to shield the patient from self-incrimination; accordingly, the proviso allowing for compelled disclosure of privileged information is intended to refer to exceptional rather than ordinary factual
                            situations. Mims v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 339, 578 S.E.2d 606 (2003).

                            Purpose of Section Must Be Carried Out at Superior Court Level. - If the spirit and purpose of this section is to be carried out, it must be at the superior court level. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                            21, 167 S.E.2d 841 (1969).

                            The principle by which a physician may not be compelled to divulge communications and other matters which have come to his knowledge by observation of his patient is regulated by statute, and under the provisions of this section, the privilege is qualified,
                            and it rests within the discretion of the trial judge, in the administration of justice, to compel the physician, called as a witness, to testify to such matters when relevant to the inquiry. State v. Martin,

                            Compelled Disclosure in Exceptional Situations. - In view of the primary purpose of this section to create a privileged relationship between physician and patient, it is clear that the provision regarding compelled disclosure is intended to refer to exceptional,
                            rather than ordinary, factual situations. Lockwood v. McCaskill, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 754</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 67 (1964).

                            Proper Administration of Justice. - This section sets forth the procedure to compel disclosure of information which ordinarily is protected by the doctor-patient privilege. Such information may be disclosed by order of the court if in the opinion of the
                            trial judge disclosure is necessary to the proper administration of justice. This decision is one made in the discretion of the trial judge, and the defendant must show an abuse of discretion in order to successfully challenge
                            the ruling. State v. Drdak, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 587</cite>, 411 S.E.2d 604 (1992).

                            This section and G.S. 8-53.3 are to be read in pari materia. When so read, they extend the physician-patient privilege to the psychologist-client situation and withdraw the privilege in all situations where "necessary to a proper administration of justice."
                            The reasons for the exceptions to the privileges granted by the two statutes are the same and it would be discordant to fail to extend to G.S. 8-53.3 the amendment of this section which made it clear that the legislature intended
                            that disclosure could be compelled prior to trial. In re Albemarle Mental Health Center, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 256 S.E.2d 818, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 297</cite>,

                            Statutory Authority for Requesting and Releasing Medical Records. - Trial court did not err by admitting defendant's medical records showing that the defendant had an elevated blood alcohol level at the time of his motorcycle crash into evidence since
                            G.S. 8-53 was not the only statute under which patient medical records could be requested and released, and defendant failed to show that his medical records were obtained in violation of 45 C.F.R.

                            insofar as the records contained entries made by physicians and surgeons, or under their direction, pertaining to communications and information obtained by them in attending the insured professionally, which information was
                            necessary to enable them to prescribe for her. However, any other information contained in the records, if relevant and otherwise competent, was not privileged. Sims v. Charlotte Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,

                            Information Is No Less Privileged Because It Was Obtained in Hospital. - There is no difference in the application of the statute between examination and treatment of the patient by a physician or surgeon in a hospital and in the home. The information
                            is no less privileged that it was obtained in a hospital. Sims v. Charlotte Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 32</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 326 (1962).

                            Cross-examination of defendant's psychiatrist concerning incriminating statements made by defendant did not violate defendant's statutory right to privileged communication with his doctor on the basis that no bona fide doctor-patient relationship existed
                            between defendant and his expert witness, or on the basis that, even assuming a valid relationship, defendant waived his right to the privilege by putting the doctor on the stand. State v. Clark,

                            Medical records are protected by this section, which sets forth the physician-patient privilege, and because this statutory privilege is to be strictly construed, the patient bears the burden of establishing the existence of the privilege and objecting
                            to the discovery of such privileged information; moreover, the privilege is not absolute and may be waived, either by express waiver or by waiver implied from the patient's conduct. Mims v. Wright,

                            Implied waivers of the physician-patient privilege occur where: (1) the patient fails to object to testimony on the privileged matter; (2) the patient calls the physician as a witness and examines him or her as to the patient's physical condition; (3)
                            the patient testifies to the communication between himself or herself and the physician; or (4) a patient, by bringing an action, counterclaim, or defense directly places his or her medical condition at issue. Mims v. Wright,

                            Patient-physician privilege conferred by G.S. 8-53 was impliedly waived because the decedent and later the executor of the decedent's estate placed the decedent's mental health and history of substance abuse at issue by bringing a claim for emotional
                            distress. Spangler v. Olchowski, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 654 S.E.2d 507 (2007).

                        <p>
                            The privilege is waived by implication where the patient calls the physician as a witness and examines him as to patient's physical condition, where patient fails to object when the opposing party causes the physician to testify, or where the patient
                            testifies to the communication between himself and physician. Neese v. Neese, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 161 S.E.2d 841 (1968); Cates v.

                            Effect of Implied Waiver. - The defendants were not entitled to summary judgment on the patient's claim for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, where neither the waiver of the privilege implied by the patient's filing of a medical malpractice
                            action against her former physician and others for misdiagnosis of breast cancer nor her conduct during the course of the action allowed defendants who were not parties to the action to disclose her mammography films to the
                            expert who was testifying as an expert for the defendant physician absent her authorization or the use of appropriate discovery procedures. Jones v. Asheville Radiological Group, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. App.</cite>                            449, 500 S.E.2d 740 (1998).

                            In a wrongful termination suit, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by ordering plaintiff's production of requested medical records for a period beginning five years prior to service of the discovery request because by claiming emotional distress,
                            she impliedly waived the patient-physician privilege when she brought an action which placed her medical condition at issue. Young v. Kimberly-Clark Corp., <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite>                            172, 724 S.E.2d 552 (2012).

                            Where plaintiff used an affidavit of his physician for the purpose of obtaining a temporary restraining order pending the hearing of his case on the merits, such use did not waive the physician-patient privilege. Neese v. Neese,

                            Waiver by Patient's Testimony Describing Nature of Injuries in Detail. - While a patient does not waive his right to assert that a communication between himself and his physician is privileged by merely testifying as to his own physical condition, where
                            the patient voluntarily goes into detail regarding the nature of his injuries, he waives the privilege, and the physician is competent and compellable to testify in regard thereto, since the patient will not be allowed to close
                            the mouth of the only witness in a position to contradict him and fully explain the facts. Capps v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 18</cite>, 116 S.E.2d 137 (1960).

                        <p>
                            A patient may surrender his privilege in a personal injury case by testifying to the nature and extent of his injuries and the examination and treatment by the physician or surgeon. Whether the testimony of the patient amounts to a waiver of privilege
                            depends upon the provisions of the applicable statute and the extent and ultimate materiality of the testimony given with respect to the nature, treatment, and effect of the injury or ailment. The question of waiver is to be
                            determined largely by the facts and circumstances of the particular case on trial. Neese v. Neese, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 161 S.E.2d 841 (1968).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a patient voluntarily testifies in detail about his injuries and his medical treatment, he waives the privilege, and the adverse party may examine the physician. Green ex rel. Green v. Maness, <cite class="nc_code">69 N.C.

                            Plaintiff May Not Waive Privilege as to Information But Not as to Other Matters. - When the patient breaks the fiduciary relationship with the physician by revealing, or permitting revelation of, the substance of the information transmitted to the physician,
                            the patient has, in effect, determined that it is no longer important that the confidences which the privilege protects continue to be protected. Having taken this position, the plaintiff may not silence the physician as to
                            matters otherwise protected by the privilege. Cates v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 1</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 734 (1987).

                        <p>
                            Such as Opinions. - There is no statutory basis for allowing a patient to waive his privilege as to information gained by his physician while maintaining it as to his physician's opinions. Cates v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 1</cite>,
                            361 S.E.2d 734 (1987).

                        <p>
                            When a patient dissolves the fiduciary relationship with his physician by disclosing or permitting disclosure of details of their consultations, he should not, in fairness, be allowed to prevent the physician from stating an opinion which might aid the
                            trier of fact in assessing the merits of the patient's case. To hold otherwise would enable patients to use the privilege not defensively to protect their confidences but offensively to suppress the truth in litigation. Cates
                            v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 1</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 734 (1987).

                            Following Waiver, Plaintiff May Not Prohibit Physicians from Testifying for Defendant. - A plaintiff who has waived his physician-patient privilege as to nonparty treating physicians may not preclude these physicians from testifying as experts for the
                            defendant. Cates v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 1</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 734 (1987).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Once a plaintiff waives his right to prohibit disclosures of confidences by his physicians, he may not assert the physician-patient privilege to prevent them from testifying as experts for his opponent. Cates v. Wilson,

                            Legislative Intent. - The legislature intended to employ the phrase "may compel such disclosure" in this section in such manner as to authorize the court to require disclosure in all situations governed by this section without exception, when disclosure
                            "is necessary to a proper administration of justice." In re Albemarle Mental Health Center, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 256 S.E.2d 818, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 297</cite>,

                            Disclosure May Be Compelled Prior to Trial or Filing of Charges. - Construing this section and G.S. 8-53.3 so as to give effect to the obvious intention of the legislature as manifested in the entire act and other acts in pari materia, the language of
                            both of these sections is sufficient to allow the trial court to compel disclosure prior to trial and prior to the filing of criminal charges when such action is necessary to the exercise of its implied or inherent powers to
                            provide for the proper administration of justice. In re Albemarle Mental Health Center, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 292, 256 S.E.2d 818, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 297</cite>,

                            Trial Judge May Compel Disclosure. - The legislature was careful to make provision to avoid injustice and suppression of truth by putting it in the power of the trial judge to compel disclosure. Sims v. Charlotte Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,

                            The judge, in the exercise of discretion and by the authority of the proviso in this section, may follow the procedure for the admission of testimony and admit hospital records in evidence. Sims v. Charlotte Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,

                            The statutory privilege is a qualified one, and the judge may compel disclosure by the physician if he finds, in his discretion, that it is necessary for the proper administration of justice. State v. Mayhand, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 418</cite>,

                            The procedural aspects of the statutory physician-patient privilege, established in this section, are qualified. It is within the discretion of the trial judge alone to compel a physician called as a witness to testify for the proper administration of
                            justice as to matters within the physician-patient relationship. Carter v. Colonial Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 278 S.E.2d 893, cert. denied,

                            This section creates only a limited physician-patient privilege, because a trial judge may compel disclosure and deny defendant the benefit of the privilege if this is necessary for the proper administration of justice. State v. Taylor,

                            But Only as to Matters Necessary to Proper Administration of Justice. - The trial judge may ascertain from the physician the nature of the evidence involved and may determine what part, if any, should be disclosed as necessary to the proper administration
                            of justice. Obviously, the proper administration of justice might require disclosure as to certain but not as to all matters under the privilege. Lockwood v. McCaskill, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 754</cite>,

                            This section requires, and the decisions of the Supreme Court are to the effect, that the trial judge may admit communication between physician and patient if in his opinion such is necessary to a proper administration of justice. State v. Bryant,

                            Privileged medical information may still be discoverable if disclosure is necessary to a proper administration of justice; the decision that disclosure is necessary to a proper administration of justice is one made in the discretion of the trial judge,

                            Unclear Whether Specific Findings Required - Whether the trial court has to make a specific finding that disclosure of privileged material is necessary for the proper administration of justice is unclear as this section does not require such an explicit
                            finding, and the finding is implicit in the admission of the evidence; however, caselaw has held that a trial court may permit opinion evidence by non-party treating physicians only after finding, pursuant to the statute, that
                            the proper administration of justice necessitates such testimony, and that the trial court is required to make a finding, appearing in the record, that disclosure is necessary to a proper administration of justice. Mims v.

                            Judge's Finding of Record That Testimony Is Necessary. - Before a physician may testify to matters arising in his confidential relationship with his patient, this section requires that the trial judge find that in his opinion such testimony is "necessary
                            to a proper administration of justice," and in the absence of such finding appearing of record on appeal, it is reversible error for the trial judge upon defendant's exception to admit testimony of the insured's physician tending
                            to show that the insured in his application for life insurance had made misstatements of material facts that would avoid the insurer's liability in his suit to cancel the policy issued thereon. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.

                            If the statements were privileged under this section, then in the absence of a finding by the presiding judge, duly entered upon the record, that the testimony was necessary to a proper administration of justice, it was incompetent, and upon defendant's
                            objection should have been excluded. Sawyer v. Weskett, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 500</cite>, 160 S.E. 575 (1931).

                        <p>
                            Where the presiding judge compels disclosure, as provided by this section, he shall enter upon the record his finding that the testimony is necessary to a proper administration of justice. Sims v. Charlotte Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.,

                            In the absence of a finding by the trial court that, in its opinion, the admission of hospital records was necessary to a proper administration of justice, the appellate court is compelled to hold that their exclusion was not error. Sims v. Charlotte

                        <p>
                            The superior court's finding, inserted in the record, that the evidence of a physician was necessary to a proper administration of justice, takes the physician's evidence out of the privileged communication rule provided in this section. State v. Howard,
                            <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 519</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 350 (1968).

                        <p>
                            A judge of superior court at term may, in his discretion, compel disclosure of physician-patient communications if, in his opinion, it is necessary to a proper administration of justice and he so finds and enters such finding on the record. Neese v. Neese,
                            <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 426, 161 S.E.2d 841 (1968).

                        <p>
                            In construing this section it is incumbent on the presiding judge to find the fact, and this should appear in the record in substance, that, in his opinion, the disclosure is necessary to a proper administration of justice. State v. Bryant,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 21, 167 S.E.2d 841 (1969).

                            Express Recital of Findings Held Unnecessary. - Although the trial judge made no express recital of findings that the testimony of a psychiatrist in a sterilization proceeding was necessary to the proper administration of justice, his opinion that such
                            was the case was implicit when he overruled respondent's objection to the testimony asserting the privilege under this section. It must be assumed that the judge was aware of the statute when he made the ruling, and that under
                            these circumstances the very act of ruling was in itself a finding that its admission was necessary to a proper administration of justice. In re Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite>                            133, 243 S.E.2d 386 (1978).

                        <p>
                            Substantial Compliance with Section. - Where the district attorney filed a motion requesting the court to compel disclosure of defendant's medical records and the court found that "the results of the analysis of the defendant's blood is needed for evidence"
                            and ordered the hospital to furnish the reports of all tests and treatment of defendant for the dates in question, this constituted substantial compliance with the statute. State v. Miller,

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Failure to give defendant notice of the hearing on the motion to compel disclosure and defendant's absence when the motion was heard was not reversible error, since defendant could have appealed the disclosure order and any prejudice to defendant was
                            cured when defendant had the opportunity to be heard on this matter at the pretrial voir dire hearing of defendant's motion to suppress the results of defendant's blood test. State v. Miller,

                            Child Abuse Cases. - By virtue of G.S. 8-53.2 and 7A-551 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba03s7B-310" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-310</a></cite>], the physician-patient privilege, created by G.S.

                            Any privilege which the defendant, who sought treatment of a sexually transmittable disease after he had been charged with sexual crimes against his children and taken into custody, might have been entitled to this section was nullified by G.S. 8-53.1
                            and 7A-551 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba03s7B-310" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-310</a></cite>]. State v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 34</cite>, 352

                            Disclosure Properly Compelled. - In a prosecution for possession of heroin, the trial court did not err in ruling that a physician should be required in the interests of justice to give testimony concerning a matchbox containing heroin found on defendant's
                            person when she was undressed in a hospital emergency room in order that the physician could determine the cause of her unconsciousness. State v. Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite>                            269, 196 S.E.2d 603, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 670</cite>, 197 S.E.2d 879 (1973).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the trial court received evidence and heard arguments before ruling that the privilege should be waived and the testimony allowed into evidence, the record failed to establish that this ruling could not have been the result of a reasoned decision.
                            State v. Fullwood, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 371</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 518 (1988), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1464, 108 L. Ed. 2d 602 (1990) in
                            light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990).

                        <p>
                            When defendant was charged with second-degree murder for causing another's death by his drunk driving, his medical records, showing the concentration of alcohol in his blood immediately after the incident, were properly admitted, under G.S. 8-53, because
                            the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the admission of such records was necessary for the proper administration of justice. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite>                            128, 623 S.E.2d 73 (2005).

                        <p>
                            Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a driver to produce privileged medical records, which mentioned or reflected the results of any tests performed to determine the driver's blood alcohol content and the presence of controlled substances
                            in his body at the time of the accident, in the interest of justice. Roadway Express, Inc. v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 631 S.E.2d 41 (2006).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was not an abuse of discretion to partially compel the discovery of medical records of former patients who were not parties to a malpractice case; careful consideration was given since only some of the records had to be produced, information was redacted,
                            and the need for an in camera inspection was recognized. Brewer v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 762 S.E.2d 654 (2014).

                            Disclosure Improperly Compelled - Driver did not waive physician-patient privilege simply by driving, and the trial court abused its discretion in compelling the production of her medical records where the injured party did not contend that the driver's
                            medical condition contributed to the accident, and the driver did not contend that she was injured, but merely denied the allegation of negligence and asserted contributory negligence of the injured party, in the alternative.

                        Evidence That Defendant Sought Treatment of Sexually Transmitted Disease. - Any privilege which defendant, who sought treatment of a sexually transmittable disease after he had been charged with sexual crimes against his children and taken into custody,
                        might have been entitled to by G.S. 8-53 was nullified by this section and G.S. 7A-551 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba03s7B-310" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-310</a></cite>].

                    <p>
                        Evidence That Defendant in Sexual Abuse Case Had Gonorrhea. - Unequivocal evidence that a seven-year old girl had been sexually abused would invoke this section and G.S. 7A-551 [see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba03s7B-310" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-310</a></cite>].
                        Therefore, medical records maintained by a county health department, revealing that the defendant had been treated for gonorrhea, were admissible as evidence with regard to the cause or source of the child's disease. State v. Efird,

                    <p>
                        Privilege Is Statutory. - Apart from this statute, there is no privilege with reference to communications between a clergyman or other spiritual advisor and his communicants or others who seek his advice and comfort. In re Williams,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967), commented on in 45 N.C.L. Rev. 863, 884, 924 (1967).

                    <p>
                        Two Statutory Requirements. - For the clergyman's privilege to apply the defendant must be seeking the counsel and advice of his minister, and the information must be entrusted to the minister as a confidential communication. State v. Andrews,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 370, 507 S.E.2d 305 (1998).
                            <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Expectation of Trust and Confidentiality in Covered Communications. - The legislature's excision of the term "confidential" from the current version of this statute was clearly not intended to broaden application of the privilege to all genre of general
                        conversation with one's spiritual mentor, but merely to broaden the range of advisory and counseling practices to which it applies. The expectation of trust and confidentiality inherent in communications covered under the prior
                        statute was not affected by the legislature's modification in 1967 of that statute's wording. State v. West, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 219</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 186 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        No Discretion in Court to Compel Disclosure When Privilege Exists. - The 1967 amendment to this section revealed the General Assembly's intent to remove from the trial courts any discretion to compel disclosure when the clergy-communicant's privilege
                        exists. State v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 502</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 441 (1986).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Minister Related to Defendant. - In a criminal trial, the trial court erred in allowing the mother of the victim, who was also the defendant's aunt and a minister, to testify with respect to statements made by defendant when she visited defendant while
                        he was in jail, as this witness was acting at least in part in her professional capacity as a minister. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 832, 336 S.E.2d 437 (1985), cert. denied,
                        <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 199</cite>, 341 S.E.2d 572 (1986).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Limited Waiver Was Proper. - Trial court did not err by allowing a husband a limited waiver of the clergy-communicant privilege to allow examination of a minister regarding the husband's marriage counseling sessions with his wife during one month, but
                        refusing to allow him to elicit testimony from the minister regarding other counseling sessions because the clergy-communicant privilege was absolute; further, the trial court reviewed the minister's notes and properly found that
                        the notes contained no references during the time frames specified by defendant that established an earlier "discovery date" by the husband of the affair that was the basis of the underlying criminal conversation lawsuit. Misenheimer
                        v. Burris, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 408, 644 S.E.2d 611 (2007).

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Privilege Held Inapplicable. - This section was not applicable where the person to whom defendant confided was not an ordained or licensed minister of any church and did not hold any office in any church, although he had preached from the pulpit several
                        times and had taught Sunday school, and where the court found that the defendant did not make statements while seeking spiritual comfort and guidance, but that they were conversational statements in which he confided to a friend.
                        State v. Barber, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 502</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 441 (1986).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where preacher, who had told defendant's wife the day before that defendant needed help and that he was going to try to help him, sought out defendant for that purpose, and meeting attended by defendant, preacher and the preacher's wife was not one in
                        which defendant had any reason to expect confidentiality, as the conversation appeared to be one in which the preacher was offering his advice and counsel, but not one in which defendant's admissions were entrusted to him in pursuit
                        of such counsel and advice, this section did not apply. State v. West, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 219</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 186 (1986).

                    <p>
                        Clergy-communicant privilege was not applicable to statements defendant made in the presence of a church elder who was not an ordained minister or clergyman. State v. Pulley, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 636 S.E.2d

                        disclosure over defendant's objection on the basis that it was "necessary to the proper administration of justice" as allowed by this section, acted properly, since under the second paragraph of this section the psychologist-patient
                        privilege did not exist. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 378 S.E.2d 424, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 230</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 789 (1989).

                    <p>
                        Applicability of Privilege to Competency Examination. - No psychologist-client privilege is created when a defendant is examined at his request by a court-appointed psychologist for purposes of evaluating defendant's mental status, and even if they were
                        the court could compel disclosure if the records were "necessary to the proper administration of justice." State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 1</cite>, 510 S.E.2d 626 (1999), cert. denied
                        528 U.S. 880, 120 S. Ct. 193, 145 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1999).

                    <p>
                        Authority to Compel Evidence. - It was not error for a trial court to admit certain evidence in a child neglect and dependency case that violated the mother's psychologist-patient privilege; under G.S. 8-53.3, the court had the authority to compel disclosure
                        of otherwise privileged information if, in his or her opinion, it was necessary to a proper administration of justice, and the mother's psychological condition was a major issue in the determination that her son was neglected.

                        Order Compelling Disclosure Upheld. - Trial court's order that the marriage counselor disclose counseling session records was not erroneous in light of the state's theory of the case, that defendant conspired with and aided and abetted her lover in the
                        murder of her husband, as the testimony of the marriage counselor was surely relevant. State v. Theer, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 349, 639 S.E.2d 655 (2007), cert. denied, - U.S. - , 128

         I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
        </b>
                        </h5>
                        <p>
                            Change from Common Law. - To correctly interpret and apply this section, it should be remembered that at common law, both in England and in this country, parties were not competent witnesses and were not permitted to testify. Nonetheless, an admission
                            of guilt by defendant was competent evidence just as it is competent today. Then, as now, the law applied and gave effect to the assumption that one charged with crime and wrongful conduct would not remain silent when he had
                            an opportunity to speak. Such silence was evidence of guilt. Thus, when the barrier was removed preventing the accused from testifying and according him a privilege, it was proper to provide that his failure to utilize the
                            privilege so given should not be regarded as an implied admission. State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 465</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 61 (1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 832, 81 S. Ct. 45, 5 L.
                            Ed. 2d 58 (1960), overruled on other grounds, State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 539</cite>, 380 S.E.2d 118 (1989).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Prior to the adoption of this section defendants in criminal actions were not competent to testify in their own behalf. The prevailing theory prior to the adoption of this section was that the frailty of human nature and the overpowering desire for freedom
                            would ordinarily induce a person charged with crime, if permitted to testify, to swear falsely. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 170 S.E.2d 640 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the common-law rules of evidence, which declared that parties were incompetent to testify, were changed by this section, an important privilege was extended to defendants, guarded by the provision that a failure to exercise it should raise no presumption
                            of guilt against them. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 148</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 10, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 932, 97 S. Ct. 339, 50 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1976).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The common-law disqualification against interested parties testifying was removed by this section. State v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 291</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 917 (1942).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Privilege and Not a Duty. - A defendant in a criminal matter can only be examined as a witness by his own request. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. 447</cite>, 2 S.E. 525 (1887).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This section gives a criminal defendant the privilege of testifying in his own behalf. It is not his duty to do so, and he cannot be compelled to testify. If he does, however, he occupies the position of any other witness. He is entitled to the same privileges
                            and is equally liable to be impeached or discredited. State v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 202 S.E.2d 293, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 364</cite>,
                            204 S.E.2d 675 (1974).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The word "presumption" as used in this section is equivalent to what is at present generally understood by the word "inference." State v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 167 S.E.2d 24 (1969).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The law is that the jury is not to infer guilt from the fact that the defendant neither testifies nor presents evidence. State v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 206 S.E.2d 729 (1974).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant Treated as Other Witnesses. - When the defendant exercises this privilege he is treated just as any other witness and thereby subjects himself to all the disadvantages of that position. State v. Efler, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. 585</cite>                            (1881); State v. Hawkins, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 712</cite>, 20 S.E. 623 (1894); State v. Auston, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 203</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 613 (1943).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where a defendant in a criminal prosecution testifies in his own behalf he waives his constitutional privilege not to answer questions tending to incriminate him and is subject to cross-examination for the purpose of impeaching his credibility as other
                            witnesses. State v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 541</cite>, 160 S.E. 826 (1931).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If a defendant in a criminal action testifies, he occupies the position of any other witness, and he is entitled to the same privileges and is equally liable to be impeached or discredited. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 663</cite>,
                            185 S.E.2d 174 (1971).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No Instruction Required When Defendant Testifies. - When the defendant testifies, the trial court is not required to instruct the jury, upon request or otherwise, that the defendant cannot be compelled to testify. State v. Walden,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">311 N.C. 667</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 577 (1984).
                                <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Contradiction of Testimony. - Defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated where State was permitted to show for purposes of impeachment that defendant had not voluntarily turned himself in to the police, and defendant had already
                            testified to the contrary. State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 239</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 268 (1976).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Comment on Failure to Produce Exculpatory Evidence. - A prosecutor may not make any reference to or comment on a defendant's failure to testify. However, a defendant's failure to produce exculpatory evidence or to contradict evidence presented by the
                            state may properly be brought to the jury's attention by the state in its closing argument. State v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 724</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 430 (1986).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the prosecutor did no more than comment on defendant's failure to produce witnesses and evidence to refute the state's case, her statements did not constitute an impermissible comment on defendant's failure to take the stand. State v. Mason,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">315 N.C. 724</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 430 (1986).
                                <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Evidence of Other Offenses Where Defendant Does Not Testify. - When the defendant in a criminal trial does not testify, evidence of other offenses is inadmissible if its only relevancy is to show the character of the accused or his disposition to commit
                            an offense of the nature of the one charged; such evidence will be admissible, however, if that evidence is used to show intent, design, guilty knowledge, or scienter or to make out the res gestae or to exhibit a chain of circumstances
                            in respect of the matter on trial, when the other offenses are so connected with the offense charged as to throw light on one or more of these questions. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite>                            173, 272 S.E.2d 785 (1980), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 399</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 353 (1981).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where There Are Two or More Defendants. - Even prior to the enactment of this section on a trial for an affray, one defendant could not oppose the testifying of his codefendant for himself, the State's counsel not objecting. State v. Hamlett,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">85 N.C. 520</cite> (1881).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Failure of Codefendant to Take Stand. - A codefendant on trial cannot be required over his own objection to testify as a witness for defendant. State v. Hanford, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 191 S.E.2d 910,
                            cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 428</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 841 (1972).

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant may properly raise a violation of this section for the first time on appeal. State v. Fleming, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 234 S.E.2d 431, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 161</cite>,

                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the absence of an indication to the trial court that defendant wished to take the stand, it could not be said that the court denied defendant his right to testify. State v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 460</cite>,
                            334 S.E.2d 741 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Testimony May Be Used in Subsequent Trial. - Where a defendant, in a prosecution for another crime, testified in his own behalf, after having been informed of his privilege not to testify, admissions made by him are competent evidence against him in a
                            subsequent trial. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 676</cite>, 45 S.E. 567 (1903).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Error in Sustaining Objections Held Waived. - In a prosecution for first-degree murder, where defendant contended that the trial court erred in sustaining the State's objections to several of his attempts to explain his answers, thereby violating his
                            right to testify in his own behalf pursuant to this section, any error by the trial court in sustaining the State's objections was cured when the evidence sought to be admitted was subsequently admitted without objection. State

                            Defendant's General Character Can Be Shown. - When a prosecutor or defendant in a criminal action goes upon the stand as a witness he becomes just as any other witness, and his general character can be proven, not only as it was before a charge affecting
                            it was made, but as it is at the date he goes upon the stand. State v. Spurling, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 1250</cite>, 24 S.E. 533 (1896).

                            But His Character Is Not in Issue Unless So Placed. - Where a defendant goes on the witness stand and testifies, he does not thereby put his character in issue, but only puts his testimony in issue, and the State may introduce evidence tending to show
                            the bad character of the witness solely for the purpose of contradicting him. State v. Foster, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 666</cite>, 41 S.E. 284 (1902); State v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 567</cite>,

                        <p>
                            And When He Does Not Testify, His Character Is Not in Issue. - When defendant does not go upon the stand, and does not offer evidence of good character, his character is not in issue and it may not be impeached by the State. State v. Proctor,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">213 N.C. 221</cite>, 195 S.E. 816 (1938).

                        <p>
                            Unless a defendant in a criminal prosecution testifies as a witness, thereby subjecting himself to impeachment, or produces evidence of his good character to repel the charge of crime, the State may not show his bad character for any purpose. State v.
                            McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 251</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 537 (1952).

                            Introduction of Evidence of Good Character by Defendant. - The right of the defendant to offer testimony of his good character does not depend upon his having been examined as a witness in his own behalf. State v. Hice,

                            When the defendant introduces evidence himself to prove his good character, then that evidence is substantive evidence, and may be considered by the jury as such. State v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 567</cite>,
                            63 S.E. 154 (1908).

                            Use of Character Evidence Introduced by State. - Where, in the trial of a criminal action, the defendant testified in his own behalf and introduced no evidence as to his general character, but the State introduced evidence to show that such character
                            was bad, it was held that such evidence by the State could be considered only as affecting the credibility of the defendant as a witness and not as a circumstance in determining the question of his guilt or innocence. State

                            Extent of Cross-Examination Permitted. - Cross-examination of a defendant under this section is not confined to matters brought out on direct examination, but questions are admissible to impeach, diminish or impair the credit of the witness. State v.
                            Dickerson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 327</cite>, 127 S.E. 256 (1925).

                        <p>
                            When a defendant voluntarily becomes a witness in his own behalf, he is subject to cross-examination and impeachment as any other witness, and it is proper for the solicitor (now district attorney) to ask him questions concerning his prior criminal record
                            for the purpose of impeaching him, provided the questions are based on information and are asked in good faith. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 165 S.E.2d 15 (1969).

                            It is permissible, for purposes of impeachment, to cross-examine a witness, including the defendant in a criminal case, by asking disparaging questions concerning collateral matters relating to his criminal and degrading conduct. State v. Williams,

                            In order to impeach a defendant's credibility as a witness, the solicitor (now district attorney) is permitted to cross-examine the defendant as to collateral matters, including other criminal offenses, if the questions are based upon information and
                            are asked in good faith. State v. Lea, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 193 S.E.2d 383 (1972), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 674</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 154 (1973).

                            While defendant in a criminal action may not be required to become a witness unless he voluntarily does so, once he does so, he becomes subject to cross-examination and may be required to answer questions designed to impeach or discredit him as a witness.

                        <p>
                            Cross-examination by the State is permitted for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, and not for the purpose of proving prior offenses. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>,

                        <p>
                            In cross-examination, the witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, may be asked all sorts of disparaging questions and he may be particularly asked whether he has committed specified criminal acts or has been guilty of specified reprehensible
                            or degrading conduct. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).

                        <p>
                            A testifying defendant is subject to impeachment by cross-examination, generally to the same extent as any other witness. State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 239</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 268 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Once a defendant testifies, he assumes the status of any other witness and is subject to impeachment by the questions and arguments of opposing counsel. These arguments may include comments on the witness's failure to explain or deny incriminating evidence
                            since, if an innocent explanation exists or a denial can properly be made, the witness may reasonably be expected to provide it. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 365</cite>, 241 S.E.2d

                        <p>
                            For purposes of impeachment, a defendant as witness may be cross-examined by the district attorney concerning prior inconsistent statements, prior convictions, and any specific acts of misconduct which tend to impeach his character. State v. Herbin,
                            <cite

                            Same - Discretion of Trial Judge. - The limits of legitimate cross-examination of a defendant are largely within the discretion of the trial judge and, absent a showing that the verdict was improperly influenced by his rulings on the scope of that cross-examination,
                            those rulings will not be held for error. State v. Lea, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 193 S.E.2d 383 (1972), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 674</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 154

                            The scope of cross-examination of a criminal defendant is subject to the discretion of the trial judge and the questions must be asked in good faith. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125
                            (1975); State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 372</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 222, death penalty vacated, Carter v. North Carolina, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).

                        <p>
                            The scope of the cross-examination of a defendant with regard to specific acts of criminal and degrading conduct for which there has been no conviction is normally subject to the discretion of the trial judge, and the questions must be asked in good faith.
                            The purpose of this rule permitting such a wide scope for impeachment is that such evidence is a proper and relevant means of aiding the jury in assessing and weighing the credibility of the defendant. State v. Ross,

                            Witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, cannot be impeached by cross-examination as to whether he has been arrested for, indicted for, or accused of an unrelated criminal offense. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Cross-examination for impeachment purposes is not limited to conviction of crimes. State v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 47</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 320 (1975).

                        <p>
                            Trial judge did not err in admitting defendant's testimony under cross-examination of prior criminal convictions where the district attorney repeatedly asked defendant what he had been convicted of, not what he had been charged with, it was defendant
                            who unresponsively volunteered information as to charges, and defendant's motion to strike all testimony as to charges was allowed and the judge instructed the jury to disregard all of it. State v. Lester,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">289 N.C. 239</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 268 (1976).

                            Inquiry of a witness, including a defendant, into prior convictions for certain crimes is relevant to impeach the witness. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 223 S.E.2d 575 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where the defendant on cross-examination testified about an additional conviction for assault with a firearm which he had failed to mention during his direct examination, this was relevant impeachment evidence, thus, it was not only proper, it was also
                            prudent for the prosecutor to attempt to elicit further details about defendant's prior convictions. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 272 S.E.2d 384 (1980).

                            And Specific Acts of Misconduct. - Where a defendant in a criminal case testifies in his own behalf, specific acts of misconduct may be brought out on cross-examination to impeach his testimony. State v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 47</cite>,
                            220 S.E.2d 320 (1975).

                        <p>
                            Trial judge did not err in allowing cross-examination of defendant concerning the circumstances of his undesirable discharge from military service. State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 239</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 268

                            Cross-examination for purposes of impeachment of a defendant who testifies in his own behalf is not limited to questions concerning prior convictions, but also extends to questions relating to specific acts of criminal and degrading conduct for which
                            there has been no conviction. State v. Ross, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 488</cite>, 246 S.E.2d 780 (1978).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When a defendant becomes a witness and testifies in his own behalf, he is subject to cross-examination like any other witness, and, for purposes of impeachment, he may be cross-examined by the district attorney concerning any specific acts of misconduct
                            which tend to impeach his character. State v. Galloway, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 485</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 509 (1981).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            By choosing to testify, a defendant is subject to cross-examination as other witnesses; defendant waived his privilege against self-incrimination regarding bad acts when he elected to testify. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite>                            604, 372 S.E.2d 905 (1988).

                        <p>
                            Where defendant testified on direct examination that he had no intent of selling cocaine until he was approached by the informant, he raised the issue of entrapment, and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,
                            Rule 404(b) allowed the State on cross-examination to question defendant concerning the prior sale to undercover police to prove absence of entrapment; therefore defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated
                            by the questions. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 372 S.E.2d 905 (1988).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where defendant first testified that he had never possessed any cocaine, it was then proper impeachment for the district attorney to ask the defendant about bags containing cocaine residue found in the defendant's possession when he was arrested. State
                            v. Wooten, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 125, 408 S.E.2d 202 (1991).

                            Cross-Examination as to Conviction Subsequently Set Aside. - While it was improper for the solicitor (now district attorney) to cross-examine defendant concerning a conviction for felonious assault when this conviction had been subsequently set aside
                            and on retrial defendant had been convicted only of simple assault - if the solicitor (now district attorney) knew such was the case - defendant was hardly prejudiced when he had admitted convictions for a large number of different
                            criminal offenses committed over a long period of years. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 165 S.E.2d 15 (1969).

                        <p>
                            Denial of Impeaching Questions. - When defendant denies impeaching questions as to his prior criminal record, his answers are conclusive in the sense that they cannot be rebutted by other evidence, but the solicitor is not precluded from rephrasing his
                            questions to include such details as the docket number of the case, the name of the court, the date of trial, the offense charged, and the sentence imposed. State v. Weaver, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite>                            439, 165 S.E.2d 15 (1969).

                            Contradicting Witness's Denial of Prior Offenses. - Denial of prior offenses by a witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, may not be contradicted by introducing the record of his conviction or otherwise proving by other witnesses that he was,
                            in fact, convicted. State v. Monk, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975).

                            Defendant May Be Recalled for Further Cross-Examination. - A defendant who avails himself of the privilege of testifying in his own behalf is subject to being recalled for further cross-examination, since the court has full discretion to allow a witness
                            to be examined at any stage of the trial out of the usual order or to be recalled for reexamination. State v. Austin, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 202 S.E.2d 293, rev'd on other

                            A defendant's failure to testify may not be considered an admission of the truth of testimony which tends to incriminate him. State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 472</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 132 (1975).

                            It is the privilege, but not the duty, of a party to an action to offer himself as a witness in his own behalf, and he is not the proper subject for unfriendly criticism because he declines to exercise a privilege conferred upon him for his own benefit
                            merely. The fact is not the subject of comment at all, certainly not unless under very peculiar circumstances, which must be necessarily passed upon by the judge presiding at the trial, as a matter of sound discretion. Gragg

                            Comment by Court. - The failure of defendant to testify in his own behalf should not be made the subject of comment by the court except to inform the jury that a defendant may or may not testify in his own behalf as he may see fit, and that his failure
                            to testify does not create any presumption against him. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 377</cite>, 49 S.E.2d 733 (1948); State v. Bovender, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 683</cite>,

                            Trial court in a prosecution for armed robbery did not improperly comment on defendant's failure to testify when defense counsel stated he was going to introduce defendant into evidence and the court replied, "He'll have to take the witness stand," since
                            the court's remark merely explained evidentiary procedure. State v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 117, 282 S.E.2d 504 (1981).

                            This section is interpreted as denying the right of counsel to comment on the failure of a defendant to testify. The reason for the rule is that extended comment from the court or from counsel for the State or defendant would tend to nullify the declared
                            policy of the law that the failure of one charged with crime to testify in his own behalf should not create a presumption against him or be regarded as a circumstance indicative of guilt or unduly accentuate the significance
                            of his silence. To permit counsel for a defendant to comment upon or offer explanation of the defendant's failure to testify would open the door for the prosecution and create a situation that this section was intended to prevent.

                            New Trial Ordered. - Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the trial court erroneously overruled his objection to the prosecution's closing comments about defendant's decision not to testify in trial for felonious breaking or entering; the error
                            was prejudicial and required a new trial. State v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 551</cite>, 434 S.E.2d 193 (1993).

                            Statement That Defendant Was Hiding Behind Wife's Coat Tail. - Where defendant's wife and several other witnesses testified in his behalf, but he did not testify, to say that the defendant was "hiding behind his wife's coat tail" was tantamount to commenting

                            Inquiry in Superior Court as to Failure to Testify Below. - In a superior court trial for driving under the influence, the State, by inquiring into defendant's failure to testify in district court, did more than attempt to impeach the defendant with his
                            prior silence, considering his allegedly belated attempt to establish a defense, but also adversely implicated defendant's right not to testify in district court. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite>                            156, 330 S.E.2d 225, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 333</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 492 (1985).

                            This section does not restrict the prosecuting attorney from making comments upon the evidence and drawing such deductions therefrom as would have been legitimate before the passage of the act, for, while enlarging the rights of the defendants, this section
                            did not abridge the privileges of the prosecution. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 148</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 10, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 932, 97 S. Ct. 339, 50 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1976); State

                            The purpose of this section is not to restrict the prosecutor from making such comments upon the evidence and drawing such deductions therefrom so long as the prosecutor does not call attention to defendant's failure to testify. State v. Richardson,

                            Statements made by prosecutor regarding the demeanor of the defendant were not comparable to statements previously held to be improper comments on a defendant's failure to testify. State v. Bates, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 564</cite>,
                            473 S.E.2d 269 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1131, 117 S. Ct. 992, 136 L. Ed. 2d 873 (1997).

                            A bare statement by the prosecution to the effect that the State's evidence was uncontradicted was not an improper reference to the defendant's failure to testify. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 148</cite>,
                            226 S.E.2d 10, cert. denied, 429 U.S. 932, 97 S. Ct. 339, 50 L. Ed. 2d 301 (1976).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although the prosecution is forbidden from commenting on the failure of a defendant to testify at trial, a prosecutor's statement that the state's evidence was uncontradicted does not constitute an improper reference to defendant's failure to testify.
                            State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 772</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 685 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 890, 117 S. Ct. 229, 136 L. Ed. 2d 160 (1996).

                            Veiled Reference to Defendant's Failure to Testify. - Trial judge did not err in failing to intervene ex mero motu where any reference by the district attorney to defendant's failure to testify was at the most "a veiled reference," so brief and indirect
                            as to make improbable any contention that the jury inferred guilt from the failure of the defendant to testify. State v. Styles, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 596, 379 S.E.2d 255 (1989).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            The State may fairly draw the jury's attention to the failure of the defendant to produce exculpatory evidence or to contradict the State's case. State v. Tilley, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 132</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 433 (1977).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The district attorney had a right to comment on defendant's failure to account for the hours between 4:30 and 6:45 p.m., especially after the defendant had offered evidence tending to establish an alibi. The prosecutor's remarks were directed solely at
                            defendant's failure to offer evidence rebutting the State's case, rather than at his failure to take the stand. State v. Stanfield, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 357</cite>, 233 S.E.2d 574 (1977).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a case in which defendant was convicted by a jury on two counts first-degree murder on the bases of felony murder and of malice, premeditation and deliberation and, after a capital sentencing proceeding, he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of
                            life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, defendant argued unsuccessfully on appeal that the trial erred by failing to intervene ex mero motu to exclude comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. The
                            prosecution responded to defendant's attacks on two individuals and made permissible comments on defendant's failure to produce witnesses or exculpatory evidence to contradict or refute evidence presented by the State; the
                            prosecution's remarks did not constitute a direct reference to his failure to testify and did not require a curative instruction. State v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 204,
                            683 S.E.2d 437 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 857</cite>, 694 S.E.2d 766 (2010).

                        <p>
                            Prosecutor's calling the jury's attention to defendant's demeanor made no reference to or inference about his decision not to testify, and did not violate his constitutional and statutory privilege not to testify. State v. Brown,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">320 N.C. 179</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 970, 108 S. Ct. 467, 98 L. Ed. 2d 406 (1987).

                            Comment by Defense Counsel on Defendant's Failure to Testify. - Defense counsel was entitled to read to the jury that clause of U.S. Const., Amend. V, material to his election not to testify, i.e., "No person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case
                            to be a witness against himself" and to say simply that because of this provision, the jury must not consider defendant's election not to testify adversely to him, or words to this effect. State v. Banks,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">322 N.C. 753</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 398 (1988).

                            Comments Elicited by Defense Counsel. - Trial court did not err in allowing police officer's comments on murder defendant's decision to exercise her constitutional right to remain silent upon her arrest; the comments were elicited by the defense counsel
                            and defense counsel repeatedly asked officer to explain his answers and did not object to, or move to strike the comments. State v. Jennings, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 579</cite>, 430 S.E.2d
                            188 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1028, 114 S. Ct. 644, 126 L. Ed. 2d 602 (1994).

                            Prohibiting Defense from Reading U.S. Const., Amend. V to the Jury Held Not Reversible Error. - The trial court did not commit reversible error in prohibiting the reading to the jury of that portion of U.S. Const., Amend. V, pertinent to the defendant's
                            election not to testify, where in his general instructions to the jury, the judge gave an accurate and complete statement of the law applicable to defendant's election not to testify. State v. Banks,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">322 N.C. 753</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 398 (1988).

                            Exception to improper remarks of counsel during the argument must be taken before verdict. The rationale for this rule is that a party cannot be allowed to speculate upon his chances for a verdict, and then complain because counsel were not arrested in
                            their comments upon the case. Such exceptions, like those to the admission of incompetent evidence, must be made in apt time, or else be lost. State v. Hopper, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 580</cite>,

                            Exception in Death Cases. - The general rule that exception to improper remarks of counsel during the argument must be taken before verdict has been modified in recent years so that it does not apply to death cases, when the argument of counsel is so
                            prejudicial to the defendant that in this court's opinion, it is doubted that the prejudicial effect of such argument could have been removed from the jurors' minds by any instruction the trial judge might have given. State
                            v. Hopper, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 580</cite>, 234 S.E.2d 580 (1977).

                        <p>
                            A slip of the tongue in an instruction on defendants' failure to testify will not be held to be prejudicial error if not called to the attention of the court and if it does not appear that the jury could have been prejudiced thereby. State v. Willis,
                            <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 206 S.E.2d 729 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Prosecution's statements directed at defendant's failure to produce rebuttal or alibi evidence at trial for robbery with dangerous weapon, were not directed at defendant's failure to testify on his own behalf; therefore, these comments were not in error.
                            State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 429 S.E.2d 590 (1993).

                            Failure to Object - Trial court did not err by allowing a detective to testify that defendant refused to make a statement to police because defendant did not object to that testimony during trial; also, the trial court did not have an obligation to give
                            the jury a curative instruction, sua sponte, after a witness who testified stated during cross-examination that, if defendant didn't agree with what the witness said, defendant should defend himself. State v. Batchelor,

                            Improper comment on defendant's failure to testify may be cured by an instruction from the court that the argument is improper, followed by prompt and explicit instructions to the jury to disregard it. State v. Monk,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">286 N.C. 509</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 125 (1975); State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If the defendant elects not to testify as a witness in his own defense, any comment by the solicitor (now district attorney) calling attention to this failure is improper; but where the presiding judge carefully instructs the jury that defendant's failure
                            to testify in his own defense should not be construed in anywise to his prejudice, the presiding judge properly and effectively removes any prejudicial effect that might result from the solicitor's (now district attorney) argument.
                            State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 430</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 115 (1962).

                            If the district attorney improperly comments on defendant's failure to testify, the error may be cured by a withdrawal of the remark or by a statement from the court that it was improper, followed by an instruction to the jury not to consider the failure
                            of the accused to offer himself as a witness. State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 472</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 132 (1975); State v. Peplinski, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 236</cite>, 225

                            When a prosecutor improperly comments upon the accused's failure to testify, the error may be cured if the trial judge (1) sustains an objection to the comment; (2) tells the jury that the comment was improper; and (3) instructs the jury to disregard
                            the comment and not to consider the failure of the accused to offer himself as a witness. State v. Oates, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 112, 308 S.E.2d 507 (1983), cert. denied,

                            An instruction by the trial court immediately after sustaining an objection to a prosecutor's comment on the defendant's failure to testify, that the defendant's exercise of his right not to testify shall not be used against him, is insufficient absent
                            an instruction that the argument was improper and that it should be disregarded. State v. Oates, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 112, 308 S.E.2d 507 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 747</cite>,

                        <p>
                            Trial court's curative instruction to the jury following the prosecutor's comment at trial was sufficient, even though not made immediately after the prosecutor's comments, as the the trial court stated that the comment was improper, and the statement
                            was followed by an instruction to the jury not to consider the failure of the accused to offer the accused as a witness. State v. Kemmerlin, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 446</cite>, 573 S.E.2d

                            To be effective, the trial court's instruction should immediately follow the offensive remark and should explain why the remark was improper. The fact that the remark was made by a private prosecutor makes no difference. State v. Oates,

                            New Trial If No Curative Instruction on Improper Argument Is Given. - When there is an objection to prohibited statements on the failure of the defendant to testify, it is the duty of the court not only to sustain objection to the prosecuting attorney's
                            improper and erroneous argument but also to instruct the jury that the argument was improper with prompt and explicit instructions to disregard it. If no proper curative instruction is given, the prejudicial effect of the argument
                            requires a new trial. State v. Soloman, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 600, 253 S.E.2d 270 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Request Curative Instruction. - Where defendants failed to promptly object to the prosecutor's statement and decided against requesting a curative instruction when this was suggested by the trial court, they were not entitled to a new trial
                            for the failure of the trial court to grant relief, since the statement was not so grossly improper as to require the trial court to act ex mero motu. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>,
                            321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).

                        <p>
                            It is better practice not to instruct on the defendant's failure to testify. State v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 313</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 629 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Unless Defendant Requests Such an Instruction. - Ordinarily, it would seem better to give not instruction concerning a defendant's failure to testify unless such an instruction is requested by the defendant. State v. Powell,

                                class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 181 S.E.2d 754, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 396</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 243 (1971); State v. Rankin, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 572</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 740 (1973); State v. Bryant,

                        <p>
                            Right to Instruction Upon Request. - A nontestifying defendant has the right, upon proper request, to have the court tell the jury in substance that his failure to take the witness stand and testify in his own behalf does not create any presumption against
                            him. State v. Leffingwell, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 205, 237 S.E.2d 550 (1977).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This statute prohibits the prosecution, the defense, or the trial judge from commenting upon the defendant's failure to testify. A nontestifying defendant, however, has the right upon request to have the trial court instruct the jury that his failure
                            to testify may not be held against him. State v. Randolph, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 198</cite>, 321 S.E.2d 864 (1984).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Such Instruction Is Discretionary Absent Request. - Court need not charge that failure of defendant to testify should not be considered against him in absence of request. State v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 356</cite>,
                            5 S.E.2d 156 (1939); State v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 235</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 419 (1977).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The failure of the trial court to instruct the jury upon the effect of defendant's failure to testify is not error, because such an instruction is not required unless specifically requested by defendant. State v. Smith,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 211 S.E.2d 539 (1975), overruled on other grounds, State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 539</cite>, 380 S.E.2d 118 (1989).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under this section the trial judge is not required to instruct the jury that a defendant's failure to testify creates no presumption against him unless defendant requests the instruction. In fact, it is better not to give such an instruction unless defendant
                            requests it. State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 713, 280 S.E.2d 175 (1981).

                        <p>
                            But Giving Unrequested Proper Instructions Is Not Reversible Error. - Giving unrequested proper instructions relating to the failure of the defendant to exercise his right to testify or refrain from testifying under the provisions of this section is not
                            reversible error. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 181 S.E.2d 754, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 396</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 243 (1971).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it is the better practice to give no instructions on the defendant's failure to testify, there is no error in giving an unrequested instruction on defendants' failure to testify if it correctly states the law. State v. Willis,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 465, 206 S.E.2d 729 (1974).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial court did not err in instructing the jury regarding defendant's failure to testify, even though defendant did not request the instruction. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 238 S.E.2d 201
                            (1977).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is not always prejudicial error to give an unrequested instruction regarding defendant's failure to testify or present evidence. There is no prejudicial error if the instruction makes clear to the jury that the defendant has the right to offer or to
                            refrain from offering evidence as he sees fit and that his failure to testify should not be considered by the jury as basis for any inference adverse to him. State v. Chambers, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite>                            713, 280 S.E.2d 175 (1981).

                        <p>
                            What Instruction Must State. - Any instruction is incomplete and prejudicially erroneous unless it makes clear to the jury that the defendant has the right to offer or to refrain from offering evidence as he sees fit and that his failure to testify should
                            not be considered by the jury as basis for any inference adverse to him. State v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 285</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 352 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1091, 96 S. Ct.

                        <p>
                            Language of Statute Should be Used. - The better practice is for the trial judge to use the language employed in this section without additions if there is a request for such instructions. State v. Powell, <cite class="nc_code">11 N.C. App.</cite>                            465, 181 S.E.2d 754, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 396</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 243 (1971).

                        <p>
                            An instruction which incorporates the precise language of this section is not only acceptable, but it has often been suggested as being the preferred instruction. State v. Penland, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite>                            73, 200 S.E.2d 672 (1973), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 621</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 692 (1974).

                        <p>
                            Instructions Upheld. - The court's remarks to the jury in instructing them that defendant was within his rights in not testifying, and that his failure to testify should not be considered against him, were held without error upon defendant's exception.
                            State v. Horne, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 725</cite>, 184 S.E. 470 (1936).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A charge to the effect that a defendant has a right not to testify and that his failure to testify should not be considered as a circumstance against him will not be held for error on the ground that it called to the jury's attention the fact of defendant's
                            absence from the stand. State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 740</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 491 (1949).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            No hard and fast form of expression or consecrated formula is required, but the jury may be instructed that, as to the defendant, the jury should scrutinize his testimony in the light of his interest in the outcome of the prosecution, but that if after
                            such scrutiny the jury believes that the witness has told the truth, it should give his testimony the same weight it would give the testimony of any other credible witness. It was not mandatory that the judge charge the jury
                            in this respect, but the charge was permissible and appeared to be the uniform practice. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">6 N.C. App.</cite> 611, 170 S.E.2d 640 (1969).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The trial judge's statement in his charge to the jury did not constitute prejudicial error where the charge, taken as a whole, did not give the jury the impression that defendant's failure to present evidence was to be taken against him. State v. Harlow,
                            <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 312, 191 S.E.2d 900 (1972).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court's instruction that the jury must be very careful not to allow defendant's silence to influence their decision in any way did not constitute prejudicial error, though an instruction more nearly in the language of this section would have been
                            preferable. State v. House, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 97, 193 S.E.2d 327 (1972); State v. Phifer, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 101, 193 S.E.2d 413 (1972), cert. denied,

                        <p>
                            Although it is the better practice to give no instruction concerning the failure of defendant to testify unless he requests it, the trial court's instruction in a first degree murder case to the effect that defendant's failure to testify should not be
                            considered by the jury was not prejudicial to defendant. State v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 227</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 509 (1973).

                        <p>
                            Where an instruction was unduly repetitious, but stripped of unnecessary verbiage the instruction was that a defendant may or may not testify in his own behalf as he sees fit, and that his failure to testify shall not be held against him to any extent,
                            this instruction met the requirements of this section. State v. Caron, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 467</cite>, 219 S.E.2d 68 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 971, 96 S. Ct. 2168, 48 L. Ed. 2d 794

                            Trial judge's instruction to the jury that they "should" not consider defendant's failure to take the stand against him, rather than that they "shall" not consider his failure to take the stand against him, was not error. State v. Sellers,

                            While it is better practice to use the words of the statute, i.e., "shall not create any presumption against him," the use of the words "should not" in an instruction concerning defendant's failure to testify was not such error as to require a new trial.
                            State v. Boone, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 702</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 459 (1977).

                            Instructions Held Improper. - While the interpretations of this section require defendant's testimony to be scrutinized, it was the province of the jury to determine from his demeanor and the attending circumstances the weight which they would accord
                            his testimony, and a charge of the court that "the law presumes" that he is naturally laboring under the temptation to testify to whatever he thinks may be necessary to clear himself and that the jury should take into consideration
                            what a conviction would mean to defendant, etc., was held to impose a burden and cast a shadow upon his testimony greater than the law required and constituted reversible error. State v. Wilcox,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">206 N.C. 691</cite>, 175 S.E. 122 (1934).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While it is proper for the court to instruct the jury to scrutinize testimony of a defendant in a criminal prosecution because of his interest in the verdict, it was error for the court to fail to follow such instructions with a charge that if after such
                            scrutiny the jury found him worthy of belief they should give his testimony as full credit as they would that of any other witness. State v. Dee, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 509</cite>, 199 S.E.
                            730 (1938).

                        <p>
                            A charge to the jury to "very carefully and very cautiously scrutinize" defendant's testimony is not to be commended. State v. Auston, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 203</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 613 (1943).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instruction that the defendants "did not offer any evidence as they have the right to do" was incomplete and prejudicially erroneous. State v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 735</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 696 (1974).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Court's instruction to disregard the remark, "Why in the world did the defendant sit here for these one-and-a-half days remaining mute and not come to the stand?" was insufficient where the court did not instruct that the remark was improper nor why it
                            was improper. State v. Oates, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 112, 308 S.E.2d 507 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 747</cite>, 315 S.E.2d 708 (1984).

                    bank, faro table or other gaming table, or place where alcoholic beverages are sold contrary to law, and the name and personal description of the keeper thereof. Such evidence, when obtained, shall be considered and held in law as
                    an information on oath, and the justice, magistrate or judge may thereupon proceed to seize and arrest such keeper and destroy such table, or issue process therefor as provided by law. No person shall be excused, on any prosecution,
                    from testifying touching any unlawful gaming done by himself or others; but no discovery made by the witness upon such examination shall be used against him in any penal or criminal prosecution, and he shall be altogether pardoned

                            privilege law. However, because of liberal discovery, the court and the parties can intelligently choose whether to give effect to state privilege law by severing the trial of the state law claims in federal court or dismissing

                        <p>
                            Confidential Communications During Marriage Are Protected. - The confidential communications made between husband and wife which neither will be compelled to disclose are those which are communicated "during their marriage." Whitford v. North State Life
                            Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 223</cite>, 79 S.E. 501 (1913).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The confidential communications between husband and wife cannot, on the grounds of public policy, be admitted in evidence. State v. Brittain, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 783</cite>, 23 S.E. 433 (1895).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And Privileged. - A confidential communication between husband and wife is privileged and neither spouse may be compelled to disclose it when testifying as a witness. Hicks v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 204</cite>,
                            155 S.E.2d 799 (1967).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Whatever is known by reason of marriage should be regarded as knowledge confidentially acquired, and neither husband nor wife should be allowed to divulge it to the danger or disgrace of the other. Hicks v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 204</cite>,
                            155 S.E.2d 799 (1967).

                            But Communications in Presence of Others Are Not Protected. - A communication made in the known presence of a third person, or one relating to business matters which in their nature might be expected to be divulged, is not protected. Hicks v. Hicks,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">271 N.C. 204</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 799 (1967).

                            Nonwitness spouse holds the privilege and may prevent the witness spouse from testifying about confidential communications. Scott v. Kiker, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 458, 297 S.E.2d 142 (1982).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            A tape recording, made by the husband without the wife's knowledge, of a conversation between them while alone, except for the presence of their eight-year-old child who was singing and playing at the time, was incompetent evidence over the wife's objection.
                            Hicks v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 204</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 799 (1967).

                        <p>
                            Letters from Husband to Wife. - In a suit in equity to set aside a judgment rendered in an action at law for fraud, letters from the plaintiff in the former action to his wife respecting fraud in that action were properly excluded, when the letters were
                            obtained by a third party with the consent of the wife, the letters being privileged communications and inadmissible against either the husband or the wife. McCoy v. Justice, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 602</cite>,
                            155 S.E. 452 (1930).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Where a witness for the State had written a letter to his wife, and his wife, without his knowledge or consent, had given the letter to the defendant, the witness could not be cross-examined relative to the letter in an attempt to prove bias. State v.
                            Banks, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 233</cite>, 167 S.E. 851 (1933).

                        <p>
                            Acts of Sexual Intercourse. - In the wife's action for alimony and alimony pendente lite, the wife may not be compelled to answer interrogatories which seek to elicit her answers under oath as to acts of sexual intercourse between the husband and wife,
                            since such an act is a "confidential communication" within the meaning of this section. Wright v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 159</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 317 (1972).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Admission of a police officer's testimony that he heard defendant say to his wife, "I am in real trouble this time" did not violate the marital privilege since the communication was not confidential as it was made within the hearing of a third party,
                            and at any rate the privilege refers only to testimony by a spouse about the confidential communication. State v. Setzer, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 98, 256 S.E.2d 485, cert. denied,
                            <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 571</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 127 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Transactions Between Spouse and Ward. - Where testimony did not relate to confidential communications between the witness and her husband during their marriage, but to the relationship and transactions between the witness and ward and between defendant
                            and ward, there was no error in admitting it. Ashley v. Delp, <cite class="nc_code">59 N.C. App.</cite> 608, 297 S.E.2d 905 (1982), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 190</cite>, 302 S.E.2d

       Editor's Note.
      </b> - Session Laws 1985 (Reg. Sess., 1986), c. 843, s. 6, initially provided that the act, which amended subsection (b), would become effective October 1, 1986, and expire October 1, 1988, but that the expiration date would
                    not affect the term or authority of a grand jury constituted at that time. Session Laws 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988), c. 1040, s. 1, as amended by Session Laws 1989 (Reg. Sess., 1990), c. 1039, s. 4, extended the expiration date of Session
                    Laws 1985 (Reg. Sess., 1986), c. 843, s. 6, to October 1, 1993. Subsequently, Session Laws 1991, c. 686, s. 3, amended Session Laws 1985, c. 843, s. 6, as amended by Session Laws 1987, c. 1040, so as to delete the October 1, 1991 expiration
                    provision. However, the 1991 amendment, which was in the coded bill drafting format set out at G.S. 120-20.1, did not mention or take account of Session Laws 1989 (Reg. Sess., 1990), c. 1039, s. 4.

                            Evidence rendered incompetent by this section is excludable and failure to do so is reversible error. State v. Holmes, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 398 S.E.2d 873 (1990), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 826</cite>,

                            Applicability of Section to Common-Law Marriages. - Common-law marriages are invalid in North Carolina. Hence, the husband-wife testimonial privilege granted in this section may not be asserted by a criminal defendant to disqualify a witness alleged to
                            be his spouse by virtue of a common-law marriage contracted in North Carolina. This State, however, will recognize as valid a common-law marriage if the acts alleged to have created it took place in a state in which such a
                            marriage is valid. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 465</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 242 (1979).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Privilege Belongs to Spouse. - Under subsection (b) of this section, the privilege belongs to the spouse, not to the defendant. Once challenged, the better practice is for the trial judge to advise the spouse that he or she cannot be compelled to testify
                            in cases where this statute applies, and then to determine whether the spouse is in fact still willing to testify. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 705</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 660 (1987).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The sole prohibition of subsection b is now directed to compelled testimony. State v. Rush, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 174</cite>, 456 S.E.2d 819 (1995).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As amended in 1986, this section embodies the common law rule that a defendant's spouse may be compelled to testify against a defendant for the State, and reflects judicial abrogation of the common law rule that a spouse is incompetent to testify against
                            the defendant spouse. State v. Rush, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 174</cite>, 456 S.E.2d 819 (1995).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            The spousal privilege does not bar nonconfidential, out-of-court statements made by a spouse and introduced against a defendant spouse for the State through a third party. State v. Rush, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 174</cite>,
                            456 S.E.2d 819 (1995).

                        <p>
                            Rationale of cases decided prior to State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 591</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 450 (1981), holding that a spouse's out-of-court statements are inadmissible against the defendant spouse for the State,
                            no longer applies. State v. Rush, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 174</cite>, 456 S.E.2d 819 (1995).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Spousal Privilege Not Bar to Statement. - Defendant's counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel by not renewing an objection to the admissibility of a statement that defendant made to the defendant's spouse regarding the killing of the
                            victim; the statement did not involve a confidential communication pursuant to G.S. 8-57(c) because it was made within the hearing of a third person and, thus, the statement was admissible. State v. Kirby,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 653 S.E.2d 174 (2007), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 241</cite>, 660 S.E.2d 493 (2008).

                        <p>
                            This section preserves the rule against disclosure of confidential communications. While this section modifies the rule against adverse spousal testimony, it preserves the rule against disclosure of confidential marital communications. State v. Holmes,
                            <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 826</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 660 (1992).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A confidential communication between husband and wife is privileged and that this privilege, even in criminal cases, survives both the North Carolina Rules of Evidence and the 1983 amendment to this section. The statute makes it clear that neither spouse
                            may be compelled to disclose confidential communications between husband and wife when testifying as a witness. State v. Holmes, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 826</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 660 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Effect of Termination of Marriage. - When the marital relationship terminates, the asserted reasons for this section, the preservation of the sanctity of the home and the fictional oneness of husband and wife, are no longer pertinent; but evidence that
                            defendant and his wife were experiencing less than harmonious marital relations is insufficient to terminate the privilege. State v. Reavis, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 497, 199 S.E.2d
                            139 (1973).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Defendant who asked third parties to leave before he spoke to his wife in their home had the right to assert privilege against his wife and prohibit her from testifying both about his statements to her and about his actions in taking a gun out of a kitchen
                            cabinet. State v. Holmes, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 229, 398 S.E.2d 873 (1990), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 826</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 660 (1992).

                        <p>
                            Prejudicial Error Not Shown. - Assuming, arguendo, that defendant's wife was compelled to testify against defendant, the error was not prejudicial, where she essentially corroborated other witnesses' testimony, and there was not a reasonable possibility
                            that a different result would have been reached had she not testified. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 705</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 660 (1987).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Admission Not Marital Communication. - Defendant's admission to his wife that he had sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter was not a marital communication induced by the marital relationship and prompted by the affection, confidence, and loyalty engendered
                            by such relationship; rather, defendant's confession was driven by his own psychological motivations and was not a marital communication. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite>                            827, 440 S.E.2d 322 (1994).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Trial court did not err by failing to exclude the testimony of defendant's former wife about defendant's crying while looking at the composite sketch of the victim's assailant as a confidential marital communication under G.S. 8-57(c) where the incident
                            occurred as the wife was driving with defendant sitting in the passenger seat, the wife did not see defendant looking at the sketch, and no testimony indicated that defendant intended to communicate anything to his wife. State
                            v. Matsoake, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. App.</cite> 651, 777 S.E.2d 810 (2015), review denied, 781 S.E.2d 485, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 77 (2016).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Portions of testimony defendant challenged were not confidential communications for purposes of the marital communications privilege. Defendant's statements demanding sex from his wife after having repeatedly stabbed her and while still wielding a knife
                            were not prompted by the affection, confidence, and loyalty engendered by such relationship. State v. Harris, - N.C. App. - , - S.E.2d - (Mar. 4, 2021).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Conversations between defendant and his wife in the visiting areas of three correctional facilities were not admissible into evidence, based upon the marital privilege under G.S. 8-57(c), because the wife, as a result of the marital relationship, induced
                            defendant to make the statements, which were not overheard by a third party and were only obtained through the wife's participation with the police in getting defendant to make the statements. State v. Rollins,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 658 S.E.2d 43 (2008).

                            Conversations between defendant and his wife in the public areas of state department of correction (DOC) facilities where defendant was incarcerated did not qualify as confidential communications under G.S. 8-57(c) because defendant had no reasonable
                            expectation of privacy in any conversation that took place in a public visiting area of a DOC facility; for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, the traditional right to privacy was fundamentally incompatible with the close and
                            continual surveillance of inmates and their cells required to ensure institutional security and internal order. State v. Rollins, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 232</cite>, 675 S.E.2d 334 (2009).

                            Common Law. - At common law the husband or wife of the defendant in a criminal case was incompetent to testify either for the State or for the defense. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 125</cite>, 161 S.E.2d
                            575 (1968).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At common law, a husband or a wife was incompetent to testify either for or against his or her defendant-spouse in a criminal action. This section changed this rule to the effect that a husband or a wife can testify for a defendant-spouse. The common
                            law rule remains in effect, however, regarding testimony against a spouse in a criminal action. State v. Suits, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 553</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 607 (1979).

                        <p>
                            Common-Law Rule Modified. - The common-law rule prohibiting one spouse from testifying against another in a criminal action is modified so as to prohibit such testimony only if the substance of the testimony concerns a "confidential communication" between

                            In effect, this section left intact the common-law rule that a spouse is incompetent to testify against the other spouse in a criminal case. However, the common-law rule was modified so that spouses are now incompetent to testify against one another in
                            a criminal proceeding only if the substance of the testimony concerns a confidential communication. State v. Waters, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 348</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 188 (1983).

                            Effect of Section. - Under this section the husband or wife was a competent witness for the defendant in all criminal actions or proceedings. But neither was competent or compellable to give evidence against the other in any criminal proceeding. State
                            v. Harbison, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 885</cite> (1886). See State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 387</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 886 (1939).

                        <p>
                            Under this section a wife was neither competent nor compellable to testify against her husband in a criminal proceeding; hence, hearsay evidence of her declarations, not made in his presence or by his authority, which would be prejudicial to the husband,
                            was inadmissible. State v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 745</cite>, 101 S.E. 104 (1919). See State v. Cotton, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 577</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 246 (1940).

                        <p>
                            This section in effect forbade the testimony of one spouse against another in criminal proceedings unless the case fell within one of the exceptions enumerated in the statute. State v. Reavis, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite>                            497, 199 S.E.2d 139 (1973).

                            This section is an evidentiary rule and applies to a spouse testifying, or to the admission of a statement by a spouse into evidence. State v. Cousin, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 413</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 518 (1976).

                            Incompetency of Spouse to Testify for State. - Although this section made a spouse competent to testify as a witness for the defense, it did not make a spouse competent to testify in a criminal case for the State. State v. Waters,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">308 N.C. 348</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 188 (1983).

                            Declarations of One Spouse While Not in Presence of the Other. - The statutory prohibition against compelling a spouse to give evidence against the other spouse has been extended to testimony concerning declarations made by the husband or wife of the
                            defendant, while not in the presence of the defendant, even though there was no objection interposed to such testimony. State v. Fulcher, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 503</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 338

                        <p>
                            Testimony of a State's witness of a declaration of defendant's wife to the effect that if defendant had not been driving so slow "he wouldn't have been caught" entitled defendant to a new trial notwithstanding his failure to move to strike the answer,
                            since testimony of the wife against the husband was forbidden by this section, and a fortiori her declarations against him not made in his presence or by his authority were precluded by this section. State v. Warren,

                            Confidential Communications Not Admissible. - This section prohibited the admission of evidence of statements made by one spouse implicating the other. State v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 298 S.E.2d

                            When Communications Are Confidential. - In determining whether a spouse's testimony includes a "confidential communication," the question is whether the communication, whatever it contains, was induced by the marital relationship and prompted by the affection,
                            confidence, and loyalty engendered by such relationship. State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 591</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 450 (1981).

                            Admissibility of Statements Made as Agent of Spouse. - This section is a codification of a common-law rule of evidence and, as such, is subject to the same exceptions which pertain to the common-law rule. One of the exceptions is that, when one spouse
                            is made the agent of the other spouse, the statements of the agent are admissible against the principal despite the spousal relationship. State v. Overton, <cite class="nc_code">60 N.C.

                            Failure to Exclude Incompetent Testimony. - When evidence rendered incompetent by this section was admitted, it became the duty of the trial judge to exclude the testimony, and his failure to do so was held reversible error whether exception was noted
                            or not. State v. Porter, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 463</cite>, 158 S.E.2d 626 (1968); State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 431</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 487 (1976); State v. McKenzie,

                            Bigamy. - In an indictment for bigamy the first wife of the defendant is a competent witness to prove the marriage, public cohabitation as man and wife being public acknowledgments of the relation and not coming within the nature of the confidential relations
                            which the policy of the law forbids either to give in evidence. State v. Melton, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 591</cite>, 26 S.E. 933 (1897). See also, State v. McDuffie, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 885</cite>,

                            By the express provisions of this section, defendant's legal wife was a competent witness before the grand jury, which was considering an indictment against him charging him with a violation of the provisions of G.S. 14-183, "to prove the fact of marriage
                            . . . ." State v. Vandiver, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 325</cite>, 144 S.E.2d 54 (1965).

                            Prior to the 1957 amendment to this section, it was held that while in a prosecution for bigamous cohabitation, as in a prosecution for bigamy, the wife was competent to testify against the husband to prove the fact of marriage; her testimony was limited
                            to proof of the fact of marriage, and any testimony by her as to other incriminating facts, such as testimony tending to show that they had not been divorced, was incompetent. State v. Setzer,

                            Felony Committed by One Spouse Against the Other. - It appears that an exception to the general common-law rule that one spouse was not a competent witness against the other in a criminal proceeding was applicable where one spouse was tried for a felony
                            committed against the other spouse. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 190 S.E.2d 270, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 762</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 363 (1972).

                            Where defendant was charged with a serious felony which she and others allegedly perpetrated against the man she contended was her husband, the public's interest in having her brought to justice far outweighed any conceivable interest the public might
                            have had in precluding her alleged husband from testifying against her. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 190 S.E.2d 270, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 762</cite>,

                            Assault. - In case of assault and battery with intent to kill by poison, with evidence tending to show the previous threats of the wife, and that the poison was put into the food prepared by the daughter in her mother's presence at their home, and that
                            the husband was poisoned from eating thereof, the testimony of the husband as to his wife's previous threats was not inadmissible under the provisions of this section, but was admissible for the purpose of showing knowledge
                            and identifying the perpetrators of the crime, and was distinguishable from the rule that threats are ordinarily inadmissible on trials for assault and battery. State v. Alderman, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 917</cite>,

                            and was some evidence of guilt in connection with the other evidence in the case. State v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 376</cite>, 148 S.E. 450 (1929).

                            communication" between marriage partners. State v. Funderburk, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 286 S.E.2d 884 (1982).

                            Testimony as to Adultery prior to Marriage. - Where a man and woman were indicted for fornication and adultery, and a nol. pros. was entered as to the woman, her husband was a competent witness to show adultery between the defendants committed before
                            he married the woman. State v. Wiseman, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 726</cite>, 41 S.E. 884 (1902).

                            Testimony as to Conduct prior to Divorce. - A divorced husband was incompetent to testify against his divorced wife in the trial of an indictment against her for fornication and adultery which occurred prior to the divorce. State v. Raby,
                            <cite
                                class="nc_code">121 N.C. 682</cite>, 28 S.E. 490 (1877).

                        <p>
                            Where former husband or wife is prosecuted for a felony, the divorced spouse is a competent witness to testify for the State as to what occurred during the subsistence of their marriage in his or her presence when the alleged felony was being committed.

                            Conduct as Declaration Against Spouse. - Where in response to the officer's inquiry as to whether the defendant had a knife, the jury was informed that the defendant's wife left the room and returned with a pocket knife, identified as State's Exhibit
                            Number 3, this conduct was equivalent to the wife stating, "Yes, the defendant has a knife, and here it is." Thus, the court committed prejudicial error in allowing the police officer to testify to the wife's actions. State
                            v. Suits, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 553</cite>, 251 S.E.2d 607 (1979).

                            A wife under this section was not competent to testify against her husband in a prosecution for felonious burning and the admission of her testimony entitled him to a new trial. State v. Kluttz, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 726</cite>,

                            A wife's testimony that her husband shot and killed her brother in her presence in a public place was competent in a prosecution of the husband for first-degree murder of her brother, since the actions of the husband in a public place and in the presence
                            of a third person could not have been a communication made in the confidence of the marital relationship or one which was induced by affection and loyalty in the marriage. State v. Freeman,

                            Prosecutions Against Both Husband and Wife. - Where husband and wife were separately indicted for the same homicide and the prosecutions were consolidated and tried together over their objections, and the wife's testimony, though admitted only as to her,
                            was to the effect that her husband killed deceased and forced her, through fear, to confess and attempt to exculpate him, her testimony was necessarily inculpatory of the husband and impinged this section, and his motion for
                            a mistrial and severance at the conclusion of the State's evidence should have been granted. State v. Cotton, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 577</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 246 (1940).

                        <p>
                            Where testimony disclosed that any part of husband's extrajudicial statement implicating codefendant wife was deleted by the State, there was no violation of the rule of this section. State v. Mathis, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite>                            359, 185 S.E.2d 448 (1971).

                            Wife as Witness for Husband. - Where the defendant husband was alleged to have stolen certain property, it was competent for him to introduce his wife as a witness to prove from what source he got the money to pay for such property, but unless he introduced
                            her in proper time it rested within the discretion of the trial judge whether her testimony would be received. State v. Lemon, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. 790</cite> (1885).

                            Scope of Cross-Examination - When Spouse Testifies Against Defendant. - A wife cannot be compelled to testify against her husband in a criminal action; but when she takes the stand in his behalf, she is subject to cross-examination in the same manner
                            and to the same extent as any other witness. State v. Tola, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 406</cite>, 23 S.E.2d 321 (1942).

                            Same - When Spouse Testifies for Defendant. - Where defendant's wife testifies in his behalf, she is subject to be cross-examined to the same extent as if unrelated to him. State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 379</cite>,
                            106 S.E.2d 495 (1959); State v. Carey, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 254</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 387 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3209, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1209 (1976).

                        <p>
                            Prior Inconsistent Statements. - In a prosecution for murder committed in the perpetration of an armed robbery and for conspiracy to commit armed robbery, if based on information and asked in good faith, it was permissible for the district attorney to
                            ask defendant's wife about her prior inconsistent statements as they related to her previous relationship with the trigger man for purposes of impeachment. State v. Carey, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 254</cite>,
                            218 S.E.2d 387 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3209, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1209 (1976).

                            A statement by defendant's wife was admissible where the statement was not induced by the confidence of the marital relationship but, instead, was at most a casual observation. State v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite>                            152, 541 S.E.2d 166 (2000).

                        <p>
                            A statement by defendant's wife was admissible where the defendant took no steps to ensure confidentiality while obtaining the weapon and the wife's presence was merely incidental. State v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite>                            152, 541 S.E.2d 166 (2000).

                            A statement by defendant's wife was admissible where the statement merely indicated that the communication regarding the shooting took place and where the defendant was allowed to put on his brother's testimony that, immediately after the shooting, defendant
                            telephoned and told his brother that he thought he had killed someone, thereby demonstrating that defendant did not treat his statement to his wife as a confidential matter. State v. Hammonds,

                            Spousal Testimony. - In defendant's trial on charges of first degree murder, first degree burglary, second degree kidnapping, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, the trial court properly admitted the videotaped statement that defendant's wife gave to
                            police, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), after defendant's wife refused to testify for
                            the State at defendant's trial. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 577 S.E.2d 640 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 547</cite>, - S.E.2d - (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1058,

                            Failure of Spouse to Testify May Not Be Used Against Defendant. - The failure of the wife to be examined as a witness in behalf of a husband tried for a criminal offense was expressly excluded as evidence to the husband's prejudice by this section, though
                            she was competent to testify. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 600</cite>, 107 S.E. 466 (1921).

                            Duty of Court Where Improper Evidence Is Placed Before Jury. - When evidence forbidden by this section was argumentatively placed before the jury and used to the prejudice of the defense, it was the duty of the judge ex mero motu to intervene and promptly
                            instruct the jury that the wife's failure to testify and the improper argument concerning that fact had to be disregarded and under no circumstances used to the prejudice of the defendant. State v. Thompson,

                        <p>
                            Failure to Instruct Held Error. - In a prosecution for first-degree murder, where the district attorney in his argument to the jury used the failure of defendant's wife to testify on defendant's behalf to the prejudice of the defense, the failure of the
                            trial judge to intervene on his own motion and promptly instruct the jury that the wife's failure to testify and the improper argument regarding that fact must be disregarded and under no circumstances used to the prejudice
                            of the defendant was reversible error. State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 570</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 334 (1976).
                            <br />

                        <p>
                            Error in Jury Instruction Not Prejudicial - Although the trial court initially erred in permitting the prosecutor to comment upon the defendant's failure to call the defendant's spouse to testify at trial, the trial court later issued a peremptory instruction
                            that the jury should disregard the argument and that the failure of the defendant to call the defendant's spouse should not be held against the defendant; therefore, despite the fact that the instruction was insufficiently
                            detailed, the error was not prejudicial given the additional evidence concerning defendant's guilt. State v. Barden, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 316</cite>, 572 S.E.2d 108 (2002).
                            <br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Action of Court Held Insufficient to Remove Prejudice. - During the absence of the judge, the solicitor (now district attorney) in his argument to the jury called the jury's attention to the fact that defendant's wife had not testified in his behalf,
                            and persisted in the argument after objection by defendant's counsel. Upon his return, the judge sustained the objection, and near the conclusion of his charge to the jury stated that the law did not permit such comment and
                            that the jury should not let the argument influence it. The solicitor's (district attorney's) comment violated this section, and was prejudicial, and called for prompt peremptory and certain caution by the court, not only that
                            the argument should be disregarded, but that the failure of defendant's wife to testify should not be considered to his prejudice, and the action of the court in merely sustaining the objection and the caution later given by
                            the court near the conclusion of the charge was insufficient to free the case of prejudice. State v. Helms, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 592</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 243 (1940).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In a prosecution for second-degree murder, it was error for the trial judge merely to sustain an objection, without a curative instruction, to the prosecutor's comment during closing argument on the failure of the defendant's wife to testify. State v.
                            Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 328 S.E.2d 309 (1985).

                        <p>
                            Failure to Give Additional Instruction Not Error. - Where the trial judge had properly excluded from consideration by the jury testimony relating to the wife's failure to appear and testify in behalf of her husband on his trial for a homicide, the defendant
                            could not successfully complain of error on appeal in the failure of the trial judge to again instruct the jury thereon, when there had been no exception taken to the charge of the court or the refusal of any prayer for instruction
                            on the subject. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 600</cite>, 107 S.E. 466 (1921).

                    Whenever an issue of paternity of a child born or conceived during a marriage arises in any civil or criminal proceeding, the presumed father or the mother of such child is competent to give evidence as to any relevant matter regarding paternity of the

                        Presumption of Reasonableness Created. - G.S. 8-58.1 creates a mandatory presumption of reasonableness for a plaintiff's medical expenses if the medical expenses are an issue and evidence is presented showing the total charges. Griffis v. Lazarovich,
                        <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 434, 588 S.E.2d 918 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 375</cite>, 598 S.E.2d 135 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Total Charges Must Be Reasonable. - When plaintiff proffers the evidence required by this section, the fact-finder must find that the total amount of the alleged medical charges is reasonable, unless defendant carries its burden of going forward by rebutting
                        the presumed fact of reasonableness. Jacobsen v. McMillan, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 476 S.E.2d 368 (1996).

                    <p>
                        Presumption Does Not Preclude Finding of Unreasonableness. - The medical expenses presumption does not operate to preclude the jury from finding that plaintiff's medical expenses were not reasonably necessary for the proper treatment of his injuries.
                        Jacobsen v. McMillan, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 128, 476 S.E.2d 368 (1996).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Rebut Presumption. - Where the injured party testified as to her injuries and treatment and introduced her medical bills, and the tortfeasor failed to introduce any evidence to rebut the presumption that the charges in the medical bills were
                        reasonable, the reasonableness of the charges was conclusively established. McCurry v. Painter, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 553 S.E.2d 698 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Failure to Instruct As to Statutory Presumption of Reasonableness Held Not Error. - Trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury that the amount of a passenger's medical expenses was presumed reasonable under G.S. 8-58.1, even though
                        <cite
                            class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 301, required the trial court to instruct the jury of a statutory presumption; all parties stipulated to the amount of the passenger's
                            medical charges and to the reasonableness of the charges, and any instruction regarding the medical expenses would have been redundant and confusing to the jury. Griffis v. Lazarovich, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C.

                        Where evidence challenged whether an injured person's medical treatment and expenses from a collision were reasonable and necessary, and showed that the injured person had been receiving care for six years before the accident for back pain resulting from
                        a prior collision, the trial court's refusal to charge on the G.S. 8-58.1 presumption as to medical expenses was proper. Osetek v. Jeremiah, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 438, 621 S.E.2d 202

                    recognized forensic institutions, on human observer bias and sources of human error in forensic examinations. Such programs might include studies to determine the effects of contextual bias in forensic practice (e.g., studies to determine
                    whether and to what extent the results of forensic analysis are influenced by knowledge regarding the background of the suspect and the investigator's theory of the case). In addition, research on sources of human error should be closely
                    linked with research conducted to quantify and characterize the amount of error. Based on the results of these studies, and in consultation with the North Carolina Forensic Sciences Advisory Board, the North Carolina State Crime Laboratory
                    should develop standard operating procedures (that will lay the foundation for model protocols) to minimize, to the extent possible, potential bias and sources of human error in forensic science. These standard operating procedures
                    should apply to all forensic analyses that may be used in litigation."

                <p>
                    Every witness, being summoned to appear in any of the said courts, in manner before directed, shall appear accordingly, and, subject to the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.006.html#t06a08s6-51" target="_blank">G.S. 6-51</a></cite>,
                    continue to attend from session to session until discharged, when summoned in a civil action or special proceeding, by the court or the party at whose instance such witness shall be summoned, or, when summoned in a criminal prosecution,
                    until discharged by the court, the prosecuting officer, or the party at whose instance he was summoned; and in default thereof shall forfeit and pay, in civil actions or special proceedings, to the party at whose instance the subpoena
                    issued, the sum of forty dollars ($40.00), to be recovered by motion in the cause, and shall be further liable to his action for the full damages which may be sustained for the want of such witness's testimony; or if summoned in a
                    criminal prosecution shall forfeit and pay eighty dollars ($80.00) for the use of the State, or the party summoning him. If the civil action or special proceeding shall, in the vacation, be compromised and settled between the parties,
                    and the party at whose instance such witness was summoned should omit to discharge him from further attendance, and for want of such discharge he shall attend the next session, in that case the witness, upon oath made of the facts,
                    shall be entitled to a ticket from the clerk in the same manner as other witnesses, and shall recover from the party at whose instance he was summoned the allowance which is given to witnesses for their attendance, with costs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No execution shall issue against any defaulting witness for the forfeiture aforesaid but after notice made known to him to show cause against the issuing thereof; and if sufficient cause be shown of his incapacity to attend, execution shall not issue,
                    and the witness shall be discharged of the forfeiture without costs; but otherwise the court shall, on motion, award execution for the forfeiture against the defaulting witness.

                        Duty to Attend. - When a subpoena has been served on a witness, he is required by this section to attend from term to term until discharged. State v. Gwynn, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. 445</cite> (1868).

                        Attorney Not Exempt. - A witness who fails to appear when the case is called in which he has been subpoenaed to testify is not justified in his default because he is a practicing attorney at law and has cases to try in another county at the date upon
                        which the case was called wherein he was a witness, and the party who subpoenaed him can recover the penalty, with the costs of the motions. In re Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 247</cite>, 79 S.E.

                        A witness who is summoned in this State while casually here, but who resides in another state, cannot be required to pay a forfeiture for nonattendance, if he has returned to his own state and is there at his domicile. Kinzey v. King,

                        Test of Inability to Attend. - Where a witness alleges that he was unable to attend court, this inability must be decided by reference to the modes of traveling which are in use in the community. Eller v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. 11</cite>                        (1842).

                        Nonattendance Need Not Be Willful. - This section does not require that the failure of the witness to attend should be "willful." In re Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 247</cite>, 79 S.E. 507 (1913).

                        When Witness May Elect. - Where two subpoenas are served upon a witness, requiring his attendance on the same day at different places distant from each other, he is not bound to obey the writ which may have been first served, but may make his election
                        between them. Icehour v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. 478</cite> (1853).

                        Attendance Was Not Required. - ""From session to session" means that first there must be a ""session" of court at which a particular case is scheduled to be heard to trigger compulsory attendance for that case; from that point onward, a properly subpoenaed
                        witness is required to appear "from session to session" for that case until discharged. Therefore, defendant was entitled to a new trial because the trial court committed a prejudicial error when it ordered defense counsel's legal
                        assistant to appear as a witness; the assistant was directed to appear for specific dates, and the trial court did not hold a session of court at which this case was calendared on Friday, November 8, 2013. State v. Johnson,

                    Every witness shall be exempt from arrest in civil actions or special proceedings during his attendance at any court, or before a commissioner, arbitrator, referee, or other person authorized to command the attendance of such witness, and during the time

                        Common Law Rule Not Repealed. - This section does not serve to repeal the common law rule of exemption of witnesses from civil arrest. Cooper v. Wyman, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 784</cite>, 29 S.E. 947 (1898).

                        Exemption Not Applicable to Criminal Proceeding. - The exemption of witnesses from civil arrest accorded by this section, and of nonresident parties and witnesses voluntarily attending court here, on grounds of public policy does not apply to parties
                        arrested in criminal proceedings. White v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 25</cite>, 34 S.E. 104 (1899).

                        Procedure for Claiming Exemption. - Where a party has not been granted the exemption from service of summons (which the courts seem to have placed on the same plane as the exemption from civil arrest), his remedy is not a motion to dismiss the action,
                        but a motion, on special appearance, to set aside the return of service. Dell School v. Pierce, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 424</cite>, 79 S.E. 687 (1913). This is because the service is not void but
                        voidable. Cooper v. Wyman, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 784</cite>, 29 S.E. 947 (1898).

                    In all criminal actions, hearings and investigations it shall be lawful for the defendant in any such action to make affidavit before the clerk of the superior court of the county in which said action is pending, that it is important for the defense that
                    he have the testimony of any person, whose name must be given, and that such person is so infirm, or otherwise physically incapacitated, or nonresident of this State, that he cannot procure his attendance at the trial or hearing of
                    said cause. Upon the filing of such affidavit, it shall be the duty of the clerk to appoint some responsible person to take the deposition of such witness, which deposition may be read in the trial of such criminal action under the
                    same rules as now apply by law to depositions in civil actions: provided, that the district attorney or prosecuting attorney of the district, county or town in which such action is pending have 10 days' notice of the taking of such
                    deposition, who may appear in person or by representative to conduct the cross-examination of such witness.

                        Same - When Allowed at Trial. - Where it appeared that no notice had been given to the adverse party of the taking of a deposition, and that it had not been passed upon by the clerk, it was held that an objection to its reception might be taken on the
                        trial of the action. Bryan v. Jeffreys, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 242</cite>, 10 S.E. 167 (1889).

                    <p>
                        When Trial Begins. - Once the case is reached on the calendar and the jury called into the box, "the hurry of a trial" has begun and the time for deliberation and scrutiny of a deposition has passed. The purpose of this section would not be served by
                        a holding that the trial did not begin until after the jury was impaneled. Pratt v. Bishop, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 486</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 597 (1962); State v. Swann, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        385, 168 S.E.2d 429, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 644</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 611 (1969).

                    <p>
                        The trial begins when the jurors are called into the box for examination as to their qualifications - when the work of impaneling the jury begins - and the calling of a jury is a part of the trial. State v. Swann, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite>                        385, 168 S.E.2d 429, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 644</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 611 (1969).

                    <p>
                        Waiver of Formal Defects. - Where a party attends upon and takes part in taking depositions, he thereby waives all objections of a formal character, but a void process will not be vitalized unless there is an amendment without prejudice to third parties.
                        McArter v. Rhea, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 614</cite>, 30 S.E. 128 (1898).

                    <p>
                        The failure to insert the name of the commissioner in the commission to take the deposition is waived by the objecting party appearing at the taking of the deposition and making no objection thereto until after the trial was begun. Womack v. Gross,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">135 N.C. 378</cite>, 47 S.E. 464 (1904); Tomlinson Chair Mfg. Co. v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 244</cite>, 69 S.E. 145 (1910).

                <p>
                    No deposition shall be quashed, or rejected, on objection first made after a trial has begun, merely because of an irregularity in taking the same, provided it shall appear that the party objecting had notice that it had been taken, and it was on file
                    long enough before the trial to enable him to present his objection.

                        Objection Should Be Made Before Trial. - Where a deposition was open and on file before the trial, and an objection thereto was made for the first time on the trial, it was held that the objection could not be sustained. Morgan v. Royal Fraternal Ass'n,
                        <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 75</cite>, 86 S.E. 975 (1915). And this is true whether the motion is to quash the deposition in whole or in part. Carroll v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 418</cite>,
                        4 S.E. 199 (1887).

                    <p>
                        Where deposition of a witness is duly taken with full opportunity of cross-examination by the adverse party, with no objection before trial, and the witness is out of the State at the time of trial, exception to the deposition at the trial is without
                        merit. Fleming v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 568</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 544 (1952).
                        <br />

                    <p>
                        Filing as Notice. - Where the deposition had been on file for two or three months before the trial, the appellant's counsel having notice and being present when it was opened by the clerk and ordered by him to be read in evidence on the trial, and they
                        making no objections thereto, it was held that such deposition could not be quashed on oral objection made at the trial. Carroll v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">98 N.C. 418</cite>, 4 S.E. 199 (1887).
                        <br />
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Manner of Objection. - Since a deposition can be quashed only for irregularities in the taking or the incompetency of witnesses, objection should be taken to the questions and answers of the deponent by way of exception and not by motion to quash the
                        depositions. Jeffords v. Albemarle Waterworks, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 10</cite>, 72 S.E. 624 (1911).

                    <p>
                        Preservation of Exception. - Where a commissioner to take depositions has, over the objection and exceptions of a party litigant, denied him the right of cross-examination of a witness of his opponent, and the litigant has appealed therefrom to the trial
                        court, and preserved his right, the exception gives notice of the grounds upon which it was based, and on his motion on the trial, the deposition relating to that part of the evidence will be stricken. Sugg v. St. Mary's Oil Engine

                        Meaning of "Duly Summoned". - By reasonable construction subdivision (9) of this section means that where the deposition has been regularly taken, and where the witness is more than 75 miles from the place of trial without the consent of the party, and
                        the presence of the witness cannot be procured, the deposition may be read if a subpoena has been duly issued - not necessarily served. Tomlinson Chair Mfg. Co. v. Townsend, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 244</cite>,

                        Where Plaintiff Dies But Action Survives. - Where the deposition de bene esse of the plaintiff in an action had been taken in accordance with law, and the plaintiff had since died, but the cause of action survived, the deposition could properly be read
                        in evidence in behalf of those who survived him in interest, and had properly been made parties to the original action. Barbee v. Cannady, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 529</cite>, 132 S.E. 572 (1926).

                        Deposition Taken in Prior Action. - In the trial of an action a deposition regularly taken in another action between the same parties and involving the same subject matter is admissible as substantive evidence. Hartis v. Charlotte Elec. Ry.,

                        Limiting Instruction. - It would seem to be the better practice for a party wishing to limit the use of evidence offered by his opponent to request a limiting instruction at the time of its admission. State v. Kuplen, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 387</cite>,
                        343 S.E.2d 793 (1986); State v. Alston, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 373 S.E.2d 306 (1988).

                        Where many if not all of the photographs which were received into evidence could properly have been considered by the jury as substantive evidence, for the trial judge to give a proper instruction limiting the State's exhibits to illustrative use would
                        have required that the defendant specifically identify those exhibits which he contended were subject only to illustrative use. State v. Kuplen, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 387</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 793
                        (1986).

                        Defendant in robbery case argued that the judge erred in allowing the jury to view a videotape without first instructing them that it was admissible solely for the purpose of illustrating the victim's testimony; however, defendant did not request a limiting
                        instruction, and since the State laid a proper foundation to introduce the videotape for either substantive or illustrative purposes, no limiting instruction was necessary. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite>                        246, 374 S.E.2d 604 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 27</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 450 (1990).

                        Admissibility of Videotape Recordings. - The basic principles governing the admissibility of photographs apply also to motion pictures. Videotape recordings may be admitted into evidence where they are relevant and have been properly authenticated. State
                        v. Billings, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 409 S.E.2d 707 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Videotapes are admissible under North Carolina law for both illustrative and substantive purposes; the trial court properly admitted a videotape for the sole purpose of illustrating the testimony of an officer, where the trial judge properly instructed
                        the jury that the videotape was being received into evidence for the limited purpose of illustrating the witness's testimony. State v. Gaither, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 587 S.E.2d 505
                        (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 157</cite>, 593 S.E.2d 83 (2004).

                    <p>
                        Defendant's conviction of robbery with a firearm was proper; the State set a proper foundation for the admission of a videotape of the robbery under G.S. 8-97 by presenting testimony that the tape came from a store security camera, and had been in police
                        custody and had not been altered, and the probative value of the videotape was not outweighed by any undue prejudice under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,

                        Pursuant to G.S. 8-97 and G.S. 8C-1-901, the trial court properly admitted the videotape evidence of defendant committing sexual acts with the victim, a minor child, and the photographs taken therefrom, because: (1) a state agent established an unbroken
                        chain of custody from the time the tape was found in defendant's residence; (2) the state agent testified that the room depicted in the videotape shown to the jury was identical to the master bedroom in defendant's residence and
                        that the man on the videotape was defendant; (3) the victim's mother, who had previously dated defendant, testified that defendant owned a camcorder and a tripod, which he had used to videotape them having sexual intercourse in
                        the master bedroom of defendant's residence; (4) the victim's mother identified the room depicted in the videotape as defendant's master bedroom and the man on the videotape as defendant; (5) the victim's mother identified the
                        young girl on the videotape as the victim, her daughter; (6) there was testimony that defendant's camcorder was in working condition; and (7) there was sufficient evidence from the testimony regarding the chain of custody to establish
                        that the videotape had not been edited or altered, and that the same videotape seized from defendant's residence was the same videotape reviewed by the jury. State v. Prentice, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite>                        593, 613 S.E.2d 498 (2005), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, - N.C. - , 622 S.E.2d 628 (2005).

                        Videos were properly admitted where there was testimony that the videos accurately depicted the events surrounding the subject incident and that the tape had not been changed or altered, and the portions of the tape that defendant contended were inflammatory
                        were not shown at trial. State v. Buff, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 612 S.E.2d 366 (2005).

                        Trial court did not err in admitting an edited videotape of planes flying over the adjoining property owners' property in a case where they sued the airport operators based on the contention that operation of the airport was a private nuisance; the adjoining
                        property owners laid a proper foundation for admission of that evidence and the airport operators did not argue that the videotaping system was not properly maintained or properly functioning. Broadbent v. Allison,

                        Even assuming that videotapes from a food store were not properly admitted into evidence, reversal was not required because defendant was not prejudiced by their admission given the admittance of defendant's statement in which defendant confessed to using
                        the victim's credit card to purchase beer and cigarettes at the food store. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 211, 631 S.E.2d 54 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 222</cite>,

                        Trial court did not commit reversible error by admitting, as substantive evidence, a videotape recording of a controlled drug buy involving defendant, pursuant to G.S. 8-97, because the State offered the testimony of the police officers who maintained
                        and operated the camera and the State adequately established the chain of custody; the State did not need the confidential informant to testify that the tape accurately depicted the events because the videotape was admitted, without
                        volume, for substantive purposes that defendant committed a crime. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 716 S.E.2d 255 (2011).

                        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting surveillance video footage, pursuant to G.S. 8-97, collected from the scene because the State's witness testified he viewed the video as a technician made a copy of the footage immediately following
                        the incident, and further testified the footage presented in court was the same as that which he viewed when the copy was being made from the surveillance system's servers a few days after the theft; thus, the surveillance video
                        footage was properly authenticated. State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 721 S.E.2d 741 (2012), dismissed and review denied 724 S.E.2d 917, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 333 (N.C. 2012).

                        State properly authenticated a surveillance video because it presented evidence that the video surveillance system was reliable and that the video presented at trial had not been altered; the testimony of a regional loss prevention manager for the department
                        store was sufficient to authenticate the video because the manager testified that the recording equipment was industry standard and that the videos produced by the surveillance system contained safeguards to prevent tampering.

                        Under this section videotapes now may be introduced as substantive evidence upon laying a proper foundation. However, the particular nature of the video portrayal on the tape may place upon the State the burden to meet other applicable evidentiary requirements.

                        Surveillance Video of Personal Injury Plaintiffs Admissible. - A surveillance videotape was relevant and admissible in a personal injury trial on damages, where the occupants of a van were shown engaging in various physical activities, and this evidence
                        was relevant to whether and to what extent the occupants were disabled by the injuries they sustained in a rear end collision. Albrecht v. Dorsett, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 508 S.E.2d

                        Within Discretion of Court. - A "day in the life" videotape of child allegedly injured by negligence of defendant hospital at the time of her birth was properly admitted. The plaintiffs' failure to provide notice to the opposing counsel and the trial
                        court prior to taping did not render the tape inadmissible; rather, the admissibility of the videotape under the particular facts and circumstances of the action lay solely within the sound discretion of the trial court. Campbell

                        Preview of Videotape. - Where a videotape depicts conduct of a defendant in a criminal case, the trial judge should grant a request from the defense to preview the tape. State v. Billings, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite>                        362, 409 S.E.2d 707 (1991).

                    <p>
                        Insufficient Authentication of Videotape. - The state failed to sufficiently authenticate the contents of a videotape, or to establish an unbroken chain of custody, or to show that a store security system was properly functioning on the day of the robbery
                        at issue, where (1) two state witnesses expressed the opinion that the security system was in working order but neither one knew anything about the maintenance or operation of the camera system, and (2) trial testimony was insufficient
                        to establish that the tape accurately represented the events it purported to show or an unbroken chain of custody. State v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 20, 550 S.E.2d 10 (2001).

                    <p>
                        Admitting a videotape erred because no foundation was laid, as (1) the only foundation witness was not present when recording occurred or in charge of recording equipment, and (2) no chain of custody was proved, since nothing showed who copied the recording
                        onto a compact disc (CD) admitted at trial, how or when the CD was copied, or who took custody after copying. State v. Snead, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 768 S.E.2d 344 (2015).

                        Incriminating Statements in Videotape. - If a videotape contains incriminating statements by the defendant, upon his objection, the judge must conduct a voir dire to determine the admissibility of any in-custody statements or admissions in the tape. State

                        Proper Authentication of Photographs. - Where the witness clearly indicated that the photographs accurately portrayed what he had observed, the photographs were properly authenticated for illustrative purposes. State v. Alston,
                        <cite
                            class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 373 S.E.2d 306 (1988).

                    <p>
                        Confidential informant's testimony was sufficient to authenticate two of three photographs as people from whom the informant had purchased drugs in the past and the third photograph as defendant, such that it was properly admitted. However, the testimony
                        from a police detective was not sufficient to authenticate the two photographs as photographs depicting defendant's sons. State v. Murray, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 285, 746 S.E.2d 452 (2013).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err in admitting the photographs of defendant and his tattoos taken at the jail after his arrest as there was no authentication issue with the photographs because the custodial photographs did not purport to show defendant's arm at
                        the time of the robbery; and defendant did not contest that the photographs fairly and accurately depicted his arm while he was in custody. State v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite>                        637, 754 S.E.2d 478 (2014).

                    <p>
                        Trial court properly admitted a photograph because it illustrated a detective's testimony that the victim used the photograph to identify defendant; the detective testified as to how the victim located the photograph and used it to identify defendant
                        and thus, authenticated the photograph. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 801 S.E.2d 689 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Foundation Held Sufficient. - Where victim testified that the videotape was a factual representation of the events on the night of the robbery, the business had installed the camera approximately six weeks before the robbery, and that the camera was working
                        properly before and after the night of the robbery, and on voir dire a police department detective testified that he had exclusive care and custody of the video camera film since the night of the robbery, there was sufficient evidence
                        for the trial judge to find that the State had laid a proper foundation to introduce the videotape into evidence for either substantive or illustrative purposes. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite>                        246, 374 S.E.2d 604 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 37</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 450 (1990).

                    <p>
                        Where surveillance videos which an employer sought to introduce were a recording of events occurring in the service area at the employer's business, the employer laid a sufficient foundation, which consisted of evidence concerning the operation of the
                        video camera, the chain of custody of the DVDs, and testimony that the videotape had not been edited and that the picture fairly and accurately recorded the actual appearance of the area photographed, to support admission of the
                        surveillance videos; thus, the Industrial Commission erred by refusing to consider the surveillance videos as evidence. Bowman v. Cox Toyota Scion, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 737 S.E.2d

                    <p>
                        Trial court did not err by admitting two screenshots taken from defendant's social media webpage where the State presented substantial evidence that tended to show that it was defendant's webpage, as it contained content unique to defendant, including
                        his nickname, pictures of defendant and his dog, and videos of his dog, and the content was directly related to whether defendant had been criminally negligent in allowing his dog to attack and kill the victim. State v. Ford,

                    <p>
                        Foundation Held Insufficient. - The State failed to lay a proper foundation for the admissibility and authenticity of certain confiscated videotapes depicting the defendant/ex-felon handling weapons where there was no testimony by anyone present at the
                        time of the filming as to the "checking and operation" of the video equipment; the only testimony purporting to authenticate the tape was evidence that the chain of custody had not been broken; the State did not call any witnesses
                        to testify that the camera was operating properly or that the information depicted on the videotape was an accurate representation of the events at the time of filming. State v. Sibley, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite>                        584, 537 S.E.2d 835 (2000).

                    <p>
                        A proper foundation was laid for admission of a videotape of an armed robbery, where the robbery victim and two police officers testified that the taping equipment was operating properly on the day of the robbery, and an officer who viewed the videotape
                        on the day of the robbery and at trial testified that the tape was in the same condition on both occasions. State v. Mewborn, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 507 S.E.2d 906 (1998).

                    <p>
                        While the State failed to offer a proper foundation for the introduction of the surveillance video and the trial court erred by admitting the video into evidence, the error was not prejudicial, as there was no reasonable possibility that the jury would
                        have failed to convict defendant absent the video. State v. Moore, - N.C. App. - , 800 S.E.2d 734 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Admission of Prejudicial Videotapes Resulted in Reversal. - The defendant's conviction for possession with intent to sell and deliver a controlled substance was reversed where the court's admission of two videotapes - one depicting him handling various
                        weapons and communicating some sort of intimidation or threat and the other showing the defendant holding money, talking on a cell phone and holding a beer - was so prejudicial that their improper admission infected the entire
                        trial proceeding and where the only other evidence presented was that he was arrested in a home containing drugs, as well as seven other people, and that he had $433 in cash, a cell phone and a beeper on his person. State v. Sibley,
                        <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 584, 537 S.E.2d 835 (2000).

                    <p>
                        Admission of Photographs Held Proper. - Trial court's admission of nine photographs of victims' bodies was not error despite defendant's argument that photographs were repetitive and their relevancy was outweighed by their potential to inflame passions
                        of the jury, since each autopsy photograph showed a different wound, and the photographs were not gory or gruesome. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 658</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 852 (1989).

                        Erroneous Admission Not Prejudicial. - Photographs of a hole which caused injury to a moped rider were properly admitted into evidence even though they were taken five months after the accident; there was no evidence in the record suggesting that conditions
                        had changed between the time of the accident and the time the photographs were taken. Sellers v. CSX Transp., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 402 S.E.2d 872 (1991).

                        There was no abuse of discretion in the admission under G.S. 8-97 of eight autopsy photographs in defendant's criminal trial that arose from the murder of a victim in a gunfight, as there was an issue as to whether defendant shot the victim in self-defense
                        and the photographs depicted the location of the wounds and illustrated the manner of the killing; the photographs were probative and any prejudicial effect under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>,
                        N.C. R. Evid. 403 was outweighed. State v. Damenon Ropmele Early, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 670 S.E.2d 594 (2009).

                        Trial court did not err in relying on photographs that showed work completed by a carpentry company as substantive evidence in the company's breach of contract action against a builder, as a proper foundation was laid for their admission pursuant to G.S.
                        8-97; although the photographs were initially to be admitted for illustrative purposes only, the trial court had authority to change its evidentiary ruling, and the builder did not show any prejudice as a result thereof. Accelerated
                        Framing, Inc. v. Eagle Ridge Builders, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 701 S.E.2d 280 (2010).

                        Trial court properly admitted a photograph because it illustrated a detective's testimony that the victim used the photograph to identify defendant; the trial court properly instructed the jury that it was only to consider the photograph for its limited
                        purpose of illustrating and explaining detective's testimony, and the photograph was relevant to the victim's identification of defendant. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 220,
                        801 S.E.2d 689 (2017).

                    <p>
                        Although the trial court erred in admitting the surveillance video because the State failed to offer a proper foundation for it as either illustrative or substantive evidence, the error was not prejudicial because other evidence pertained to the issue
                        of whether defendant was the driver. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 803 S.E.2d 196 (2017), review denied, writ denied, stay denied, mot. dismissed, as moot, 805 S.E.2d 690,

                        Chain of Custody. - The chain of custody of a videotape was not broken by its being viewed by a district attorney on the morning of an armed robbery trial, where a police officer who had viewed the tape showing the defendant commit the robbery both on
                        the day of the offense and at trial testified that it was in the same condition and had not been edited. State v. Mewborn, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 495, 507 S.E.2d 906 (1998).
