      <p>
       Federal Preemption.
   
   - District court erred in dismissing the citizens' complaint against a private zoo for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because the federal Animal Welfare Act (AWA) did not preempt state regulation of animal welfare where the AWA permitted states to enact complementary legislation, Congress empowered the individual states to enact harmonious legislation to work in conjunction with the AWA, and the state regulation prohibited the same inhumane treatment of animals as the AWA. Salzer v. King Kong Zoo, <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. App.</cite> 120, 773 S.E.2d 548 (2015).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subject Matter Jurisdiction.
   
   - Trial court and appellate court, under G.S. 19A-1(2), had subject matter jurisdiction over an animal right organization's action against a private agency to the extent the organization's complaint generally alleged an action for unjustifiable pain, suffering, or death to animals based on the agency's immediate euthanization of cats. Justice for Animals, Inc. v. Lenoir County SPCA, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 607 S.E.2d 317 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial Court's Findings and Conclusions.
   
   - Trial court's involuntary dismissal of an animal rights organization's lawsuit against a private agency was reversed and remanded for the trial court to make proper findings under G.S. 19A-1(2) of the North Carolina Protection of Animals Statutes, to determine whether the agency's testing of cats and euthanization practices constituted unjustifiable pain, suffering, or death. Justice for Animals, Inc. v. Lenoir County SPCA, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 298, 607 S.E.2d 317 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Person."
   
   - G.S. 19A-1 and G.S. 19A-2 express the General Assembly's intent that the broadest category of persons or organizations be deemed "[a] real party in interest" when contesting cruelty to animals; thus, animal welfare advocates who filed an action challenging an animal control facility's euthanasia procedures and record-keeping were "aggrieved persons" entitled to proceed under G.S. 130A-24 where, under G.S. 19A-1, the General Assembly viewed "persons" such as the advocates to be real parties in interest for the purpose of litigation in court and where the claims concerned the enforcement of rules adopted by the local board of health. Justice for Animals, Inc. v. Robeson County, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 366, 595 S.E.2d 773 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Real Party in Interest
   
   - Animal welfare agency had standing to assert that an injunction and temporary custody order should be entered against the animal owners for the animal owners' alleged neglect and abuse of their animals despite the claim that the animal welfare agency had not suffered a legal injury itself; the North Carolina Constitution abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, leaving only one court to enforce such rights, and the legislature expressed the intent that the broadest category of persons or organizations be deemed a "real party in interest" when contesting cruelty to animals. Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Woodley, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 640 S.E.2d 777 (2007), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 690</cite>, 652 S.E.2d 254 (2007), Animal Legal Def. Fund v.

       Upon the filing of a verified complaint in the district court in the county in which cruelty to an animal has allegedly occurred, the judge may, as a matter of discretion, issue a preliminary injunction in accordance with the procedures set forth in G.S. 1A-1, Rule 65. Every such preliminary injunction, if the plaintiff so requests, may give the plaintiff the right to provide suitable care for the animal. If it appears on the face of the complaint that the condition giving rise to the cruel treatment of an animal requires the animal to be removed from its owner or other person who possesses it, then it shall be proper for the court in the preliminary injunction to allow the plaintiff to take possession of the animal as custodian.

      <li id="t19Aa01s19A-3ol1b">
       The plaintiff as custodian may employ a veterinarian to provide necessary medical care for the animal without any additional court order. Prior to taking such action, the plaintiff as custodian shall consult with, or attempt to consult with, the defendant in the action, but the plaintiff as custodian may authorize such care without the defendant's consent. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, the plaintiff as custodian may not have an animal euthanized without written consent of the defendant or a court order that authorizes euthanasia upon the court's finding that the animal is suffering due to terminal illness or terminal injury.

       Verification Requirement.
   
   - Trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider the animal welfare agency's complaint, and to enter a permanent injunction and temporary custody order; the animal owners could not show that a requirement existed that the animal welfare agency's complaint be verified, as the statute that the animal owners cited to, G.S. 19A-3, involved preliminary injunctions not permanent injunctions; G.S. 19A-4, involving permanent injunctions, did not contain verification-language requirement, and verification of a complaint was not a condition for issuance of an injunction pursuant to G.S. 1A-1-65.

       If the plaintiff prevails, the court in its discretion may include the costs of food, water, shelter, and care, including medical care, provided to the animal, less any amounts deposited by the defendant under G.S. 19A-70, as part of the costs allowed to the plaintiff under G.S. 6-18. In addition, if the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that even if a permanent injunction were issued there would exist a substantial risk that the animal would be subjected to further cruelty if returned to the possession of the defendant, the court may terminate the defendant's ownership and right of possession of the animal and transfer ownership and right of possession to the plaintiff or other appropriate successor owner. For good cause shown, the court may also enjoin the defendant from acquiring new animals for a specified period of time or limit the number of animals the defendant may own or possess during a specified period of time.

       Verification Requirement.
   
   - Trial court did not lack subject matter jurisdiction to consider the animal welfare agency's complaint, and to enter a permanent injunction and temporary custody order; the animal owners could not show that a requirement existed that the animal welfare agency's complaint be verified, as the statute that the animal owners cited to, G.S. 19A-3, involved preliminary injunctions not permanent injunctions; G.S. 19A-4, involving permanent injunctions, did not contain verification-language requirement, and verification of a complaint was not a condition for issuance of an injunction pursuant to G.S. 1A-1-65.

      Any person, firm or corporation in possession of a black bear on July 1, 1975, under an existing permit issued by the Wildlife Resources Commission, where the conditions under which such black bear is held are in violation of this Article, may immediately surrender such black bear and such permit to the Wildlife Resources Commission which shall compensate such person, firm or corporation in the amount actually paid for such bear not to exceed the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) for any one bear. In lieu of surrendering such black bear and such permit, any such person, firm or corporation may give immediately written notice to the Wildlife Resources Commission that plans and specifications for facilities to hold such bear without caging under conditions simulating a natural habitat will be submitted to the Commission for approval within 30 days thereafter. In the event such plans and specifications are not submitted within the time thus limited, or they are disapproved by the Commission, or the facilities are not completed in accordance therewith within 60 days after approval by the Commission, continued possession of a black bear by such person, firm or corporation after any of such events shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this Article, and any such black bear shall be forfeited to the Wildlife Resources Commission without compensation.

       Return of Lost Dog.
   
   - Dog's rightful owner was entitled to negotiate with plaintiffs in whatever fashion he desired in deciding whether to return the dog to plaintiffs or keep the dog and this conduct was solely as an individual and not on behalf of the Humane Society. Because defendants successfully rebutted plaintiffs' allegations of tortious conduct and demonstrated that there existed no genuine issues of material fact, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendants and dismissing plaintiffs' claims.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the uncontrolled breeding of cats and dogs in the State has led to unacceptable numbers of unwanted dogs, puppies and cats and kittens. These unwanted animals become strays and constitute a public nuisance and a public health hazard. The animals themselves suffer privation and death, are impounded, and most are destroyed at great expense to local governments. It is the intention of the General Assembly to provide a voluntary means of funding a spay/neuter program to provide financial assistance to local governments offering low-income persons reduced-cost spay/neuter services for their dogs and cats and to provide a statewide education program on the benefits of spaying and neutering pets.

       In every arrest under any provision of Article 47 of Chapter 14 of the General Statutes or under G.S. 67-4.3 or upon the commencement of an action under Article 1 of this Chapter by a county or municipality, by a county-approved animal cruelty investigator, by other county or municipal official, or by an organization operating a county or municipal shelter under contract, if an animal shelter takes custody of an animal, the  operator of the shelter may file a petition with the court requesting that the defendant be ordered to deposit funds in an amount sufficient to secure payment of all the reasonable expenses expected to be incurred by the animal shelter in caring for and providing for the animal pending the disposition of the litigation. For purposes of this section, "reasonable expenses" includes the cost of providing food, water, shelter, and care, including medical care, for at least 30 days.
      </li>
      <li id="t19Aa06s19A-70ol1b">
       Upon receipt of a petition, the court shall set a hearing on the petition to determine the need to care for and provide for the animal pending the disposition of the litigation. The hearing shall be conducted no less than 10 and no more than 15 business days after the petition is filed. The operator of the animal shelter shall mail written notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition to the defendant at the address contained in the criminal charges or the complaint or summons by which a civil action was initiated. If the defendant is in a local detention facility at the time the petition is filed, the operator of the animal shelter shall also provide notice to the custodian of the detention facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t19Aa06s19A-70ol1c">
       The court shall set the amount of funds necessary for 30 days' care after taking into consideration all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including the need to care for and provide for the animal pending the disposition of the litigation, the recommendation of the operator of the animal shelter, the estimated cost of caring for and providing for the animal, and the defendant's ability to pay. If the court determines that the defendant is unable to deposit funds, the court may consider issuing an order under subsection (f) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t19Aa06s19A-70ol1d">
       If the court orders that funds be deposited, the amount of funds necessary for 30 days shall be posted with the clerk of superior court. The defendant shall also deposit the same amount with the clerk of superior court every 30 days thereafter until the litigation is resolved, unless the defendant requests a hearing no less than five business days prior to the expiration of a 30-day period. If the defendant fails to deposit the funds within five business days of the initial hearing, or five business days of the expiration of a 30-day period, the animal is forfeited by operation of law. If funds have been deposited in accordance with this section, the operator of the animal shelter may draw from the funds the actual costs incurred in caring for the animal.
      </li>
      <li id="t19Aa06s19A-70ol1e">
       The deposit of funds shall not prevent the animal shelter from disposing of the animal prior to the expiration of the 30-day period covered by the deposit if the court makes a final determination of the charges or claims against the defendant. Upon determination, the defendant is entitled to a refund for any portion of the deposit not incurred as expenses by the animal shelter. A person who is acquitted of all criminal charges or not found to have committed animal cruelty in a civil action under Article 1 of this Chapter is entitled to a refund of the deposit remaining after any draws from the deposit in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t19Aa06s19A-70ol1f">
       Pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the court may order a defendant to provide necessary food, water, shelter, and care, including any necessary medical care, for any animal that is the basis of the charges or claims against the defendant without the removal of the animal from the existing location and until the charges or claims against the defendant are adjudicated. If the court issues such an order, the court shall provide for an animal control officer or other law enforcement officer to make regular visits to the location to ensure that the animal is receiving necessary food, water, shelter, and care, including any necessary medical care, and to impound the animal if it is not receiving those necessities.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Any order for funds to be deposited pursuant to this section shall state that if the operator of the animal shelter files an affidavit with the clerk of superior court, at least two business days prior to the expiration of a 30-day period, stating that, to the best of the affiant's knowledge, the case against the defendant has not yet been resolved, the order shall be automatically renewed every 30 days until the case is resolved.
     </p>
     <p>
      In the event of forfeiture, the animal shelter may determine whether the animal is suitable for adoption and whether adoption can be arranged for the animal. The animal may not be adopted by the defendant or by any person residing in the defendant's household. If the adopted animal is a dog used for fighting, the animal shelter shall notify any persons adopting the dog of the liability provisions for owners of dangerous dogs under Article 1A of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.067.html" target="_blank">Chapter 67</a></cite> of the General Statutes. If no adoption can be arranged after the forfeiture, or the animal is unsuitable for adoption, the shelter shall humanely euthanize the animal.
