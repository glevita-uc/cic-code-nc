    Any person except as specifically exempted below who shall publicly practice or offer to publicly practice geology in this State is subject to the provisions of this Chapter. The following persons are exempt:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li id="t89Es89E-6ol11">
     Persons engaged solely in teaching the science of geology or engaged solely in geologic research in this State may pursue their teaching and/or research without licensing. A teacher or researcher must, however, be a licensed geologist if he or she performs geologic work and services for which a licensed geologist is required by this Chapter.

    <b>
     Violations of Code of Professional Conduct.
    </b>
    - The North Carolina Board for Licensing of Geologists has the authority to investigate written charges that a geologist, licensed in North Carolina, has violated the Code of Professional Conduct; after such investigation, the Board may refuse to grant or renew, or may suspend or may revoke the license of any geologist licensed under the Act who has violated the Code, including a State official or employee performing his or her assigned duties.
   However, a State official or employee who loses his license for violations of the Code is still exempt from the provisions of the Act, and thus would not be prevented from practicing geology for the State without a license should the agency decide to retain him.

     Violations of Code of Professional Conduct.
    </b>
    - The North Carolina Board for Licensing of Geologists has the authority to investigate written charges that a geologist, licensed in North Carolina, has violated the Code of Professional Conduct; after such investigation, the Board may refuse to grant or renew, or may suspend or may revoke the license of any geologist licensed under the Act who has violated the Code, including a State official or employee performing his or her assigned duties.
   However, a State official or employee who loses his license for violations of the Code is still exempt from the provisions of the Act, and thus would not be prevented from practicing geology for the State without a license should the agency decide to retain him.
