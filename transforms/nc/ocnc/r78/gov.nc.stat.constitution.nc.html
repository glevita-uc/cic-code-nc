     History Note.
    </b>
    - Session Laws 1969, c. 1258, proposed a complete editorial revision of the Constitution of North Carolina, to be submitted to the qualified voters of the State at the 1970 general election. The revised Constitution was adopted by vote of the people at the general election held Nov. 3, 1970, to take effect July 1, 1971. In addition to the new Constitution, six other constitutional amendments were submitted to the voters at the 1970 general election, to be voted on independently, and five of these were adopted. The effect of these amendments is indicated in notes under the sections affected.

   <span class="s1">

   19, does not consist simply of the right to be free from arbitrary physical restraint or servitude, but is deemed to embrace the right of man to be free in the enjoyment of the faculties with which he has been endowed by his Creator, subject only to such restraints as are necessary for the common welfare. It includes the right of the citizen to be free to use his faculties in all lawful ways; to live and work where he will; to earn his livelihood by any lawful calling; to pursue any livelihood or vocation, and for that purpose to enter into all contracts which may be proper, necessary and essential to his carrying out these purposes to a successful conclusion.

        "Liberty" Qualified by Common-Law Doctrines.

        Court of appeal erred in reversing a trial court's order denying a board of education summary judgment in a mentally disabled student's action alleging that the board failed to protect him from sexual assault because the student's common law negligence claim was not an adequate remedy at state law when it was entirely precluded by the application of the doctrine of sovereign immunity since although the student had a negligence claim under the common law, that claim was automatically precluded by sovereign immunity due to the language of the board's excess liability insurance policy excluding coverage for negligent acts; constitutional rights should not be determined by the specific language of the liability insurance policies carried by the boards of education in each county.

        Pursuit of Occupation - In General.
   
   - While the legislature, in the exercise of the State police power, may protect the public against incapacity, fraud and oppression by establishing standards of personal fitness and requiring the examination and licensing of those desiring to engage in the learned professions and occupations requiring scientific or technical knowledge or skill, or which involve a trust relationship with the public, it may not impose such restrictions upon those wishing to engage in the ordinary trades or occupations which are harmless in themselves, since the right to choose and pursue a means of livelihood is a property right and a personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution, which right may be interfered with only when necessary to the protection of the public safety or welfare. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 746</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 854, 128 A.L.R. 658 (1940).

       Elections.
   
   - In construing the provisions of the North Carolina Constitution in regard to elections, it should be kept in mind that this is a government of the people in which the will of the people - the majority - legally expressed, must govern, and that these provisions should be liberally construed, that tend to promote a fair election, or expression of this popular will.

       Acts Enacted by General Assembly.
   
   - It is axiomatic that since all political power is derived from the people and all government originates from them, the sovereign power of the people, expressed through their chosen representatives in the General Assembly, is supreme, and a law enacted by them may not be set aside by the courts unless it contravenes some prohibition or mandate of the Constitution by which the people of the State have elected to be limited and restrained, or unless it violates some provision of the granted powers of federal government contained in the Constitution of the United States.

        Judiciary Cannot Strip Legislative Branch of Constitutional Power to Propose Amendments to Constitution.
       </b>
       - Superior court erred in declaring that the members of the General Assembly duly elected in 2016 lacked authority to pass bills proposing amendments to the state constitution for the people's consideration based on the fact that certain members were elected from illegally gerrymandered districts because nothing in the appellate court's jurisprudence suggested that the judiciary could unilaterally strip the legislative branch of some of its constitutional powers. It was simply beyond the appellate court's power to thwart the otherwise lawful exercise of constitutional power by the legislative branch to pass bills proposing amendments; thus, the challenged constitutional amendments duly ratified by the people were valid.

       <p>
        Principle Stated.
   
   - This section embodies succinctly the judgment of the people of North Carolina in regard to the principle of the separation of powers. Long v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 99</cite>, 110 S.E. 765, 22 A.L.R. 277 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        The principle of separation of powers was clearly in the minds of the framers of the Constitution; and the people of North Carolina, by specifically including a separation of powers provision in the original Constitution adopted in 1776, and readopting the provision in 1868 and 1970, are firmly and explicitly committed to the principle. In re Powers, 295 S.E.2d 589 (N.C. 1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Functions Separate.
   
   - Each of the coordinate departments has its appropriate functions, and one cannot control the action of the other in the sphere of its constitutional power and duty. State v. Holden, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 829</cite> (1870); Person v. Board of State Tax Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 499</cite>, 115 S.E. 336 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Classification of Departments Is Not Exact.
   
   - Although the State is firmly committed to the doctrine of separation of powers, the classification cannot be very exact, and there are many officers whose duties cannot be exclusively arranged under the duties of either of the judicial, legislative or executive heads. Jernigan v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 556</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 259 (1971).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointment of Executive Officers.
   
   - Senatorial confirmation of the members of the Governor's Cabinet does not violate the separation of powers clause when the Governor retains the power to nominate them, has strong supervisory authority over them, and has the power to remove them at will. The Governor's power to nominate is significant, and the ultimate appointee will be a person that he alone has chosen, subject only to an up-or-down vote by the Senate. The Governor's supervisory and removal powers, moreover, ensure that the Governor retains ample post-appointment control over how his Cabinet members perform their duties. As a result, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143B.html#t143Ba01s143B-9ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 143B-9(a)</a></cite>'s senatorial confirmation requirement leaves the Governor with enough control to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and therefore does not violate the Separation of Powers Clause. Cooper v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 799</cite>, 822 S.E.2d 286 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The independence of the Supreme Court
   
   only, and not of the entire judicial department, is provided for by this section. But there is nothing which gives the Supreme Court supervisory control over the legislature. Walser ex rel. Wilson v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 683</cite>, 33 S.E. 139 (1899).
   <br />
       </p>

        Constitution Shields Judicial Branch from Legislative Interference So Far as Its Inherent Rights and Powers.
   
   - Pursuant to N.C. Const., Art. I,

    §
   </span>
   6 and N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1, the North Carolina Constitution shields the judicial branch from legislative interference, so far at least as its inherent rights and powers are concerned. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Court Practice Regulated by Judiciary.
   
   - Under the Constitution, as the supreme judicial power is independent of the other departments, the legislature cannot prescribe rules of practice for the Supreme Court; nevertheless, the courts have copied, almost verbatim, the provisions of the Code. Herndon v. Imperial Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 384</cite>, 16 S.E. 465 (1892); Bird v. Gilliam, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 76</cite>, 34 S.E. 196 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is conflict between the rules of practice prescribed by the legislature and the rules made by the Supreme Court, the rules made by the court will be observed. Cooper v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 615</cite>, 113 S.E. 569 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court has the sole right to prescribe rules of practice and procedure therein. Lee v. Baird, <cite class="nc_code">146 N.C. 361</cite>, 59 S.E. 876 (1907); State v. Furmage, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 616</cite>, 109 S.E.2d 563 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rules prescribed by the Supreme Court to regulate its own procedure, including the rule as to dismissing an appeal thereto if not docketed, or a recordari prayed for in apt time, will be strictly enforced. Being under the exclusive authority therein given to the Supreme Court by this section, a statute in conflict therewith will not be observed. State v. Ward, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 618</cite>, 113 S.E. 775 (1922).

   - The principle that when the jurisdiction of a particular court is constitutionally defined the legislature cannot by statute restrict or enlarge that jurisdiction unless it is authorized to do so by the Constitution is grounded on the separation of powers provisions found in many American Constitutions, including the Constitution of this State. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).

         Judiciary Cannot Strip Legislative Branch of Constitutional Power to Propose Amendments to Constitution.
        </b>
        - Superior court erred in declaring that the members of the General Assembly duly elected in 2016 lacked authority to pass bills proposing amendments to the state constitution for the people's consideration based on the fact that certain members were elected from illegally gerrymandered districts because nothing in the appellate court's jurisprudence suggested that the judiciary could unilaterally strip the legislative branch of some of its constitutional powers. It was simply beyond the appellate court's power to thwart the otherwise lawful exercise of constitutional power by the legislative branch to pass bills proposing amendments; thus, the challenged constitutional amendments duly ratified by the people were valid.

        Judiciary Could Not Order Judgment Be Paid from State Treasury.
   
   - Although the State of North Carolina violated a provision in the North Carolina Constitution when it moved money otherwise destined for county schools to a separate state fund to pay for county jail programs, a trial court could not command state officials to pay money from the State of North Carolina's treasury to satisfy the court judgment against the State, because the Separation of Powers Clause in the Constitution prevented the courts from stepping into the shoes of the other branches of government and assuming their constitutional duties.

        The legislature may constitutionally provide for a "de novo" review of the quasi-judicial decision of an agency;
   
   therefore, review of a civil service board's decision by the superior court under the "de novo" standard did not violate this section nor impermissibly allow the judicial branch to substitute its judgment for that of the city manager on a personnel matter where the question before the superior court was not whether the employee should have been terminated rather than demoted, suspended, or transferred, but whether the action of the employee's supervisor was "justified."

        Court's Proper Exercise of Jurisdiction.

        There was no violation of the Separation of Powers Clause when the district court, exercising its exclusive, original jurisdiction, issued the order for a juvenile sex offender's commitment and the order denying the juvenile's conditional release as requested by Division of Youth Services, both of which included dispositional directives regarding the juvenile's needs for specialized sexual offender treatment.

        Judicial Function in Criminal Cases.
   
   - The function of the court in regard to the punishment of crimes is to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, and if that determination is one of guilt, then to pronounce the punishment or penalty prescribed by law.

        Habeas Relief Did Not Violate Separation of Powers Doctrine.

        Amendment of Judicially Imposed Criminal Sentences by Corrections Department.
   
   - The legislative, executive, and supreme judicial powers of the State government are separate and distinct from each other; therefore, by independently amending sentences imposed by trial courts to reflect compliance with its interpretation of statutory authority, the Corrections Department usurped the power of the judiciary and violated the separation of powers doctrine. Hamilton v. Freeman, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 195, 554 S.E.2d 856 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 285</cite>, 560 S.E.2d 802 (2002).

        Habitual Offender Act Not Violative of Separation of Powers Clause.

        Legislature May Establish Parole System.
   
   - In the division of governmental authority, the legislature has exclusive power to determine the penological system of the State. It alone can prescribe the punishment for crime. It may therefore establish a parole system. Jernigan v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 556</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 259 (1971).

        Appointment of Executive Officers.
   
   - When executive officers appointed by the General Assembly form a majority on a commission that has the final say on how to execute the laws the General Assembly, not the Governor, can exert most of the control over the executive policy that is implemented; the Governor cannot take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and the separation of powers clause does not allow the General Assembly to take this much control over the execution of the laws from the Governor and lodge it with itself. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).
       </p>

        Supreme Court of North Carolina concludes that the relevant provisions of N.C. Sess. Laws 2017-6, when considered as a unified whole, leave the Governor with little control over the views and priorities of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement by requiring that a sufficient number of its members to block the implementation of the Governor's policy preferences be selected from a list of nominees chosen by the leader of the political party other than the one to which the Governor belongs, limiting the extent to which individuals supportive of the Governor's policy preferences have the ability to supervise the activities of the Bipartisan State Board, and significantly constraining the Governor's ability to remove members of the Bipartisan State Board.

         II. DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In General.
   
   - The legislature may not abdicate its power to make laws nor delegate its supreme legislative power to any other coordinate branch or to any agency which it may create. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970); Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970); Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of this section and N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1 is to elucidate the circumstances in which delegation of legislative powers is permissible. Heritage Village Church &amp; Missionary Fellowship, Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 253 S.E.2d 473 (1979), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 399</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 726 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation to Municipalities.
   
   - Ordinary restrictions with respect to the delegation of power to an agency of the State, which exercises no function of government, do not apply to cities, towns or counties. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation to Administrative Bodies.
   
   - As to some specific subject matter, the legislature may delegate a limited portion of its legislative power to an administrative agency if it prescribes the standards under which the agency is to exercise the delegated powers. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        A modern legislature must be able to delegate, in proper instances, a limited portion of its legislative powers to administrative bodies which are equipped to adapt legislation to complex conditions involving numerous details with which the legislature cannot deal directly. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The principle that the General Assembly may not delegate its power to any other department or body, is not absolute. Since legislation must often be adapted to complex conditions involving numerous details with which the legislature cannot deal directly, the constitutional prohibition against delegating legislative authority does not deny to the legislature the necessary flexibility of enabling it to lay down policies and establish standards, while leaving to designated governmental agencies and administrative boards the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the legislature shall apply. A-S-P Assocs. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 207</cite>, 258 S.E.2d 444 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        By providing adequate guidelines for rules review, the General Assembly has ensured that the North Carolina Rules Review Commission's authority as it relates to the rules promulgated by the North Carolina State Board of Education is not "arbitrary and unreasoned" and is sufficiently defined to maintain the separation of powers required by the State Constitution. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Review and approval authority delegated to the North Carolina Rules Review Commission is an appropriate delegable power, and the General Assembly has adequately directed the Commission's review of the North Carolina State Board of Education proposed rules and limited the role of the Commission to evaluating those proposed rules to ensure compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessity for Adequate Standards When Delegating Power.
   
   - As to some specific subject matter, the legislature may delegate a limited portion of its legislative power to an administrative agency if it prescribes the standards under which the agency is to exercise the delegated powers. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional inhibition against delegating legislative authority does not preclude the legislature from transferring adjudicative and rule-making powers to administrative bodies, provided such transfers are accompanied by adequate guiding standards to govern the exercise of the delegated powers. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        When there is an obvious need for expertise in the achievement of legislative goals, the General Assembly is not required to lay down a detailed agenda covering every conceivable problem which might arise in the implementation of the legislation. It is enough if general policies and standards have been articulated which are sufficient to provide direction to an administrative body possessing the expertise to adapt the legislative goals to varying circumstances. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test of constitutional delegation of legislative power is whether the delegation is accompanied by adequate guiding standards; if so, the delegation will be upheld. In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The General Assembly must prescribe the standard for an administrative board with sufficient definiteness so that the board is bound by legislative policy and cannot, under the name of finding facts, actually set policy. Farlow v. North Carolina State Bd. of Chiropractic Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 332 S.E.2d 696, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 664</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 621 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of Adequate Guiding Standards Test.
   
   - The purpose of the adequate guiding standards test is to reconcile the legislative need to delegate authority with the constitutional mandate that the legislature retain in its own hands the supreme legislative power. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978). See also, In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of Test.
   
   - The key to an intelligent application of the adequate guiding standards test is an understanding that, while delegations of power to administrative agencies are necessary, such transfers of power should be closely monitored to insure that the decision making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned and that the agency is not asked to make important policy choices which might just as easily be made by the elected representatives in the legislature. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Specificity of Legislative Goals.
   
   - Goals and policies set forth by legislature for an agency to apply in exercising its powers need be only as specific as the circumstances permit. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978); In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedural Safeguards.
   
   - In determining whether a particular delegation of authority is supported by adequate guiding standards, it is permissible to consider whether the authority vested in the agency is subject to procedural safeguards. A key purpose of the adequate guiding standards test is to insure that the decision making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978). See also In re Broad &amp; Gales Creek Community Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 267</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 645 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedural safeguards tend to encourage adherence to legislative standards by the agency to which power has been delegated. The presence or absence of procedural safeguards is relevant to the broader question of whether a delegation of authority is accompanied by adequate guiding standards. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />

       </p>
       <p>
        Statute authorizing the Industrial Commission to award compensation for bodily disfigurement is not unconstitutional as a void delegation of legislative power in contravention of this section. Baxter v. W.H. Arthur Co., <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 276</cite>, 4 S.E.2d 621 (1939).

        The Coastal Area Management Act of 1974 (G.S. 113A-100 et seq.) properly delegates authority to the Coastal Resources Commission to develop, adopt and amend State guidelines for the coastal area.

        This section does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power, where the statute authorizes the Board of Law Examiners to make rules governing admission to the bar to "promote the welfare of the State and the profession," and a person who was not allowed to take the bar exam because her law school was not ABA accredited contended that the Board was not given adequate standards to guide its actions.

         Delay of Rules by Review Commission.
        </b>
        - An act vesting in the Administrative Rules Review Commission (ARRC), a commission appointed by the General Assembly, the power to delay indefinitely the effective date of duly adopted agency rules which it deems in excess of statutory authority would likely be held to violate this section by vesting the ARRC with judicial powers reserved to the court and with supreme legislative powers reserved to the General Assembly. See opinion of Attorney General to Henson P. Barnes, President Pro Tempore, Senate, 60 N.C.A.G. 70 (1991).

       - General Assembly provided public notice and access to the fourth extra session and no official deliberations occurred in secret; thus, the lower court properly rejected plaintiffs' challenge that, because they received no advance notice of the legislative topics to be introduced in the session, and the bills introduced were debated and enacted in less than 48 hours, plaintiffs were denied the meaningful opportunity to inform their representatives about legislation; their substantive and procedural due process claims also failed.

       Ballot Access Rules Held Constitutional.
   
   - While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation, it also found that associational rights were not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly and unmistakably appeared beyond a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a09s163-96ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 163-96(a)(2)</a></cite> was not violative of N.C.

   12, 14, and 19 because the requirements did not severely burden associational rights, as: (1) minority parties seeking recognition had over three and one-half years to obtain the required signatures; (2) statute put few restrictions on signatories, since signatories did not have to register with or promise to vote for candidates of the party seeking recognition, and could vote in a major party's primary; (3) handful of supporters could obtain the required signatures; and (4) requirements were readily achievable.

       Complaint Satisfied Causation Elements of Constitutional Claim.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting an employer's motion to dismiss on the theory that an employee did not adequately plead the causation element of her constitutional claims because the complaint included allegations sufficient to satisfy the pleading requirements regarding the causation elements of her constitutional claims; the employee alleged she was terminated for speaking out against unlawful practices and that the adverse action was in retaliation for her exercise of her constitutional rights.

        Right to Instruct Clause.
       </b>
       - North Carolina Court of Appeals rejects the claim that the N.C. Constitution permits courts to dictate how much time the General Assembly must spend contemplating legislative action; the framers left to the judgment of the legislative branch how quickly to move a bill through the law-making process. The Right to Instruct Clause, does not change that and simply requires that the process, however quickly it moves, must be open to the public and people must have ways to contact their representatives to convey their views during that process. Common Cause v. Forest, - N.C. App.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 668 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Words in the Right to Instruct Clause reflect a right of the people to teach or advise their representatives, not to bind them; the Right to Instruct protects the ability of the people to contact their elected representatives and convey their views about the decisions those representatives are tasked with making on their behalf.

       Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over Ecclesiastical Matter.
   
   - Trial court erred in denying parish council members' motion to dismiss church members' action because the claims could not be adjudicated in the judicial system since the church members raised questions that went far beyond the consideration of "neutral principles of law" and would require the court to interpret or weigh church doctrine; the allegations were focused upon the actual governance of the church and the church members' right to participate fully in the church.

       Secular Neutrality Mandated.
   
   - Construed together, this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19 and U.S. Const., Amend. I may be said to coalesce into a singular guarantee of freedom of religious profession and worship, as well as an equally firmly established separation of church and state. The legislature oversteps the bounds of this separation when it enacts a regulatory scheme which, whether in purpose, substantive effect, or administrative procedure, tends to "control or interfere" with religious affairs, or to "discriminate" along religious lines, or to constitute a law "respecting" the establishment of religion. Stated simply, the constitutional mandate is one of secular neutrality toward religion. Heritage Village Church &amp; Missionary Fellowship, Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 399</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 726 (1980).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This Section Protects Freedom to Exercise One's Religion.
   
   - The term "rights of conscience," as used in this section, must be construed in relation to the right to worship God according to the dictates of one's own conscience. Consequently, the freedom protected by this provision is no more extensive than the freedom to exercise one's religion, which is protected by U.S. Const., Amend. I. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It Does Not Protect One's Sense of Ethics.
   
   - This constitutional provision does not provide immunity for every act which one's conscience permits him to do, or even for every act which one's conscience classifies as required by ethics, nor shield the defendant from a command by the State that he do an act merely because he believes it morally or ethically wrong. It is the right to exercise one's religion, or lack of it, which is protected, not one's sense of ethics. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Protection Not Limited to Clergymen and Organized Religious Groups.
   
   - The freedoms protected by this constitutional provision are not limited to clergymen. Indeed, they are not limited to members of an organized religious body, and consequently are not contingent upon proof that others share the views of the individual who asserts his own constitutional right to the freedom to exercise his religion or "right of conscience." In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unorthodox Religious Beliefs Are Protected.
   
   - This constitutional provision extends its protection to the unorthodox, unusual and unreasonable belief as truly as to the belief shared by many. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       But freedom to exercise one's religious beliefs is not absolute.
   
   In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).

      <p>
       Use of drugs may be prohibited
   
   notwithstanding the user's asserted belief that such use is required by Divine Law. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Religious Freedom Is Impaired by Governmental Compulsion of That Which Religious Belief Forbids.
   
   - The free exercise of religion is impaired not only by the governmental prohibition of that which one's religious belief demands, but also by governmental compulsion of that which one's religious belief forbids. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Government May Not Force One to Act Contrary to Religious Belief in Absence of "Compelling State Interest".
   
   - The liberty secured by U.S. Const., Amend. I and by this section is so basic and fundamental that one may not be compelled by governmental action to do that which is contrary to his religious belief in the absence of a "compelling State interest in the regulation of a subject within the State's constitutional power to regulate." In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effective operation of courts of justice is a "compelling State interest."
   
   In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Overrides Belief of Witness Who Refuses to Testify for Religious Reasons.
   
   - The "compelling interest" of the State in the rendering of a just judgment in accordance with its law overrides the incidental infringement upon the religious belief of a witness that for him to testify is wrong. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The State has a compelling interest that a person called as a witness should be sworn and should testify in the administration of justice between the State and one charged with a serious offense, and therefore a minister called as a witness in such prosecution may be held in contempt of court upon his refusal to be sworn as a witness, notwithstanding his assertion that his refusal is a matter of religious conscience. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 68</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 317, cert. denied, 388 U.S. 918, 87 S. Ct. 2137, 18 L. Ed. 2d 1362 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Counsel may not attack credibility of a witness because of the witness's religious beliefs
   
   or rights of conscience. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 320</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 669 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prosecutor's argument as to defendant's credibility held not to violate this section
   
   or <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rules 603 or 610, despite an indirect reference to defendant's affirmation as a witness. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 320</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 669 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The legal tribunals of the State have no jurisdiction over purely ecclesiastical questions
   
   and controversies, for there is a constitutional guarantee of freedom of religious profession and worship, as well as an equally firmly established separation of church and State, but the courts do have jurisdiction as to civil, contract and property rights which are involved in, or arise from, a church controversy. Reid v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 201</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 114 (1954); Atkins v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 198 S.E.2d 101, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 306</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 641 (1973); African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church v. Union Chapel A.M.E. Zion Church, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 391, 308 S.E.2d 73 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 308</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 649 (1984).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Civil Court's Jurisdiction Over Church's Termination of Members.
   
   - While a court did not have jurisdiction to consider ecclesiastical matters in a church's governance of its membership, such as whether the grounds in a termination letter to two church members were accurate and whether the termination was conducted in a fair and reasonable manner and in good faith, the two terminated members had a property interest in their membership, and the court could consider whether the church's bylaws were properly adopted and followed by the church in the termination of the members. Tubiolo v. Abundant Life Church, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 324, 605 S.E.2d 161 (2004), cert. denied, - U.S.

       How Civil Courts Must Decide Church Property Disputes.
   
   - Civil courts must decide church property disputes without inquiring into underlying controversies over religious doctrines and without in any way basing their decisions upon any determination made upon such an inquiry. Atkins v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 198 S.E.2d 101, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 306</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 641 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appellate court erred in dismissing the pastor's appeal of the trial court's denial of the pastor's motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought against the pastor, secretary, and board chairman over whether they were diverting church funds because no neutral principles of law existed to resolve the church members' claims that the pastor, secretary, and board chairman were making improper use of the funds, the courts had to defer to the church's internal governing body, the Council for Ministry, to avoid becoming impermissibly entangled in the dispute, in violation of the First Amendment and the North Carolina Constitution. Harris v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 265</cite>, 643 S.E.2d 566 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       In a child custody proceeding, the court cannot base its findings on the preferability of any particular faith
   
   or religious instruction. Dean v. Dean, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 232 S.E.2d 470 (1977).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Spiritual welfare of a child is a factor that may be considered
   
   by the trial court in making a custody determination. Dean v. Dean, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 232 S.E.2d 470 (1977).

       Biological Parents' Rights Outweighed Adoptive Parents' Rights.
   
   - Biological parents constitutionally-protected paramount right to custody, care, and control of their child, including control over his associations, outweighed adoptive parents' interests, including their right to freedom of religion; therefore, inquiry into plaintiffs' religious beliefs, if error, was harmless. Petersen v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 397</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 901 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A law requiring the observance of Sunday as a day of rest and relaxation
   
   does not cease to be a reasonable exercise of the police power of the State, merely because it is in harmony with the religious beliefs of most Christian denominations. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The choice of Sunday by the legislature as a day of rest and relaxation does not render statute unconstitutional, as a law establishing a religion or interfering with freedom of worship, merely because other persons are required by their religious convictions to rest from their labors on a different day of the week, or because, having no religious convictions, they consider Sunday as an exceptionally promising day for business. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section do not deprive the legislature of authority to prohibit by a statute, otherwise valid, the carrying on of and engaging in, on Sunday, any and all labor and the operation of industrial and commercial pursuits, except for works of necessity and acts which, themselves, are in exercise of the constitutional right to worship. Moreover, the legislature may delegate this power to municipalities. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Ordinance prohibiting certain activities on Sunday held not in contravention of this section. State v. McGee, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 633</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 783, appeal dismissed, 346 U.S. 802, 74 S. Ct. 50, 98 L. Ed. 334, reh'g denied, 346 U.S. 918, 74 S. Ct. 272, 98 L. Ed. 413 (1953).

      <p>
       A municipal ordinance prohibiting the handling of venomous and poisonous reptiles
   
   in such a manner as to endanger the public health, safety and welfare would not be held invalid upon defendants' contention that the ordinance interfered with the exercise of their religious practices. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 734</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 179, appeal dismissed, 336 U.S. 942, 69 S. Ct. 813, 93 L. Ed. 1099, reh'g denied, 336 U.S. 971, 69 S. Ct. 939, 93 L.

        Racial Slur Is Unprotected Speech.

        Use of "Fighting Words" Not Protected.
   
   - District attorney's abusive verbal attack on African-American man which gave rise to the inquiry removing him from office was not protected speech under the First Amendment. Instead, when taken in context, his repeated references to victim as a "nigger" presented a classic case of the use of "fighting words" tending to incite an immediate breach of the peace which are not protected by either the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of North Carolina.

       <p>
        Deputy sheriff's free speech rights were not violated because mutual confidence and loyalty between a sheriff and a deputy were crucial in accomplishing the sheriff's policies and duties; thus, the deputy could be lawfully terminated for political reasons under the exception to prohibited political terminations; by standing in the elected sheriff's shoes, a deputy sheriff fills a role in which loyalty to the elected sheriff is necessary to ensure that the sheriff's policies are carried out.

        Balancing of Freedom of Speech and Press and Right to Fair Trial.
   
   - The framers of the federal and State Constitutions gave no priorities to the fundamental guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press and the guarantee that every criminal defendant shall receive a fair trial, but left to the courts the delicate task of balancing the defendant's constitutionally guaranteed right to a fair trial against the constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

       <p>
        Burden of Justifying "Gag" Rule.
   
   - Even pervasive, adverse publicity does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial, and any prior restraint on expression comes to the courts with a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity; thus, one seeking to impose a "gag" rule carries a heavy burden of showing justification for the imposition of such a rule. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 394</cite>, 284 S.E.2d 437 (1981).

        Newspaper companies were entitled to summary judgment on their action challenging an airport operator's ban on newspaper racks because the ban on the installation of news racks within the terminals substantially burdened the newspaper companies' expressive conduct within that public place, and the operator failed to advance sufficiently powerful interests to justify the burden on protected expression.

        Employee's Right to Free Speech.
   
   - The test of whether speech that allegedly leads to the discharge of an employee involves a matter of public concern is whether the employee was speaking as a citizen about matters of public concern, or as an employee on matters of personal interest.

        1983 against the school board for violation of the administrator's free speech rights under the North Carolina Constitution failed as (1) the administrator's speech involved not only disciplinary practices and the use of a time-out room, but also the administrator's disputes with a supervisor so that the speech was more in the capacity as a public school administrator than as a private citizen; and (2) the school board's interest in maintaining effective functioning of the school by removing the administrative, a disruptive and dividing influence, far outweighed the administrator's interest in First Amendment expression. Love-Lane v. Martin, 201 F. Supp. 2d 566 (M.D.N.C. 2002).

       <p>
        Former at-will employee's claims that alleged that the employee was fired for opposing the employer's unlawful activities, insisting on proper reporting, and demanding the payment of past wages due to employees were dismissed because North Carolina rejected free speech abridgment claims against private sector employers under the North Carolina constitution, which did not recognize a remedy for private sector employees against their employers.

   14 because the activity did not involve a matter of public concern; the employee's argument that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115D.html#t115Da2As115D-28" target="_blank">G.S. 115D-28</a></cite> conferred a per se public concern status on the distribution of salary information because any person who was denied access to the information could compel compliance by obtaining judicial relief was rejected. Even if the employee's activity deserved constitutional protection, qualified immunity would still protect the community college president and the vice-president. Munn-Goins v.

         No Right to Recover Against Employer in Individual Capacity.
        </b>
        - A public employee who suffers retaliation for his protected speech has a cause of action against his employer directly under this section, and even though sovereign immunity does not bar such a suit, the state constitution does not create a right to recovery against a public employer in his individual capacity. Myers v. Town of Landis, 957 F. Supp. 762 (M.D.N.C. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Establishing Claim of Retaliatory Discharge.
   
   - To properly advance a claim that an employee was discharged in retaliation for exercising her free speech rights under the State Constitution, the speech at issue first must involve a matter of public concern, and, second, such protected speech or activity must have been the motivating or "but for" cause for the employee's discharge.

        Discharge of County Sheriff's Deputy and Employee.
   
   - Deputy sheriff was discharged based upon political conduct without violating free speech rights. Dismissal of another employee's claim for violation of the employee's rights to free speech was appropriate because the sheriff produced evidence that the employee was discharged for failure to comply with the sheriff's department rules and policies, and the employee failed to produce specific evidence that the employee's discharge was politically motivated.

        Ballot Access Rules Held Constitutional.
   
   - While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation, it also found that associational rights were not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly and unmistakably appeared beyond a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a09s163-96ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 163-96(a)(2)</a></cite> was not violative of N.C.

   12, 14, and 19 because the requirements did not severely burden associational rights, as: (1) minority parties seeking recognition had over three and one-half years to obtain the required signatures; (2) statute put few restrictions on signatories, since signatories did not have to register with or promise to vote for candidates of the party seeking recognition, and could vote in a major party's primary; (3) handful of supporters could obtain the required signatures; and (4) requirements were readily achievable.

       For purposes of our Constitution, a sound basic education will provide the student with at least: (1) sufficient ability to read, write, and speak English and a sufficient knowledge of fundamental math and physical science to enable the student to function in a complex and rapidly changing society; (2) sufficient fundamental knowledge of geography, history and basic economic and political systems to enable the student to make informed choices regarding personal issues or issues that affect the community, state, and nation; (3) sufficient academic and vocational skills to enable the student to successfully engage in post-secondary education or vocational training; (4) and sufficient academic and social skills to enable the student to compete on an equal basis with others in further formal education or gainful employment.

       When a parent alleged the parent's autistic children were denied rights to a sound basic education due to a school board's (board) failure to remedy the children's harassment by other students, the board's motion to dismiss should have been granted because, while the board could not assert governmental immunity as a defense to an alleged constitutional violation, the constitutional right to a sound basic education had not been interpreted to extend beyond the intellectual function of academics.

      </p>
      <p>
       Alternative Education.
   
   - Considering longstanding precedent affording school officials discretion in administering student disciplinary codes and the state constitutional right to a sound basic education, school officials were required to articulate a reason for denying a student access to alternative education during a long-term suspension.

      Retrospective laws, punishing acts committed before the existence of such laws and by them only declared criminal, are oppressive, unjust, and incompatible with liberty, and therefore no ex post facto law shall be enacted. No law taxing retrospectively sales, purchases, or other acts previously done shall be enacted.

      <p>
       "Ex Post Facto Laws" Defined.
   
   - Whenever a retrospective statute applies to crimes and penalties, it is an ex post facto law. State v. Bond, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. 9</cite> (1856); State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. 76</cite> (1867).
      </p>
      <p>
       An ex post facto law is one which either makes that a crime which was not a crime when the offense was committed or which imposes a heavier sentence than that which was prescribed by law at that time. State v. Broadway, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 598</cite>, 72 S.E. 987 (1911).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Applies Only to Criminal Statutes.
   
   - Constitutional prohibitions of ex post facto legislation apply only to criminal proceedings. Stanback v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 292</cite>, 148 S.E. 313 (1929); North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 277 S.E.2d 827 (1981), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative, Not Judicial Action.
   
   - There is no violation of the ex post facto clause in the Constitution of this State when a judicial decision is applied retroactively, because the clause applies to legislative and not judicial action. A party has no vested right in a decision of this State's Supreme Court. State v. Rivens, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 385</cite>, 261 S.E.2d 867 (1980); State v. Funderburk, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 286 S.E.2d 884 (1982).
      </p>
      <p>
       Retroactive application of the Robbins decision to the inmate's parole eligibility did not violate the constitutional prohibition against ex post facto laws because the Fair Sentencing Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa81As15A-1340.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1340.1</a></cite> to 15A-1340.7 had undergone no substantive change subsequent to the commission of the inmate's crimes. Price v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 571 S.E.2d 247, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 615</cite>, 575 S.E.2d 26 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's allowing defendant to be tried for common law obstruction of justice based on the filing of inaccurate campaign finance disclosure reports did not amount to an ex post facto application of the law because the clause applied to legislative and not judicial action. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 696 S.E.2d 832 (2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Inapplicable to Attorney Disciplinary Proceedings.
   
   - The doctrine of ex post facto laws does not apply to attorney disciplinary proceedings. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 277 S.E.2d 827 (1981), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial Abrogation of Common-Law Criminal Principles.
   
   - Whereas this decision holds that the year and a day rule as formerly utilized in murder prosecutions is no longer part of the common law of the state, to apply this decision abrogating the year and a day rule to permit defendant to be convicted of murder in the present case would, at the very least, permit his conviction upon less evidence than would have been required to convict him of that crime at the time the victim died and would, for that reason, violate the principles preventing the application of ex post facto laws. The judgment against defendant for second degree murder was vacated where defendant did not die within a year and a day of the acts in question; however, under the circumstances of this case, a conviction for involuntary manslaughter was appropriate. State v. Vance, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 613</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 495 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Enhancement of Common Law Charge.
   
   - Trial court's decision to enhance the common law obstruction of justice charge against defendant to make it a felony pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-3ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 14-3(b)</a></cite> was not an ex post facto application of the law. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 696 S.E.2d 832 (2010).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An increase in a criminal penalty by legislative action may not constitutionally be applied retroactively.
   
   State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 431</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 19 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the punishment at the time of the offense was death or life imprisonment in the discretion of the jury, a change by the legislature to death alone would be ex post facto as to offenses committed prior to the change. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 431</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 19 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Any legislation which increases the punishment for a crime between the time the offense was committed and the time a defendant is punished therefor is considered an invalid ex post facto law as applied to that defendant. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 122</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 699 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Nor May An Increase by Judicial Action.
   
   - While the letter of the ex post facto clause is addressed to legislative action, the constitutional ban against the retroactive increase of punishment for a crime applies as well against judicial action having the same effect. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 431</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 19 (1973).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The habitual misdemeanor assault statute does not violate the prohibition on ex post facto laws
   
   in either the United States Constitution, Art. I,

   10, cl. 1, or the North Carolina Constitution, Art. I,

   16, by increasing the penalty for these crimes after the offenses were committed; the statute does not impose punishment for previous crimes, but rather imposes an enhanced punishment for behavior occurring after the enactment of the statute, because of the repetitive nature of such behavior. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 209, 533 S.E.2d 518 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Timing of Acts and Result of Murder.
   
   - Depriving defendant of the defense of the "year and a day" rule based on the Supreme Court's prospective abrogation of that rule in State v. Vance, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 613</cite>, 403 S.E.2d 495 (1991) violated the prohibition against ex post facto laws where the murderous acts occurred prior to the abrogation and the victim's death occurred after the abrogation but more than a year and a day after the murderous acts. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 146</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 125 (1993).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Application of felony murder rule in automobile accident did not violate
   
   prohibition against ex post facto laws. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 448, 516 S.E.2d 405 (1999), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, and remanded, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 159</cite>, 538 S.E.2d 917 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A retrospective statute is not necessarily void.
   
   Tabor v. Ward, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 291</cite> (1880).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Generally, the legislature may validate retrospectively
   
   any proceeding which might have been authorized in advance, even though its act may operate to divest a right of action existing in favor of an individual or subject him to a loss he would otherwise not have incurred. This general rule is subject, however, to some exceptions. Anderson v. Wilkins, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 154</cite>, 55 S.E. 272 (1906).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Although vested rights may not be affected by retroactive laws, contingent interests may be affected
   
   thereby; thus, where there is a voluntary trust estate with the limitation over upon a contingent determinable at some future time as to the persons who take thereunder, the power of revocation of the trust given by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.039.html#t39a01s39-6" target="_blank">G.S. 39-6</a></cite> is not objectionable as falling within the constitutional inhibition. Stanback v. Citizens Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 292</cite>, 148 S.E. 313 (1929).
   <br />

   which required respondent to bear the burden of proof to show that he was no longer dangerous or mentally ill and opened the hearing to the public, were procedural changes that did not violate substantive rights or protections though they could have disadvantaged respondent. Therefore, there was no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In re Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 384, 432 S.E.2d 862, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 173</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 376 (1993).

       Use of Adjudication of Juvenile Delinquency Permitted.
   
   - Defendant's contention that use of an adjudication of juvenile delinquency as an aggravating factor in sentencing an adult defendant violates the ex post facto provisions of our state and federal constitutions was unfounded. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 496 S.E.2d 811 (1998), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 76</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 884 (1998), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 219</cite>, 504 S.E.2d 785 (1998).
      </p>
      <p>
       Allowing the State to submit defendant's adjudication of delinquency as an aggravating circumstance at sentencing in his capital murder trial did not violate the prohibition against ex post facto laws; the enhanced sentence was not to be viewed as either a new jeopardy or additional penalty for the earlier crime since it was a stiffened penalty for the latest crime, which was considered to be an aggravated offense because a repetitive one. State v. Wiley, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 592</cite>, 565 S.E.2d 22 (2002).

       Violent Habitual Felony Offender Statute

       Town Ordinance Did Not Violate Ex Post Facto Clause.

   130.03, which prohibited registered sex offenders from knowingly entering any public park owned and operated by a town, did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause since: (1) the town meeting minutes revealed a non-punitive intention to maintain the parks for the enjoyment and safety of the people of the town; (2) a sex offender's claim that the ordinance banished the offender from public spaces was rejected; (3) the ordinance was not deemed punitive merely because it was not narrowly tailored since restrictions on a person's activities could be imposed without being punitive; and (4) the ordinance did not subject registered sex offenders to affirmative disability or restraint since they could still travel freely and attend to their daily functions.

        Because the Open Courts Clause of N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

        Waiver of Rights.
   
   - While every reasonable presumption will be indulged against a waiver of fundamental constitutional rights by a defendant in a criminal prosecution, a defendant may waive the benefit of constitutional guarantees by express consent, by failure to assert them in apt time, or by conduct inconsistent with a purpose to insist upon them.

        Right to Present a Defense.
   
   - Trial court erred by excluding the testimony of three character witnesses pertaining to the victim's past specific instances of violent conduct because the testimony was permitted under this section as defendant claimed he acted in self-defense, and the exclusion of the evidence denied defendant his constitutional right to present a complete defense. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 802 S.E.2d 477 (2017), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 535</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 322 (2018).

        Waiver by Arbitration.
   
   - An agreement to arbitrate a dispute is not an unenforceable contract requiring waiver of a jury; thus, the trial court erred in concluding that because arbitration provision did not provide for trial of facts by a jury that it was unconscionable and unenforceable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.022B.html#t22Ba02s22B-10" target="_blank">G.S. 22B-10</a></cite>, and in violation of N.C.

        Indictment, Arraignment and Trial on Same Day.
   
   - Defendant's indictment, arraignment, and trial on the same day on a burglary charge was not such a flagrant violation of his due process rights that the court was required to dismiss the burglary indictment, since defendant, by not contesting indictments for armed robbery, larceny, and rape, conceded that he had been given sufficient time in which to prepare a defense on such charges; the burglary indictment arose out of the same series of events which led to the three other indictments; the offenses took place at such close proximity in time that any defense which counsel might have prepared to the charge of burglary could not have significantly differed from the defenses he prepared to the charges of larceny, armed robbery, and rape; and any proof of the nonexistence of the essential elements of burglary would necessarily be included in defendant's defense on the other charges in this case, because for each charge defendant would seek to disprove the State's evidence of the sequence of events leading up to the charge, which facts also supported the burglary indictment.

        Use of Closed Circuit Television Held Adequate to Allow Defendant to Confront Child Victim.
   
   - Where, in prosecution for taking indecent liberties with a four-year-old child, during voir dire hearing as to victim's competency as a witness, defendant, although absent from the courtroom, was able to hear all testimony, interact freely with his attorney, and through his attorney confront the victim, thereby accomplishing effective cross-examination, the exclusion of defendant did not violate N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   18, 19 or 23, as the trial court's use of a closed circuit television and its act of providing defendant and his attorney adequate opportunity to communicate during the victim's testimony were sufficient to permit defendant to hear the evidence and to refute it.

        Prosecutor's Conflict of Interest.
   
   - A prosecutor may not be disqualified from prosecuting a criminal action in this State unless and until the trial court determines that an actual conflict of interests exists. In this context, an "actual conflict of interests" is demonstrated where a district attorney or a member of his or her staff has previously represented the defendant with regard to the charges to be prosecuted and, as a result of that former attorney-client relationship, the prosecution has obtained confidential information which may be used to the defendant's detriment at trial. Any order of disqualification ordinarily should be directed only to individual prosecutors who have been exposed to such information. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

       <p>
        District Attorney's Abuse of Calendaring Authority Unconstitutional.
   
   - Where the district attorney placed a large number of cases on the printed trial calendar knowing that all of the cases would not be called, thereby providing defendants virtually no notice of which cases were actually going to be called for trial, a tactic often employed by the district attorney in an attempt to surprise criminal defense counsel, the allegations were sufficient to state a claim that the statutes which grant the district attorney calendaring authority were being applied in an unconstitutional manner in the Fourteenth Prosecutorial District. Simeon v. Hardin, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 358</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 858 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Conversations.
   
   - Where the record established that the substance of a conversation between a juror and the court related to the juror's having "overheard something about the case," where the court excused the juror, and to insure that "no one should be suspicious" about his ability to be fair and impartial, this juror was removed from the case prior to deliberations, and where no other juror indicated that he or she had overheard anything about the case, the conversation between the court and the juror could not have influenced the verdict. State v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 105</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 235 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Instruction.
   
   - Pattern jury instruction used by trial court was internally consistent and meaningful, and did not misuse the term "extenuating," nor define the term "mitigating circumstance" in such a way as to confuse jurors or violate the defendant's due process and fundamental fairness rights. State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 518</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 131 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1164, 120 S. Ct. 1181, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (2000).

         No Private Cause of Action for Deprivation of Speedy Trial Rights.

        - Consistent with federal case law, the court declines to recognize a private cause of action in connection with the deprivation of the right to a speedy trial as guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution; since plaintiff appealed only the dismissal of his direct constitutional claim, he placed before the court no right to relief which the trial court could have recognized.

   - The "remedy" constitutionally guaranteed "for an injury done" is qualified by the words "by due course of law."

The legislature has the power to define the circumstances under which a remedy is legally cognizable and those under which it is not. Lamb v. Wedgewood S.

   - This section guarantees access to the courts to those who have claims, but it does not in all cases forbid the General Assembly from defining or abolishing claims which arise under the common law.

        Relation to Declaratory Judgment Actions.
   
   - Although the North Carolina Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-253" target="_blank">G.S. 1-253</a></cite> to 1-267, empowers a trial court to decline a request for declaratory relief under certain circumstances, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-257" target="_blank">G.S. 1-257</a></cite>
   should not be applied to thwart a properly presented constitutional challenge; the North Carolina courts are obligated to protect fundamental rights when those rights are threatened, and to that end, every person for an injury done him in his lands, goods, person, or reputation shall have remedy by due course of law. Therefore, where it clearly appears either that property or fundamental human rights are denied in violation of constitutional guarantees, and where a statutory provision is specifically challenged by a person directly affected by it, declaratory relief as to the constitutional validity of that provision is appropriate; in other words, when the requested declaration satisfies the recognized criteria, the trial court has no discretion to decline the request. Augur v. Augur, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 582</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 125 (2002).

        Error In Dismissing Case for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction.
   
   - Business court erred in dismissing a cable company's case against a town for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because there existed a justiciable controversy; the controversy arose from the parties' failure to reach an agreement regarding pole attachment rates within 90 days, and that failure violated the company's right to establish just, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory pole attachment rates within 90 days of a request to negotiate under the Public Utilities Act.

        Word "injury" in the remedy clause of N.C. Constitution's open courts provision means the infringement of a legal right, not necessarily injury in fact or factual harm; the remedy clause should be understood as guaranteeing standing to sue in state courts where a legal right at common law, by statute, or arising under the North Carolina Constitution has been infringed.

        Standing.
   
   - Allegations and evidence presented by the neighbors in regards to the increased traffic, increased water runoff, parking, and safety concerns, as well as the secondary adverse effects on the neighbors' businesses, were sufficient special damages to give standing to the neighbors to challenge, pursuant to G.S. 160A-388(e2), the issuance of a special use permit for the opening of an adult establishment.

        When a person alleges the infringement of a legal right arising under a cause of action at common law, a statute, or the North Carolina Constitution, however, the legal injury itself gives rise to standing; when the legislature exercises its power to create a cause of action under a statute, even where a plaintiff has no factual injury and the action is solely in the public interest, the plaintiff has standing to vindicate the legal right so long as he is in the class of persons on whom the statute confers a cause of action.

        Part of the Disclosure Statute creates a cause of action permitting the candidate targeted by the illegal ad to enforce the regulations by bringing suit and establishing statutory damages he can seek, and the committee in this case complied with the requirements of the statute and clearly fell under the class of persons on whom the statute conferred a cause of action; the candidate against whom the ad was run assigned his interest in the case to his committee.

        Requirement for a direct injury in cases where the plaintiff attacks the validity of a statute under the constitution does not apply here; where the plaintiff has suffered infringement of a legal right arising under a statute that confers on a class of persons including the plaintiff a cause of action, and the plaintiff has satisfied the requirements of the statute, the plaintiff has shown standing under the North Carolina Constitution.

        In the context of standing, N.C.

        Judge's announcement of his ruling in open court could not reasonably be characterized as a hearing,

Att'y Gen., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 448, 420 S.E.2d 682, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 168</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 905 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion of Former Attorney Not Warranted.
   
   - In a special proceeding initiated by plaintiffs for the partition of certain land held as a tenancy in common, plaintiffs' former attorney was not subject to being excluded from the courtroom merely because he filed a pleading adverse to plaintiffs' interest after they had terminated his services, especially in light of the fact that the record affirmatively disclosed that he did not represent anyone or take part in or affect the trial in any way. Ingram v. Craven, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 315 S.E.2d 364 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's Warning to Restrict Public Egress Was Proper.
   
   - Where trial judge informed those in the courtroom that he was concerned that the jury would be distracted by movement of spectators in and out of the room, and where he consequently warned them that if they wished to leave the courtroom, they should do so immediately, for they would not be allowed to do so after closing arguments began, barring an emergency, the order was not a denial of a public trial in violation of this section since the judge did not vacate the courtroom nor bar the courtroom door without due warning to those within and without, and since the judge was authorized under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa59s15A-1034ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1034(a)</a></cite> to impose reasonable limitations on access to the courtroom. State v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 146</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 54 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Removal of Spectators from Courtroom was Justified.
   
   - Trial judge did not err in removing four spectators from the courtroom, where the evidence showed, inter alia, that the spectators were talking in the courtroom, in violation of the judge's pretrial order. State v. Dean, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 180, 674 S.E.2d 453 (2009), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 376</cite>, 679 S.E.2d 139 (N.C. 2009).

        The creation of inferior courts by the legislature has been useful
   
   in the administration of justice without "delay" in accordance with this section. Albertson v. Albertson, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E. 352 (1935).

        A motion for a continuance is addressed to the discretion of the trial judge
   
   to be determined by him upon the facts in the exercise of his duty to administer right and justice without sale, denial, or delay. State v. Godwin, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 49</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 347 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delay Caused by Irregular Pleading.
   
   - Under the provisions of this section an adversary party ought not to be delayed in the final adjudication of the controversy by the fact that the exceptions taken by the opposite party are so drawn as to take two chances, first of a favorable decision by the court, and then of a finding in his favor by the jury. Nor ought he to be delayed because the demand for a jury trial fails to point out the precise issue as to which testimony must be offered. Keystone Driller Co. v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 746</cite>, 24 S.E. 517 (1896).

       </p>
       <p>
        Disregarding Attempted Appeal from Nonappealable Order.
   
   - In order to promote the principle set forth in this section, courts may disregard an attempted appeal from a nonappealable interlocutory order and proceed with trial to avoid delay. Veazey v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 357</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 377, reh'g denied, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 744</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 429 (1950).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The denial of a motion for judgment on the pleadings is not immediately appealable,
   
   since otherwise a litigant could delay the administration of justice in contravention of this section. Garrett v. Rose, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 299</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 843 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delay Not Wilful.
   
   - There was no showing that the prosecution wilfully or through neglect or for improper purposes delayed defendant's trial where the delay was due largely to the operation of neutral factors and not to any malevolent intent on the part of the prosecution.

        Delay Not Found.
   
   - Plaintiff offered no evidence to support the claim that the dual role served by the Attorney General's Office both in representing defendant institution and being legal advisor to State Personnel Commission caused actual bias or unfair prejudice to plaintiff, nor that it created any delay in the disposition of her claims.

       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Speedy Trial.
   
   - Every person formally accused of crime is guaranteed a speedy and impartial trial by this section and U.S. Const., Amend. VI and XIV. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prisoners confined for unrelated crimes are entitled to the benefits of the constitutional guaranty of a speedy and impartial trial. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the record was unclear on what happened in the trial court between November 13, 2006 and August 26, 2008, the delay was sufficient to warrant an evidentiary hearing on the issue of defendant's right to a speedy trial. State v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 689 S.E.2d 553 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial does not outlaw good faith delays
   
   which are reasonably necessary for the State to prepare and present its case. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Time Period Involved in Right to Speedy Trial.
   
   - The right to a speedy trial pertains to the time period between the date of the occurrence of the alleged crime and the date when a defendant is "accused" of committing that crime, and an individual becomes "accused" of a crime for the purpose of calculating the length of this delay when he is either arrested or indicted. State v. Salem, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 419, 274 S.E.2d 501, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 401</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 355 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless some fixed time limit is prescribed by statute, speedy trial questions must be resolved on a case-by-case basis.
   
   While all relevant circumstances must be considered, four interrelated factors are of primary significance: (1) the length of delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the extent to which defendant has asserted his right and (4) the extent to which defendant has been prejudiced. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978); State v. Bare, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 335 S.E.2d 748 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 392</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 881 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Undue delay which is arbitrary and oppressive
   
   or the result of deliberate prosecution efforts to hamper the defense violates the constitutional right to a speedy trial. State v. Bare, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 335 S.E.2d 748 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 392</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 881 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Causing Delay Not Denied Speedy Trial.
   
   - A criminal defendant who has caused or acquiesced in a delay will not be permitted to use it as a vehicle in which to escape justice. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Must Be Asserted.
   
   - Failure to assert the right will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy trial. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's failure to assert her speedy trial right sooner in the process did not foreclose her speedy trial claim,
   
   but it did weigh somewhat against her contention that she had been unconstitutionally denied a speedy trial. State v. Webster, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 674</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 349 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden on Defendant.
   
   - The length of a delay is not determinative of whether a violation has occurred; the issue must be resolved on the facts of each case, and the defendant has the burden of establishing that the delay was purposeful or oppressive or by reasonable effort could have been avoided by the State. State v. Bare, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 335 S.E.2d 748 (1985), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 392</cite>, 338 S.E.2d 881 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right is entitled to strong evidentiary weight
   
   in determining whether he is being deprived of such right. State v. Tindall, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 689</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 806 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to a speedy trial
   
   as guaranteed by this section, since delay of two and one-half years was not inordinate, State had a legitimate reason for its delay and defendant showed no prejudice resulting from the delay. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 572, 383 S.E.2d 224 (1989), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 51</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 96 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial, where delay was not the result of prosecutorial willfulness or neglect, and where defendant did not assert his right to a speedy trial until three years after his arrest and failed to show that he was prejudiced by the delay. State v. Lundy, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 13, 519 S.E.2d 73 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss on the grounds that the State violated his constitutional right to a speedy trial where he failed to show that the delay of his second trial was due to the neglect or willfulness of the prosecution, where he failed to assert his right in the five-year interval, and where his claim that the delay resulted in his inability to locate key witnesses was undermined by his failure to call all his witnesses in the first trial. State v. Spinks, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 153, 523 S.E.2d 129 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated, although the length of delay from indictment to trial, was 3 years and 326 days, where: the delay resulted not from willful misconduct but from the appointment of substitute defense counsel and changes in prosecutors; the State only refused to comply with discovery requests by defendant when these concerned evidence or information to which he was not statutorily entitled; and defendant's continual refusal to cooperate in the preparation of his defense resulted in the withdrawal of counsel nearly two years after the indictment. State v. Grooms, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 50</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 713 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 838, 122 S. Ct. 93, 151 L. Ed. 2d 54 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant, whose trial was delayed approximately four and a half years, was not denied his constitutional right under this section where: the local docket was congested with capital cases; the prosecutor's decisions pertaining to scheduling and trial order were not based upon unconstitutional factors, rather the delay was due to neutral factors; the defendant's actions were not consistent with a desire for speedy trial; and although the investigator had died, the State presented other investigators who testified to the same events and observations sought by defendant, and gave the defendant the opportunity to impress upon the jury the absence of the detective best able to testify as to certain events and observations. State v. Hammonds, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 541 S.E.2d 166 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied the right to a speedy trial on a rape conviction, as defendant's excessive post-accusation incarceration before trial was outweighed by defendant's inability to prove neglect or willfulness by the prosecutor combined with a lack of allegation or proof of prejudice. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 581, 570 S.E.2d 898 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 65</cite>, - S.E.2d - (2003), cert. dismissed, - N.C.
   - , 602 S.E.2d 679 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court did not err in affirming the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to dismiss arguing his speedy trial right was violated as application of the four-factor Barker test did not show that the four-year delay between defendant's indictment for the killing of another man and his plea bargain to second-degree murder right before trial was the result of the State's inaction or unreasonableness; rather, the evidence showed that the trial court had a crowded docket regarding murder charges and that defendant was not prejudice by the delay, and thus, denial of the motion to dismiss was not error. State v. Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 114</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 251 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error in denying defendant's motion to dismiss because defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated even though almost two years passed between the date of the offenses and trial; defendant failed to demonstrate actual or substantial prejudice resulting from the delay as he alleged only anxiety and concern, and also failed to meet his burden of showing that the reason for the delay was the neglect or willfulness of the prosecution. State v. Doisey, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 590 S.E.2d 886 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss for denial of a speedy trial, pursuant to his rights under U.S. Const., Amend. VI and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   18, as the 20-month delay was presumptively prejudicial and defendant had asserted his right to a speedy trial, but the reason was attributable to the trial court's case load, which was not due to neglect or willfulness by the State, and to the multiple continuances granted to defendant, and he failed to show that he was prejudiced thereby. State v. Dorton, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 759, 617 S.E.2d 97, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 69</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 775 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   18 and U.S. Const., Amend. VI was not violated because, although a delay of three years and seven months from arrest to trial was exceptionally long, defendant's right to a speedy trial was not impaired as defendant demonstrated no prejudice whatsoever from the delay and he was not incarcerated during the delay; indeed, he moved to another state during the delay. State v. McBride, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 496, 653 S.E.2d 218 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to demonstrate that the dismissal of the driving while impaired charge and subsequent refiling violated his due process or speedy trial rights, because defendant did not assert the right until his appeal from the district court to the superior court and the reasons for the delay were attributable as much to defendant as to the State. State v. Friend, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 338, 724 S.E.2d 85 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to show a violation of defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial under N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   18 because, although the nearly three and one-half year delay between defendant's indictment and his trial was long and defendant's prolonged pre-trial incarceration necessarily caused him hardship, the delay was not caused by the prosecution's neglect or willful misconduct. The evidence tended to show that the changes in defendant's representation caused much of the delay. State v. Kpaeyeh, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 694, 784 S.E.2d 582 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's speedy trial claim failed, because, while the delay of nearly 28 months between defendant's arrest and trial raised a questions of reasonableness, some delay was due to defendant's indecision about counsel, issues regarding communication with counsel, and counsel's scheduling conflicts, and the backlog at the crime lab was a neutral reason for the delay, as defendant failed to show the prosecution or the crime lab underutilized resources available to prepare the case for trial. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 260, 795 S.E.2d 126 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to a speedy trial was not violated despite the 63-month delay, the delay was due to crowded dockets and earlier pending cases, defendant did not assert the right until almost five years after his arrest, and there was no evidence defendant's ability to defend the case was impaired by the delay. State v. Farmer, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 822 S.E.2d 556 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not violated despite the seven-year delay between his arrest and trial; most of the delay was attributable to defendant and he failed to establish that the delay prejudiced his defense. State v. Spinks, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (May 18, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Denied Right to Speedy Trial.
   
   - Where defendant's case did not occur until nearly three years from the date of arrest for trafficking in cocaine by transporting cocaine, and during that time the case was placed on the trial calendar thirty-one times, but never called by the district attorney, and essential witness was no longer available at time of trial, defendant suffered substantial prejudice, and was denied his right to a speedy trial. State v. Chaplin, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 659, 471 S.E.2d 653 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to a speedy trial under the Sixth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   18 was violated where, inter alia, the record showed: (1) that much of the over four-year delay between defendant's arrest and defendant's trial was caused by the State's failure to submit evidence to the State Bureau of Investigation lab to be examined for over three years; (2) that the State's failure to request a comparison of the evidence to a person the State was notified might have been the guilty party; (3) defendant formally asserted defendant's right to a speedy trial more than a year and a half before the trial began; and (4) the delay in bringing defendant to trial prejudiced defendant, as, inter alia, defendant was incarcerated for 366 days prior to trial. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 277, 665 S.E.2d 799 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the State's only evidence to rebut the prima facie showing of a violation of defendant's right to a speedy trial was erroneously admitted in violation of defendant's attorney-client privilege, and without that evidence, the State could not carry its burden of attempting to explain the trial delay, defendant's motion should have been allowed, as the erroneous admission of the State's evidence had a probable impact on a jury finding defendant guilty and the trial court plainly erred in allowing the attorney to testify against his former client. State v. Khalil Abdul Farook, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 20, 2020).

        Balancing the four factors enunciated in Barker v. Wingo,
   
   407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182, 33 L. Ed. 2d. 101 (1972), defendant was not denied the right to a speedy trial and there was no reasonable probability that had counsel advanced a motion to dismiss based on denial of that right, the result of the proceeding would have been different. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 462, 478 S.E.2d 16 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>

        Analysis Required.
   
   - Speedy trial issue was remanded where the trial court had ruled on defendant's pro se motion, but had not considered all of the Barker factors or made appropriate findings. State v. Sheridan, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 824 S.E.2d 146 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was some prejudice to defendant caused by the delay in her trial, the weight of it in the balancing process was diminished
   
   by the absence of any impairment to her defense against the criminal charge and the absence of substantial pretrial incarceration. State v. Webster, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 674</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 349 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Foreign Custody and Absence of Prejudice as Factors in Denying Speedy Trial Violation.
   
   - Defendant was not denied his right to a speedy trial by the delay between his indictment in November, 1977 and his trial in July, 1979, where he was either in federal custody or in custody in South Carolina except from February to September, 1978 and March to July, 1979, and the remaining time fell short of denying defendant his constitutional right to a speedy trial because there was no evidence that any of the delay for which this State was responsible prejudiced his case or his ability to present his defense. State v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 534</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 161 (1980).

        "Liberty".
   
   - The term "liberty," as used in this section, is as extensive as is the same term as used in U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Bulova Watch Co. v. Brand Distrib. of N. Wilkesboro, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 467</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 141 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Property and Liberty Interest in Requiring Agency to Comply with Policies and Procedures.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting judgment on the pleadings in favor of a city because a police officer alleged a valid property and liberty interest in requiring the city to comply with its established promotional process; the officer sufficiently alleged constitutional claims, and genuine issues of material fact remained. Tully v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 204, 790 S.E.2d 854 (2016), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, remanded, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 527</cite>, 810 S.E.2d 208, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 65 (N.C. 2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sovereign Immunity.
   
   - Sovereign immunity was not available as a defense to the claims of temporary employees that were brought directly under the North Carolina Constitution against state agencies and employees. Sanders v. State Pers. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 644 S.E.2d 10 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a sex offender registrant brought claims against state and county officials for wrongfully being required to register, sovereign and governmental immunity did not bar the claims because the claims were asserted under N.C. Const. art. I,

        Federal Decisions Do Not Control Interpretation by North Carolina Supreme Court.
   
   - Decisions by the federal courts as to the construction and effect of the due process clause of the United States Constitution are binding on the North Carolina Supreme Court; however, such decisions, although persuasive, do not control an interpretation by the North Carolina Supreme Court of this section. The North Carolina Supreme Court will therefore make an independent determination of the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs under this section. McNeill v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 552</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 475 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims asserted in the State Court on the basis of the North Carolina Constitution were not identical to the claims asserted by the plaintiff in the Federal Court on the basis of freedom of speech and press under the United States Constitution and dismissal of the state claims on the basis of res judicata was error. Evans v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 181, 468 S.E.2d 575, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 510</cite>, 471 S.E.2d 634, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 177</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 926 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Other State Remedies Must Be Exhausted.
   
   - A state constitutional action is not proper under this section, unless no other state remedy is available; here, an existing state tort remedy precluded plaintiff's assault-based constitutional claim against an arresting officer. Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 538 S.E.2d 601 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Individual's constitutional claims against the sheriff, the sheriff's department, the county, and the detective, based upon the stopping, searching, and detaining of the individual and the retention of his property, were dismissed because the existing common law remedies of false imprisonment, trespass to chattels, and negligence were appropriate alternatives under the facts alleged in the complaint and waiver of governmental immunity was not pleaded. Seaton v. Owens, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Dec. 8, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former employee did not adequately allege a free speech claim, an equal protection claim, and an exclusive emoluments claim when she had an adequate state remedy for those violations because the employee's claim under the Whistleblower Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a14s126-86" target="_blank">G.S. 126-86</a></cite>, was an adequate state law remedy for her alleged free speech violation, her claim of misappropriation of state funds was expressly covered by the Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a14s126-84" target="_blank">G.S. 126-84</a></cite>, and thus was an adequate state law remedy for her exclusive emoluments clause claim; because the employee's equal protection claim alleged discrimination based on activities protected by the Whistleblower Act, it was also precluded. Helm v. Appalachian State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 239, 670 S.E.2d 571 (2008).

       </p>
       <p>
        Due Process Rights Satisfied by Case Hearing Before the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings.
   
   - Where a demoted state employee failed to show that there were actually any similarly situated persons who were treated differently and he did not argue that any difference in discipline was based on a protected characteristic or was without rational basis, his due process and equal protection arguments failed; the employee's due process rights were satisfied by the opportunity to pursue a contested case hearing before the North Carolina Office of Administrative Hearings.

        Requirement That Taxpayer Reduce His Carryover Losses Not Violative of This Section.
   
   - The requirement that the taxpayer reduce his North Carolina carryover losses by his non-North Carolina income did not result in a sophisticated scheme which belatedly taxed the non-North Carolina income and did not violate either the due process clause of the United States Constitution or the law of the land clause of this section. Aronov v. Secretary of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 132</cite>, 371 S.E.2d 468, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 480</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 860 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1096, 109 S.

        - Motion to dismiss was granted because plaintiff had alleged two intentional tort claims for false arrest and assault and battery, which the court found served to protect the same constitutional rights to be free from improper restraint and excessive force he sought to vindicate with his alternative direct constitutional claim.

         II. DUE PROCESS AND THE "LAW OF THE LAND".
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        "Law of the Land"
   
   - The "law of the land" clause itself means that such legislative acts as profess in themselves directly to punish persons, or to deprive the citizen of his property, without trial before the judicial tribunals, and a decision upon the matter of right, as determined by the laws under which it vested, according to the course, mode and usages of the common law as derived from our forefathers, are not effectually "laws of the land" for those purposes. Hoke v. Henderson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. 1</cite> (1833); State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">110 N.C. 538</cite>, 15 S.E. 261 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "law of the land" means the general law; a law which hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial. The meaning is that every citizen shall hold his life, liberty, property and immunities under the protection of the general rules which govern society. Everything which may pass under the form of an enactment is not, therefore, to be considered the "law of the land." State ex rel. Caldwell v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 425</cite>, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 480</cite>, 28 S.E. 554 (1897); Parish v. East Coast Cedar Co., <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 478</cite>, 45 S.E. 768, 98 Am. St. R. 718 (1903); State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 323</cite>, 84 S.E. 1049 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "law of the land" means the general law, the law which hears before it condemns; which proceeds upon inquiry, and renders judgment only after trial. It means the regular course of the administration of justice through the courts of competent jurisdiction, after the manner of such courts. Procedure must be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and justice. State v. Chesson, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 259</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 563 (1947), writ dismissed, 334 U.S. 806, 68 S. Ct. 1185, 92 L. Ed. 1739 (1948). See also, Eason v. Spence, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 579</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 717 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Law of the land" clause of this section incorporates protections similar to those provided by the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution. State v. Ballenger, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 179, 472 S.E.2d 572 (1996), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 626</cite>, 481 S.E.2d 84, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 817, 118 S. Ct. 68, 139 L. Ed. 2d 29 (1997).

        <b>
         Wrongful Death Claim Precluded Constitutional Claim.
        </b>
        - The court dismissed the plaintiff-decedent's relative's claim that defendants, sheriff's deputies, violated the decedent's and his family's rights to substantive due process guaranteed by Article 1 of the North Carolina Constitution where a wrongful death claim could compensate the plaintiff for the same injuries or death as the state constitutional law claim. Olvera v. Edmundson, 151 F. Supp. 2d 700 (W.D.N.C. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Daughter's Corum claims against a county Division of Social Services for negligence, wrongful death, and denial of due process was dismissed because the daughter had an adequate less intrusive remedy against the state Department of Health and Human Services in the Industrial Commission, as (1) adequacy depended on recovery without regard to the party from whom recovery might be obtained, (2) both claims arose out of the same facts and sought recovery for the same injuries, (3) the daughter was not denied access to the "courthouse doors," and (4) the limited damages available in the Industrial Commission, as compared to damages available in a trial court, resulted from the General Assembly's determination of what recovery was adequate for claims within the Industrial Commission's jurisdiction. Taylor v. Wake Cty., <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 811 S.E.2d 648 (2018), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 569</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 394, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 965 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The "law of the land" requires that the administration of justice be consistent with fundamental principles
   
   of liberty and justice. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requires Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard.
   
   - Among other things, "the law of the land" or "due process of law" imports both notice and the opportunity to be heard before a competent tribunal. Parker v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 225 S.E.2d 632 (1976); Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">41 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 254 S.E.2d 643 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "law of the land" clause contained in this section mandates that a party be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before he or she can be deprived of a legal claim or defense. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. App.</cite> 625, 351 S.E.2d 117 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother's motion regarding custody and child support asked the trial court to enter an order modifying and increasing child support and to instruct the father to pay the ordered support each month without deductions; this notice clearly apprised the father that the hearing would include child support issues, including arrearages, and satisfied due process. Swanson v. Herschel, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 622 S.E.2d 159 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in setting aside a pre-trial order, upon its own motion, prior to entry of an equitable distribution judgment because the order was entered in accordance with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-21ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 50-21(d)</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Civ. P. 16(a), and Guilford County, N.C. Dist. Ct. R. 31.9, the court waited over 18 months before setting aside the order containing the parties' binding stipulations, and the court failed to give either party notice of its intent to set aside the order, N.C.

       <p>
        Restraints Imposed on Police Power by "Law of the Land".
   
   - The "law of the land" imposes flexible restraints on the exercise of the State police power, which are satisfied if the act in question is not unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious and the means selected have a real and substantial relation to the objects sought to be attained. State v. Whitaker, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 352</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 860 (1947), aff'd, 335 U.S. 525, 69 S. Ct. 251, 93 L. Ed. 212 (1949).

        The "law of the land" is equivalent to "due process of law."

        The term "law of the land," as used in this section, is synonymous with "due process of law" as that term is applied under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. In re Smith, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 345 S.E.2d 423 (1986); State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Due process" has a dual significance,
   
   as it pertains to procedure and substantive law. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965); In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In substantive law, due process may be characterized as a standard of reasonableness,
   
   and as such it is a limitation upon the exercise of the police power. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965); In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The traditional substantive due process test
   
   has been that a statute must have a rational relation to a valid State objective. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).

        <b>
         No Substantive Due Process Claim Stated.
        </b>
        - Plaintiffs' substantive due process claim failed to state a claim for numerous reasons; to the extent plaintiffs sought payment under an agreement with a risk-management program provided by the North Carolina School Board's Trust, and claimed that the county school board violated substantive due process in not paying their claim, plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted as the Trust was responsible for determining the merits of and paying any claim. Plaintiffs failed to make any allegation of any egregious or outrageous action on the part of the board for failing to pay plaintiffs and plaintiffs' substantive due process claim failed as a matter of law under rational basis review; and plaintiffs failed to allege the existence of a right that the board violated in failing to pay plaintiffs. Frye v. Brunswick County Bd. of Educ., 612 F. Supp. 2d 694 (E.D.N.C. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no substantive due process right violated in the trial court's decision to affirm the decision of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Public Health, (DHHS) to decertify a corporation as a provider of HIV case management services because the trial court perceived that the corporation's lack of proper progress notes prevented DHHS from being able to accurately account for funds allotted by the Division of Medical Services for the program of public assistance, and given that the problem was evident in all four case managers at the corporation, decertification would ensure that funds provided for public assistance would be protected; the trial court's decision was rationally related to the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.108A.html#t108Aa02s108A-25ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 108A-25(b)</a></cite> goal of providing a program of public assistance, as supported by the trial court's findings of fact, conclusions of law and substantial record evidence, and the corporation did not challenge the validity of any statute or rules but contended that the traditional substantive due process test had to be applied to invalidate the trial court's adjudicatory decision. Bradley-Reid Corp. v. N.C. HHS, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 689 S.E.2d 494 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where a law enforcement officer's certification was suspended for 180 days, there was no substantive due process violation because the time of the suspension did not amount to a shock to the conscious where the officer knowingly and willfully falsified training records; moreover, the suspension was not arbitrary because preserving the credibility of law enforcement was a valid state objective, and the suspension was rationally related to that objective. Krueger v. N.C. Crim. Justice Educ. &amp; Training Stds. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 293, 750 S.E.2d 33 (2013).

        Federal Due Process Decisions Persuasive.
   
   - "Law of the land" is equivalent to the federal Fourteenth Amendment "due process of law," and federal court interpretations of the latter, though not binding, are highly persuasive in construing our own amendment. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 354 S.E.2d 350 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988); State v.

       <p>
        A decision of the Supreme Court of the United States construing the due process clause
   
   of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, although persuasive, does not control an interpretation by the Supreme Court of this State of the "law of the land" clause in this section. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds, State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although the "law of the land" clause in this section is synonymous with U.S. Const., Amend. XIV due process, federal court interpretations of due process, though highly persuasive, are not binding on North Carolina courts. Thus, an independent determination of defendant's constitutional rights under the law of the land provision must be made. Gaston Bd. of Realtors, Inc. v. Harrison, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 306 S.E.2d 809 (1983), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 230</cite>, 316 S.E.2d 59 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Law of the land" is synonymous with "due process of law" under the Fourteenth Amendment, and United States Supreme Court interpretations of the latter, though not binding, are highly persuasive in construing the former. Bentley v. North Carolina Ins. Guar. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 418 S.E.2d 705 (1992); Evans v. Cowan, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 510 S.E.2d 170 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Carolina Law of the Land Clause is generally considered the equivalent of the Due Process Clause and has been interpreted as requiring that neither property nor liberty may be deprived but by the general law; although a decision of the United States Supreme Court construing the Due Process Clause is persuasive in interpreting a claim brought under the North Carolina Law of the Land Clause, it is not controlling. Lorbacher v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. App.</cite> 663, 493 S.E.2d 74 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Carolina Supreme Court would employ a different method for deciding what procedural safeguards are due
   
   under the "law of the land" clause to a person deprived of a protected interest than the United States Supreme Court has proposed for deciding similar questions under the due process clause. Henry v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 474</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 720 (1986).

        Statute Must Serve Legitimate Purpose and Be Rationally Related Thereto.
   
   - For a statute to be within the limits set by the federal due process clause and the North Carolina "law of the land" provision, all that is required is that the statute serve a legitimate purpose of state government and be rationally related to the achievement of that purpose. Shipman v. North Carolina Private Protective Servs. Bd., <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 346 S.E.2d 295, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 509</cite>, 349 S.E.2d 866 (1986).

        DWI seizure statutes were held constitutional
   
   in spite of a "law of the land" challenge, indicating that these statutes have a legitimate objective - keeping impaired drivers and their cars off of the roads - and that the means chosen to further the goals - seizing the cars, even when they belong to people other than the drivers - is directly related to said objective.

        County's Rejection of Low Bid Found Reasonable.
   
   - The county's reasons for rejecting the low bidder's bid to operate a county-owned landfill were reasonable to relation to the government's objective to protect the health and safety of its citizens, and thus, its rejection of the bid was not arbitrary or capricious.

        No Property Right in At-Will Employment.
   
   - The trial court erred in failing to grant summary judgment for defendant-state agency where plaintiff, a county extension director, was an employee at-will with no cognizable property right in his employment and, therefore, barred from bringing a due process claim. McCallum v. North Carolina Coop. Extension Serv. of N.C. State Univ., <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 542 S.E.2d 227, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 452</cite>, 548 S.E.2d 527 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that plaintiff sought to challenge his discharge from state employment under the law of the land clause of the North Carolina constitution, that claim required a property interest, and because plaintiff lacked a property interest in his employment under state law (plaintiff was an employee at will), such a claim failed. Whitesell v. Town of Morrisville, 446 F. Supp. 2d 419 (E.D.N.C. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former employee alleged that he had a property interest in continued employment with the City, as created by the City's policy and adopted by ordinance, and that the City violated his due process rights by failing to provide him certain appeal rights following the termination of his employment; however, the employee remained an at-will employee, and the City did not create a property right in his employment when the City adopted the policy. Because the employee had no enforceable property interest, it was unnecessary to address whether the City followed the procedures in the policy; as with the employee's federal due process claim, the absence of a protected property interest doomed the employee's claim under the state constitution. Roberson v. City of Goldsboro, 564 F. Supp. 2d 526 (E.D.N.C. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of appeals erred by overruling an order granting a city's motion for judgment on the pleadings because the officer did not state a valid claim under the constitution since no property interest was implicated; no authority recognized a property interest in a promotion.

        Right to military retirement pay is not a constitutionally protected "vested property right";
   
   the right to retirement pay is a creature of federal statute, not private contract. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 354 S.E.2d 350 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).

       <p>
        Reclassification of Retirement Pay as Marital Property.
   
   - Defendant's right to his retirement pay was "vested" such that it could be included as marital property under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20(b)</a></cite>, yet his right to this government benefit was never "so far perfected as to permit no statutory interference." Thus the legislature's reclassification of defendant's military retirement pay as marital property violated neither the Constitutional guarantees of due process nor the law of the land. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 354 S.E.2d 350 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).

        Order Requiring Appearance for Depositions Interlocutory and Not Immediately Reviewable.
   
   - Order requiring appellants to appear for depositions during jurisdictional discovery was not immediately appealable because the order did not burden appellants' substantial right to due process since appellants voluntarily submitted the jurisdictional issue to the North Carolina General Court of Justice, and consequently appellants ultimately were bound by the North Carolina courts' determination of personal jurisdiction and immediately were bound to abide by those legal rules governing the procedure to be followed in reaching that determination, including the North Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure; because appellants voluntarily submitted to North Carolina jurisdiction to decide the issue of personal jurisdiction in the action, they were bound to participate in what jurisdictional discovery the trial court orders, and appellants' implicit agreement to abide by the legal rules and presumptions of the North Carolina court system necessarily included the agreement to abide by the rules governing appeal of interlocutory orders.

        Right of Litigant to an Adequate and Fair Hearing.
   
   - The "law of the land" clause embodied in this section guarantees to the litigant in every kind of judicial proceeding the right to an adequate and fair hearing before he can be deprived of his claim or defense by judicial decree. And where the claim or defense turns upon a factual adjudication, the constitutional right of the litigant to an adequate and fair hearing requires that he be apprised of all the evidence received by the court and be given an opportunity to test, explain, or rebut it.

        Right to Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard.
   
   - The essential elements of the "law of the land" are notice and opportunity to be heard or defend, before a competent tribunal, in an orderly proceeding adapted to the nature of the case, which is uniform and regular, and in accord with established rules which do not violate fundamental rights. Eason v. Spence, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 579</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 717 (1950).

        The "law of the land" and "due process of law" provisions of the State and federal Constitutions require notice and an opportunity to be heard before a citizen may be deprived of his property. McMillan v. Robeson County, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 413</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 105 (1964); City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).

       <p>
        As to procedure, due process means notice and an opportunity to be heard and to defend in an orderly proceeding adapted to the nature of the case before a competent and impartial tribunal having jurisdiction of the cause. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965); In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "law of the land" clause embodied in this section guarantees to the litigant in every kind of judicial proceeding the right to an adequate and fair hearing before he can be deprived of his claim or defense by judicial decree; where the claim or defense turns upon a factual adjudication, the constitutional right of the litigant to an adequate and fair hearing requires that he be apprised of all the evidence received by the court and given an opportunity to test, explain, or rebut it. Shepherd v. Shepherd, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 71</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 357 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order that there be a valid adjudication of a party's rights, he must be given notice of the action and an opportunity to assert his defense, and he must be a party to such proceeding. In re Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 151, 185 S.E.2d 323 (1971).

        Both the "law of the land" and due process of law import notice and an opportunity to be heard or defend in a regular proceeding before a competent tribunal. Smith v.

        The defendant, who had defaulted on the original complaint which alleged that she was a resident of this State, was entitled to notice of the plaintiff's subsequent motion to declare that none of her property was exempt by virtue of non-residency and an opportunity to contest the factual allegations as to her non-residency; where she was given neither notice nor an opportunity to be heard, in violation of statutory and constitutional provisions, the order declaring that her property was not exempt was invalid, and she was entitled to relief therefrom pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 60(b)(4).

        Alleged father's due process rights were violated where the trial court precluded him from participating in a hearing on a termination of parental rights hearing after a paternity test indicated that there was a zero possibility that he was the child's father because the presumption established by the paternity test was nevertheless rebuttable.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because a buyer was a good faith purchaser for value, and because the homeowner received constitutionally sufficient notice of the foreclosure sale, the trial court abused its discretion in voiding the order of foreclosure and in canceling the deed to the buyer; the failure to effectuate service was not a material irregularity where the homeowner experienced at least two previous foreclosures on the same property and was familiar with the procedure.

        The notice required by this constitutional provision is the notice inherent in the original process

        Notice and Opportunity to Be Heard.
   
   - The right of a defendant charged with a criminal offense to present to the jury his version of the facts is a fundamental element of due process of law, guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 118</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 277 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1075, 119 S. Ct. 1475, 143 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1999).

        Notice is not a prerequisite to determination of questions of a political nature,
   
   such as the necessity and expediency of a taking, but is only necessary prior to the determination of the issue of just compensation. City of Durham v. Manson, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 204 S.E.2d 41, modified on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 741</cite>, 208 S.E.2d 662 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Opportunity to be Heard.
   
   - The due process clause is not violated by failure to give the owner of property an opportunity to be heard as to the necessity and extent of appropriating his property to public use; but it is essential to due process that the mode of determining the compensation to be paid for the appropriation be such as to afford the owner an opportunity to be heard. City of Randleman v. Hinshaw, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 136</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 902 (1966).

Furthermore, because North Carolina cases provide adequate notice of what constitutes a deadly weapon, defendant has not been deprived of due process. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 448, 516 S.E.2d 405 (1999), aff'd in part, rev'd in part on other grounds, and remanded, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 159</cite>, 538 S.E.2d 917 (2000).

        Court reporter's allegedly poor transcription of murder trial proceedings
   
   did not deny defendant due process where defendant failed to point to any significantly incoherent, inconsistent or senseless language in the transcript, where there was no indication of efforts to work with either the court reporter or the district attorney to attempt to correct them and where there was no suggestion that the transcript could not have been reconstructed if this were truly necessary for a proper understanding of the case on appeal.

        Commitment Proceedings.
   
   - An order for the commitment of a person to a mental hospital is essentially a judgment by which he is deprived of his liberty, and it is a cardinal principle of English jurisprudence that before any judgment can be pronounced against a person there must have been a trial of the issue upon which the judgment is given. In re Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 593</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 489 (1962).
   <br />

        Dismissal Proceedings.
   
   - Due process under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions requires that a permanent State employee who has been dismissed be provided with a statement in writing setting forth his rights of appeal before time limits for notice of appeal commence to run. Luck v. Employment Sec. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 192, 272 S.E.2d 607 (1980).

       <p>
        Issuance of Domestic Violence Protective Order.
   
   - Defendant's due process rights were not violated by the issuance of the domestic violence protective order requiring him to surrender his firearms, because, in a domestic violence situation, a valid government interest is at stake and justifies postponing a hearing until after the deprivation. State v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 745 S.E.2d 26 (2013), dismissed and review denied 749 S.E.2d 885, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1282.

       <p>
        Parental Rights.
   
   - Trial court's factual finding that the father was fit to raise his minor child did not preclude the trial court from making the legal conclusion that the father, in engaging in conduct constituting abandonment and neglect of the minor child, acted in a manner inconsistent with his constitutionally-protected status as a parent; however, the trial court erred because it was required to find the existence of that conduct by clear and convincing evidence, which it did not do. David N. v. Jason N., <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 303</cite>, 608 S.E.2d 751 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Biological father's substantive due process rights under the United States and North Carolina Constitutions were not violated because the father made very few efforts after the birth of the child to develop a parent-child relationship. As such, he did not fall within the class of protected fathers who could claim a liberty interest in developing a relationship with the child, his consent to the adoption of the child was not necessary, and the adoption chapter was not unconstitutional as applied to the father. Robinson v. Perkins, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 308, 767 S.E.2d 395 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Parents' Rights.
   
   - Where the court merely recited the testimony of witnesses and did not make the required findings of fact, further findings of fact and a determination of the father's parental fitness was needed if he was to be denied all contact with his daughter. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 569, 587 S.E.2d 74 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Engage in Legitimate Business.
   
   - Court of appeals, in upholding a dental board's rule, stated that the right to engage in legitimate business was not fundamental for purposes of federal due process analysis, and so applied a rational basis rather than strict scrutiny approach in its substantive due process and equal protection analysis. Affordable Care, Inc. v. N.C. State Bd. of Dental Exam'rs, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 527, 571 S.E.2d 52 (2002).

       <p>
        License Revocation.
   
   - Where county commissioners attempted to commission sheriff as a special tribunal to conduct hearings on alleged violations of county ordinance, the provisions for revocation of licenses of massage parlors after a hearing before the sheriff did not afford the constitutionally required "opportunity to be heard or defend in a regular proceeding before a competent tribunal." Parker v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 225 S.E.2d 632 (1976).

        Rate Hearings.
   
   - The Utilities Commission must determine a petition for an increase in telephone rates on the basis of the facts existing at the time such increase is effective, and if a subsequent change in conditions warrants a new rate, such new rate must relate to the date of change and the parties must be accorded an opportunity to be heard with respect to the effect, if any, such change had on the rate structure; a denial of such opportunity would be a deprivation of due process.

        Investor Suits.
   
   - In a suit by investors, the trial court properly held that it lacked personal jurisdiction under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sIIIAa6As1-75.4" target="_blank">G.S. 1-75.4(4)</a></cite> or (5) over a Isle of Guernsey resident who was a director of a Guernsey corporation, as the investors had not been solicited by the resident or on his behalf and money had not been transferred to him on his order or direction; moreover, there were no minimum contacts, as the resident's uncontradicted affidavit indicated that he had never met or spoken with the investors, visited North Carolina, or given investment advice to the investors. Robbins v. Ingham, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 764, 635 S.E.2d 610 (2006), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 221</cite> (2007).

        No Due Process Right of Entitlement in Terminable at Will Contract.
   
   - Where there was nothing in the record which suggested that plaintiff had a contract for a definite term, her contract of employment was terminable at the will of either party, irrespective of the quality of performance, and plaintiff had no property interest in employment and no legitimate claim of entitlement under the due process clause. Peele v. Provident Mut. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 368 S.E.2d 892, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 366</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 547 (1988).

        City of Charlotte's grievance procedure was not adopted pursuant to an ordinance or expressly incorporated by the City Council into plaintiff's employment contract and the undisputed material facts show that plaintiff was nothing more than an "at-will" employee, and, therefore, he was not entitled to the procedural safeguards of U.S. Const., Amend.

   50-104(g), the employee was never entitled to collect retirement benefits upon her disability and, thus, her interest in those benefits was not a protected property interest; under its code, the city reserved the option to transfer a disabled police officer to another position in the police department or elsewhere in the city.

        Prosecutor's Comments.
   
   - Prosecutor's arguments, including statements comparing defendant's cozy life in prison and his numerous protections under the Constitution with victims' lack of opportunities, was unlikely to have influenced the jury's sentencing recommendations and, therefore, did not deny the defendant his constitutional due process rights.

        Principle of Equal Protection Expressly Incorporated.
   
   - The principle of the equal protection of the law, made explicit in U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, has now been expressly incorporated in this section. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Two-tiered Equal Protection Analysis.
   
   - Courts employ a two-tiered scheme of analysis when an equal protection claim is made. When a governmental act classifies persons in terms of their ability to exercise a fundamental right, or when a governmental classification distinguishes between persons in terms of any right, upon some "suspect" basis, the upper tier of equal protection analysis is employed. Calling for "strict scrutiny," this standard requires the government to demonstrate that the classification is necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest. When an equal protection claim does not involve a "suspect class" or a fundamental right, the lower tier of equal protection analysis is employed. This mode of analysis merely requires that distinctions which are drawn by a challenged statute or action bear some rational relationship to a conceivable legitimate governmental interest. Abbott v. Town of Highlands, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 277 S.E.2d 820, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 710</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 136 (1981).

       <p>
        Equal Protection Extends to Persons, Not Rights.
   
   - The equal protection clauses of the State and federal Constitutions prohibit denial of the equal protection of the laws to persons, not to rights. Edwards v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 256 S.E.2d 728 (1979).

   - Because eligible students were capable of raising a discrimination claim on their own behalf should the circumstances warrant such action, taxpayers had no standing to assert a direct discrimination claim on the students' behalf; the taxpayers were not eligible students alleged to have suffered religious discrimination as a result of the admission or educational practices of a nonpublic school participating in the Opportunity Scholarship Program.

        County citizens stated a claim by alleging that a board of education redistricting plan violated the one person, one vote principle by discriminating between urban and rural voters and against Democratic incumbents; the district court erred in finding that the claim was nonjusticiable in the absence of any North Carolina case law supporting such a finding. Wright v. North Carolina, 787 F.3d 256 (4th Cir. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature may make classifications and distinctions in the application of laws
   
   provided they are reasonable and just and not arbitrary. Motley v. State Bd. of Barber Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 337</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 550, 175 A.L.R. 253 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative bodies may make classifications for the application of regulations, provided the classifications are practicable and apply equally to all persons within a class, since the constitutional mandate proscribing discrimination requires only that there be no inequality among those within a particular group or class. State v. Trantham, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 641</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 198 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative bodies may distinguish, select, and classify objects of legislation. It suffices if the classification is practical. They may prescribe different regulations for different classes, and discrimination as between classes is not such as to invalidate the legislative enactment. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        A state may classify in a statute with reference to the evil to be prevented, and if the class discriminated against is or reasonably might be considered to define those from whom the evil mainly is to be feared, it properly may be picked out. The State may direct its law against what it deems the evil as it actually exists without covering the whole field of possible abuses. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no constitutional requirement that a regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every class to which it might be applied, that is, that the legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV nor the similar language in this section takes from the State the power to classify persons or activities when there is reasonable basis for such classification and for the consequent difference in treatment under the law. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1972); A-S-P Assocs. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 207</cite>, 258 S.E.2d 444 (1979); Responsible Citizens v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 255</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 204 (1983); Lamb v. Wedgewood S. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 419</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 868 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal protection clauses do not require perfection in respect of classifications.
   
   In borderline cases, the legislative determination is entitled to great weight. Lamb v. Wedgewood S. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 419</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 868 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the area of economics and social welfare, a state does not violate the equal protection clause merely because the classifications made by its laws are imperfect. If the classification has some "reasonable basis," it does not offend the Constitution simply because the classification is not made with mathematical nicety or because in practice it results in some inequality. Glusman v. Trustees of Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 629</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 213 (1972), vacated on other grounds, 412 U.S. 947, 93 S. Ct. 2999, 37 L. Ed. 2d 999 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislation may not discriminate arbitrarily,
   
   either as between persons or groups of persons or as between activities which are prohibited and those which are permitted. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To withstand an equal protection claim a statute's classification must be reasonable,
   
   not arbitrary, and must rest on some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike. North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The traditional equal-protection test does not require the very best classification in the light of a legislative or regulatory purpose; however, it does require that such classification in relation to such purpose attain a minimum (undefined and undefinable) level of rationality. Glusman v. Trustees of Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 629</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 213 (1972), vacated on other grounds, 412 U.S. 947, 93 S. Ct. 2999, 37 L. Ed. 2d 999 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative classifications will be upheld provided the classification is founded upon reasonable distinctions, affects all persons similarly situated or engaged in the same business without discrimination, and has some reasonable relation to the public peace, welfare and safety. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires that if a class is created there must be a reasonable basis for such classification and the consequent difference in treatment under the law. This means that the creation of the class must be reasonably related to the accomplishment of some purpose which the legislature has the power to reach. Durham Council of Blind v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 339 S.E.2d 84, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 552</cite>, 344 S.E.2d 5 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Validity Depends upon Reasonable Relation to Accomplishment of Legitimate Objective.
   
   - The validity of a specific State statute or ordinance depends upon its reasonable relation to the accomplishment of the State's legitimate objective. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a special class of persons is singled out by the legislature for special treatment, there must be a reasonable relation between the classification and the object of the statute. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972); In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The equal protection clauses of the United States Constitution and the Constitution of North Carolina require that in making classifications there be no discrimination, that is, that there be some reasonable relation between the class created and the legislative end to be obtained. Ledwell v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 249 S.E.2d 862 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 585</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 35 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test is Reasonableness in Relation to Purpose and Subject Matter.
   
   - The test required by this section is whether the difference in treatment made by the law has a reasonable basis in relation to the purpose and subject matter of the legislation. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1972); Responsible Citizens v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 255</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 204 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The equal protection clauses of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions impose upon law-making bodies the requirement that any legislative classification be based on differences that are reasonably related to the purposes of the act in which it is found. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972); North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973); In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976); Brown v. Brannon, 399 F. Supp. 133 (M.D.N.C. 1975), aff'd, 535 F.2d 1249 (4th Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the area of economics and social welfare, a statute containing a legislative classification which is rationally related to a legitimate state objective does not violate this section or the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. The traditional equal-protection test does not require the very best classification in the light of a legislative or regulatory purpose, but does require that such classification in relation to such purpose attain a minimum (undefined and undefinable) level of rationality. State v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 339 S.E.2d 668 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature's Classification will be Presumed Valid.
   
   - Although the reasonableness of a particular classification is a question for the court, there is a presumption that the classification is valid, because such classifications are largely matters of legislative judgment. Therefore, a court may not substitute its judgment of what is reasonable for that of the legislative body, particularly when the reasonableness of a particular classification is fairly debatable. Lamb v. Wedgewood S. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 419</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 868 (1983).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Protection Against Unreasonable Discrimination Extends to Administration and Execution of Laws.
   
   - The provisions of the "law of the land" clause of the Constitution of North Carolina and U.S. Const., Amend. XIV afford protection against discriminatory actions of officials in administering the law. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional protection in this section against unreasonable discrimination under color of law is not limited to the enactment of legislation. It extends also to the administration and the execution of laws valid on their face. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971); State v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 116</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 204 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Discriminatory Administration Is a Denial of Equal Protection.
   
   - Even if a law itself is fair on its face and impartial in appearance, if it is applied and administered by public authority with an evil eye and an unequal hand, so as to make unjust and illegal discriminations between persons in similar circumstances, material to their rights, this denial of equal justice is still within the prohibition of the Constitution. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discriminatory administration of an ordinance is a denial of the equal protection of the law. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere Laxity in Enforcement Does Not Render Law Invalid.
   
   - Mere laxity, delay or inefficiency of the police department or of the prosecutor in the enforcement of a statute or ordinance which is otherwise valid does not destroy the law or render it invalid and unenforceable. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor does selective enforcement have that effect
   
   if it has a reasonable relation to the purpose of the legislation, such as making efficient use of police manpower by concentrating upon the major sources of the criminal activity. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless There Is Intentional or Purposeful Discrimination.
   
   - Unlawful administration by state officers of a state statute which is fair on its face, resulting in its unequal application to those who are entitled to be treated alike, is not a denial of equal protection unless an element of intentional or purposeful discrimination is shown. Such discriminatory purpose is not presumed. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971).
   <br />

   3(3) and 5(3) are interpreted consistent with federal law and reconciled with equal protection requirements under the state constitution by requiring the formation of single-member districts in North Carolina legislative redistricting plans.

        Judicial Districts.
   
   - Expressive conduct, which combines elements of a fundamental right with conduct generally subject to regulation reviewed only for a rational basis, is analogous to judicial elections, in that such elections combine representative and nonrepresentative aspects; therefore, a similar standard of intermediate scrutiny is applied when considering equal protection challenges to judicial districts, and judicial districts will be sustained if the legislature's formulations advance important governmental interests unrelated to vote dilution and do not weaken voter strength substantially more than necessary to further those interests.

        Superior Court Elections Subject to Heightened Level of Scrutiny.
   
   - Judicial elections have a component that implicates the fundamental right to vote and a separate component that is ordinarily the province of the legislature, subject only to review for rationality by the courts, and because the right to vote on equal terms for representatives triggers heightened scrutiny, even as the nonrepresentative aspects inherent in the role of the judiciary preclude strict scrutiny on a one-person, one-vote standard, neither rational basis nor strict scrutiny is an appropriate standard of review; the right to vote in superior court elections on substantially equal terms is a quasi-fundamental right which is subject to a heightened level of scrutiny, and the Equal Protection Clause, N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   19, requires intermediate scrutiny of districts drawn for the election of superior court judges. Blankenship v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 518</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 759 (2009).

        Equal Protection Clause Applies to Creation of Additional Judgeship.
   
   - Court of appeals erred in reversing a trial court's judgment entered in favor of attorneys qualified to run for superior court judge and a voter in their action against the North Carolina State Board of Elections and the attorney general alleging that the 1993 amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa07s7A-41" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-41</a></cite> unconstitutionally created an additional superior court judgeship in Wake County Superior Court District 10A because the Equal Protection Clause, N.C.

   </span>
   19, applied to the General Assembly's creation of an additional judgeship in District 10A, and the attorneys and voter demonstrated gross disparity in voting power between similarly situated residents of the county; residents of District 10A had a voting power roughly five times greater than residents of District 10C, four and a half times greater than residents of District 10B, and four times greater than residents of District 10D, and the matter was remanded to the trial court remand to the trial court with orders to hold a new hearing and determine whether the State could meet its burden of demonstrating significant interests that justified the legislature's subdivisions within District 10 and to show that the disparity in voter strength was not substantially greater than necessary to accommodate those interests.

        Single and Multi-Member Voting Districts.
   
   - Use of both single-member and multi-member districts within the same redistricting plan violates the equal protection clause of the state constitution unless it is established that inclusion of multi-member districts advances a compelling state interest; hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing, that the use of such districts advances a compelling state interest within the context of a specific, proposed remedial plan.

        It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) because absent an injunction, the voters have showed they were likely to suffer irreparable harm; S.B. 824's voter-ID requirements were likely to disproportionately impact African American voters to their detriment, and enjoining the voter-ID provisions furthered the public interest, which favored permitting as many qualified voters to vote as possible.

        Voters showed the need for a statewide preliminary injunction barring legislators from implementing or enforcing the voter-ID provisions of Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) as to all North Carolina voters pending a ruling on the merits of the voters' facial challenge under the North Carolina Constitution because the alleged violation, the alleged facial unconstitutionality of S.B. 824, impacted the entire State of North Carolina.

       <p>
        It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction because they showed a likelihood of success on the merits in demonstrating discriminatory intent was a motivating factor behind enacting Senate Bill 824, entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote"; they sufficiently showed the act's historical background, the unusual sequence of events leading up to passage, legislative history, and evidence of disproportionate impact.

   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Voters made a sufficient preliminary showing that even if the General Assembly followed its rules, the process employed in enacting Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) was nevertheless unusual because sixty-one of the legislators who voted in favor of S.B. 824 had previously voted to enact a law thatwas struck down as motivated by a discriminatory intent; S.B. 824 was passed in a short timeframe by a lame-duck-Republican supermajority, which showed an intent to push through legislation.

        Legislative history supported voters' claim of an underlying motive of discriminatory intent in the enactment of Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824), entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote," because the voters presented some evidence suggesting the General Assembly refused to obtain updated data on the effects of S.B. 824's voter-ID provisions, instead relying on outdated data, and chose not to include certain types of ID disproportionately held by African Americans.

        Non-career State employee did not establish an equal protection claim based on the fact that career State employees, as defined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a01s126-1.1" target="_blank">G.S. 126-1.1</a></cite>, had more extensive procedural and substantive rights because the employee did not articulate how career employees were similarly situated.

        In a student's action alleging that a board of education violated N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   19, the trial court erred in denying the board's motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted because no law supported the student's claim for relief; assuming, without in any way deciding, that N.C. Const., Art. I,

        In a case where a law enforcement officer's certification was suspended for 180 days, to the extent that the officer was treated differently from similarly situated officers, the differential treatment had to be rationally related to the substantial public interest in preserving the credibility of law enforcement officer certifications. The officer here was not alike in all relevant respects to the officers who received reprimands or warnings instead of a suspension. Krueger v. N.C. Crim. Justice Educ. &amp; Training Stds.

       <p>
        Estates of deceased victims of involuntary sterilization did not show the statutory limitation of compensation for such sterilization to victims living on a certain date violated equal protection because the statute was rationally related to legitimate governmental interests of (1) not reducing actual victims' compensation, (2) avoiding the cost of determining deceased victims' heirs, and (3) focusing on victims who could benefit from compensation. In re Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 699, 801 S.E.2d 680 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Estates of deceased victims of involuntary sterilization did not show the statutory limitation of compensation for such sterilization to victims living on a certain date violated equal protection because the estates did not show the estates were similarly situated to the intended beneficiaries.

        Substantial Rights Not Affected.
   
   - Trial court's order denying a towing company's motion for a preliminary injunction against enforcing a city ordinance did not impact its substantial rights to equal protection where the ordinance did not appear to discriminate among classes of towing companies, but among the types of property and situations in which its provisions applied, and although the broad and substantial exemptions may have rendered its regulations ambiguous and effectively null, the question of its interpretation was not before the appellate court and remained to be determined by the trial court.

        Due Process and Equal Protection Suit Barred by Res Judicata.
   
   - Where a student allegedly was treated differently than three boys who assaulted the student, the student's due process and equal protection suit against a county board of education was barred by res judicata because the dismissal of the student's prior suit on grounds of sovereign immunity was a final judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata; there was identity of the causes of action since the student could have amended the complaint to assert the constitutional claims upon the filing of the board's answer. Herring v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 656 S.E.2d 307 (2008).

       <p>
        Illustrative Cases
   
   - Summary judgment was inappropriate on plaintiffs' equal protection claim which alleged that the defendants violated this section by asserting sovereign immunity in their case while customarily waiving it for similarly situated individuals. The city failed to offer an explanation as to how its differing treatment of tort claimants was based on differences between the claimants and how these differences were rationally related to a legitimate governmental objective.

        Teachers' equal protection allegations against the school board, even when assumed correct and construed most favorably, merely expressed disconcert with actions wholly consistent with the school board's authority under state law; because the teachers failed to allege an essential element of an equal protection claim - namely, arbitrary or irrational state action - their equal protection claims were properly dismissed.

        Even though a student failed to preserve an equal protection challenge to a suspension by failing to assign error or present authority, the argument was meritless at any rate under arbitrary and capricious review because there was a gender-neutral reason for a longer suspension; prior incidents of "shanking" at a high school did not result in the exposure of buttocks or genitalia.

        Trial court properly granted a county's motion for summary judgment because its ordinance did not violate the federal or state Equal Protection and Commerce Clauses and was not preempted by the cited statutes and regulations because the ordinance did not burden a suspect class or affect a fundamental right, its requirements were rationally related to the county's interest in the health, safety, and welfare of the community, and did impose greater burdens on regional municipal landfills.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Due process does not preclude the rights of public justice.
   
   State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 359</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 891 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84 S. Ct. 977, 11 L. Ed. 2d 974 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The discretion of the trial judge
   
   given him over the trial of a cause is rarely interfered with, though his action may be set aside for such gross abuse as would invade the legal rights to the prejudice of the appealing party. State v. Sauls, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 810</cite>, 130 S.E. 848 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge Not Required to Aid in Presentation of Defense.
   
   - A trial judge is not required by either the federal or State Constitutions to aid a defendant on trial before him in the presentation of his defense. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's Remarks on Failure to Accept Plea Agreement.
   
   - Defendant's right to a jury trial was not violated at sentencing despite the trial judge's remarks about defendant's rejection of the plea offer because the judge focused on defendant's submission of false testimony and "fabricated" evidence in justifying the sentence imposed. State v. Tice, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 664 S.E.2d 368 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's Comment Did Not Deprive Defendant of Fair Trial.
   
   - Trial judge's remarks, prompting the prosecutor to elicit an identification from the victim, did not deprive defendant of a fair trial; by raising the issue while the victim was still on the stand, the trial court avoided inconvenience to the victim and the waste of judicial resources in having the State later seek to recall the victim or reopen its case. State v. Ryder, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 56, 674 S.E.2d 805 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Criminal Statute or Ordinance Must Be Definite.
   
   - A criminal statute or ordinance must be sufficiently definite to inform citizens of common intelligence of the particular acts which are forbidden. State v. Sanders, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 245 S.E.2d 397 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        15-Year Delay in Charging Sexual Assault.
   
   - Defendant's conviction for sexual offense in the second degree and rape in the second degree were upheld on appeal, because there was no violation of defendant's due process rights due to a 15-year delay in the victim reporting the crimes and defendant being charged; no statute of limitations exists for the crimes of rape, sex offense, or indecent liberties with a minor. State v. Stanford, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 609 S.E.2d 468 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Delay Between Arrest and Appearance Before Magistrate.
   
   - Trial court's findings of fact supported its conclusion that there was no violation of defendant's constitutional right to be taken before a court official without unnecessary delay because defendant was arrested at 9:00 a.m. by officers without a warrant, and after his interview concluded at 2:53 p.m., a magistrate issued warrants charging him with drug offenses, murder, and robbery; that satisfied the requirement that a magistrate promptly determine probable cause. State v. Caudill, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 119, 742 S.E.2d 268 (2013), dismissed and review denied, 747 S.E.2d 578, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 929 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretion to Prosecute for Capital Offense.
   
   - Defendant's argument that he was denied due process because the district attorney has the absolute discretion to charge and prosecute an accused for a capital offense or to bring him to trial upon a lesser included offense has been considered and rejected in a number of cases. State v. Bush, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 159</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 333, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumptions of unlawfulness and malice
   
   arising from an intentional assault with a deadly weapon proximately resulting in death are constitutional. State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 239</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 268 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Short-form Indictment.
   
   - Court of appeals rejected defendant's argument that the trial court violated his rights under U.S. Const., Amends. V, VI, and XIV and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of post-indictment motions for probable cause hearing.
   
   - In a prosecution for first-degree murder and armed robbery, the denial of defendants' post-indictment motions for a probable cause hearing did not violate <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIa29s15A-606ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-606(a)</a></cite> or deprive defendants of equal protection and due process of law. State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 28</cite>, 274 S.E.2d 183 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delays in Bond Hearing and Release Held Constitutional.
   
   - Neither the delay in receiving a bond hearing nor the additional time defendant was required to remain in custody after the hearing violated the defendant's due process rights or <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Va26s15A-534.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-534.1</a></cite>, where the defendant was taken into custody in the evening, brought before a judge the next day, and then detained another five hours before being released on a $1,000 unsecured bond. There was no evidence that an arbitrary limit was placed on the time defendant would be held in detention before seeing a judge; defendant was brought before a judge as soon as one was available; and the additional five-hour detention was not unreasonable. State v. Gilbert, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 535 S.E.2d 94 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Same Judge for Pretrial and Trial.
   
   - There is no right to have the same judge hear all pretrial motions and other procedural matters as well as preside over the trial itself, whether the trial is complicated or straightforward. State v. McLaughlin, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 68</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 49 (1988), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 1463, 108 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1990), in light of State v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 784</cite>, 42 S.E. 814 (1902).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Inspect Files of State Bureau of Investigation.
   
   - Where there was no contention that anything in the files of the State Bureau of Investigation was admitted into evidence and the record showed that no member of the Bureau testified during the trial, defendants' contention that they were entitled to an inspection of the files of the Bureau in regard to its investigation of the case was untenable, and denial of their petition for such inspection did not violate any of their rights under this section, or under U.S. Const., Amends. V, VI, VII and XIV. State v. Goldberg, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 181</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 334, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 978, 84 S. Ct. 1884, 12 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that evidence was obtained by police officers outside of their territorial jurisdiction
   
   while conducting an undercover investigation was not fundamentally unfair to defendant. State v. Afflerback, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 264 S.E.2d 784 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Promise by Police Officer.
   
   - Police officer's promise not to prosecute the defendant as an habitual offender was just as capable of implicating the defendant's constitutional rights as a promise made by a prosecutor, once the right to counsel had attached or custodial interrogation begun, and the protections of due process necessarily arose. State v. Sturgill, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 629, 469 S.E.2d 557 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to prepare a defense was violated
   
   when the trial court, after ordering the State to turn over test-fired bullets and underlying data examinations for a defense ballistics examination, upon the State's revelation that it had lost the original shells, refused to require the State to retest the weapon in question and allowed the State's ballistics expert to testify. State v. Canady, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 242</cite>, 559 S.E.2d 762 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's statutory sexual offense conviction was reversed and he was granted a new trial because the sealed portion of a department of social services file subpoenaed by defendant provided an alternative explanation for the victim's abuse; the file showed that: (1) the victim's brother had a history of violence, (2) the mother had left the victim alone with the brother, (3) the victim had lied in the past in meetings with a social worker, (4) the mother believed that she might have caused one of the victim's injuries, and (5) the mother believed that it was possible that the brother had sexually abused the victim. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 854, 599 S.E.2d 599 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Right to Testify.
   
   - Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to reopen the case after defendant reconsidered his decision not to testify because the trial court had repeatedly asked defendant if he wished to testify, gave him the opportunity to talk to counsel, and defendant indicated that he did not want to testify. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 823 S.E.2d 892 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Destruction of Evidence.
   
   - Whether destruction of physical evidence by the State infringes upon accused's rights depends upon circumstances in each case. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 292 S.E.2d 163, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 372 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Destruction of marijuana by State for lack of storage facilities, where State made random samples, photographs and a copy of the laboratory report available to defendants, did not violate defendants' rights of confrontation under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23, nor infringe defendants' due process rights under the federal and State Constitutions. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 292 S.E.2d 163, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 372 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although evidence seized from defendant's home was missing at the time of trial, defendant was not denied due process where there was no showing of bad faith or willful intent to destroy the evidence on the part of any law enforcement officer. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 720</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 417 (1997).

        When the State destroyed a knife that was involved in defendant's alleged crimes after defendant's convictions were affirmed, defendant's due process rights were not violated because (1) defendant never claimed the evidence was destroyed in bad faith, and, (2) despite the knife's unavailability, defense counsel was able to elicit impeaching testimony from the State's witnesses concerning the knife. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 488</cite>, 724 S.E.2d 492 (2012).

        Inadvertent Destruction of Evidence.
   
   - Defendant's rights were not violated by inadvertent destruction of rape kit by police and there was no showing of bad faith on the part of the police where there was no reason for the police to believe the rape kit had any exculpatory value at the time of its destruction.

        Equal Access to Criminal Records of Jurors.
   
   - An indigent defendant's lack of access to the Police Information Network (PIN) did not deny the defendant equal access to information in violation of this section of the North Carolina Constitution, where the court suggested alternative means to obtaining such information on jurors, and the defendant's counsel did not subsequently object to the trial court's action or move for funds with which the defense could run its own criminal record checks. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 531</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 773 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 949, 121 S. Ct. 1419, 149 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2001).

        The unsupported testimony of an accomplice is sufficient to support a conviction
   
   if it satisfies a jury of defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Partlow, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 60</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 688 (1967).

        The fact that the prosecuting attorney reads the charges
   
   or fairly summarizes them to the defendant before the jury is not a violation of defendant's right to due process and equal protection as required by the Constitutions of this State and the United States. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 59, 226 S.E.2d 179, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 664</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 455 (1976).

        Prosecutor's Statements.
   
   - The defendant constitutional rights under Article I, Sections 19, 23, and 27 of the North Carolina Constitution were not violated by the prosecution's argument in opposition to the "catchall" mitigating circumstance of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1f" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(f)</a></cite> that the jury should not give any mitigating value to the fact that his accomplice was not sentenced to death where the prosecution did not imply that the accomplice's sentence could be treated as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. State v. Roseboro, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 536</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1019, 121 S. Ct. 582, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to a new trial due to the State's improper closing argument which was sufficiently close to making an association between defendant and a wild animal to lead to such an inference, including a statement that "he who hunts with the pack is responsible for the kill," multiple references to hunting on the African plain when defendant was an African-American, and references to an accomplice as an "alpha male" and to defendant as a follower in the pack, as: (1) the State did not misstate the evidence or the law in making its argument, (2) the trial court instructed the jury that closing arguments were not evidence, (3) there was an abundance of evidence, both physical and testimonial, that defendant was guilty of the crimes charged, and (4) although improper, the State's comments did not deny defendant due process. State v. Sims, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 588 S.E.2d 55 (2003).

        Jury's Consideration of Date Charged in Indictment.
   
   - In a prosecution for rape upon an indictment which alleged that the crime occurred on March 24, 1978, defendant was not denied a fair trial because of the court's failure to limit the jury's consideration to the specific date charged in the indictment, where a contextual reading of the record made it clear that the jury's consideration of the crime was restricted to defendant's actions on or about March 24, 1978, the record revealed nothing indicating that defendant was surprised or hampered by any attempt of the State to alter the date charged in the bill of indictment, and defendant squarely met the State's evidence concerning his actions on or about March 24, 1978. State v. Summitt, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 591</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 425, cert. denied, 451 U.S. 970, 101 S. Ct. 2048, 68 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1981).

        Jury Instructions.
   
   - Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional rights where no conflict existed between the "Issues and Recommendation as to Punishment" form and the oral instructions given by the trial court. State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 518</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 131 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1164, 120 S. Ct. 1181, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instruction on reasonable doubt was not improper in including the following language: "A reasonable doubt is not a vain doubt; it's not a fanciful doubt; it's not proof beyond all doubt; it's not proof beyond a shadow of a doubt. There are few things in human existence we can prove beyond all doubt and a shadow of a doubt." State v. Burke, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 648 S.E.2d 256 (2007).

       <p>
        Setting Aside of Judgment on Negotiated Plea Held Error.
   
   - Where negotiated plea had been adjudicated and sentence had been imposed, no valid reason had been offered by the State to set aside that plea and adjudication, and defendant could not again be tried for the charges which underlied the indictments without twice being placed in jeopardy, trial judge's setting aside of the judgment which had been entered on the negotiated plea agreement was error.

        Reservation of Ruling on Motion to Dismiss.
   
   - When defendants moved to dismiss charges at the close of all the evidence, a trial court's reservation of a ruling on defendants' motions, which was contrary to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1227ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1227(c)</a></cite>, requiring the court to rule immediately, did not create reversible error or violate defendants' rights under U.S. Const., Amends.

        Transcript of Separate and Distinct Proceeding Against Different Defendants.
   
   - Denial of defendant's request for a transcript of a separate and distinct proceeding with a different jury and different defendants did not constitute a violation of defendant's due process and equal protection rights, because in the absence of compelling evidence of the need for a transcript of a separate proceeding to afford defendant adequate tools for his defense, and no alternative means of obtaining such information, the State should not be required to furnish such a transcript. State v. McCullough, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 184, 272 S.E.2d 613 (1980).

XIV, and would be vacated in post-conviction proceedings. McClure v. State, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 212</cite>, 148 S.E.2d 15 (1966).

         Showing Required of Defendant Deprived of Right to Appeal.
        </b>
        - When a defendant has been deprived of his right to a complete and effective appeal, he need not demonstrate that he was prejudiced or that he has arguable grounds for a successful appeal; thus, in determining whether the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated, the court should not examine the merits of the issues to be raised in a belated appeal. Galloway v. Stephenson, 510 F. Supp. 840 (M.D.N.C. 1981).

       <p>
        <b>
         Remedy When Defendant Is Denied Right of Appeal.
        </b>
        - When a petitioner has been unconstitutionally denied his appeal, the deficit may be fully rectified should the State grant a belated appeal, and nothing more will be necessary to correct the constitutional violation; however, should the State be unable to secure for petitioner a belated appeal, it could, nevertheless, also correct the violation by vacating the conviction and granting petitioner another trial and appeal. Galloway v. Stephenson, 510 F. Supp. 840 (M.D.N.C. 1981).

       <p>
        Injunctive Relief Against Enforcement of Ordinance by Criminal Prosecution.
   
   - Nothing else appearing, the enforcement of an ordinance by the criminal prosecution of those who violate it will not be enjoined in a suit brought by an acknowledged violator, whose contention is that the ordinance is invalid or that it is administered or enforced in a discriminatory manner in violation of the equal protection of the laws. His right to present this defense at his trial on the criminal charge, or to maintain a civil action for damages, constitutes an adequate remedy at law. Where, however, a plaintiff's legitimate business is threatened with destruction, through an announced purpose of making repeated arrests of his employees or customers and charging them with the violation of an allegedly invalid law, a suit for injunctive relief is an appropriate procedure for testing the equal protection constitutionality of the law or of the contemplated enforcement program. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 654</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 382 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a justice's compensation was fixed upon a fee basis,
   
   which he would receive only in the event of conviction, held not to result in depriving the defendant of trial under due process of law. In re Steele, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 685</cite>, 18 S.E.2d 132, cert. denied, 316 U.S. 686, 62 S. Ct. 1275, 86 L. Ed. 1758 (1942).

       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's announcement of his ruling in open court could not reasonably be characterized as a hearing,
   
   much less one at which defendant's presence was required, where judge simply took a final step in the process of deciding whether to release any part of defendant's prison records to the prosecution and announced his decision from the bench. State v. Rich, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 50</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 394, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1002, 118 S. Ct. 573, 139 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1997).

        Single Comprehensive Mitigating Circumstances Instruction Allowed in Murder Trial
   
   - The trial court did not err by denying defendant's request for separate instructions on each of his three alleged mental impairments under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1f6" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(f)(6)</a></cite> or by giving a single instruction combining all of the mental impairments into a single mitigating circumstance. The trial court's instruction specifically referred to each of the alleged mental disorders - his "personality disorder," "borderline range of intelligence," and "long-term, chronic and severe abuse of crack-cocaine at and around the time of the offenses" - and instructed the jury to consider whether one or all of them impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the law. State v. Roseboro, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 536</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1019, 121 S. Ct. 582, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).

        Executive Clemency.
   
   - To the extent that due process rights apply to clemency procedures in North Carolina, they extend no further than the minimal due process rights required by Woodard; therefore, state constitutional claims that attack the governor's exercise of clemency power are not reviewable beyond the minimal safeguards applied to state clemency procedures by Woodard.

        Defendant's Rights Not Violated.
   
   - It was error to hold that the State violated defendant's rights under the Constitution because as a result of the State's improper prosecution in superior court, defendant had to appear in that court to seek dismissal of the prosecution and had to appear before the court of appeals following the State's appeal State v.

        A defendant is not entitled to demand a proportionate number of his race on the jury which tries him nor on the venire from which petit jurors are drawn. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Petit juries must be drawn from a source fairly representative of the community;
   
   however, petit juries actually chosen need not mirror the community nor reflect the various distinctive groups in the population. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1990).

        In the absence of a contention that blacks were systematically and arbitrarily excluded from the jury pool, unless there is systematic and arbitrary exclusion, then a defendant has no right to be indicted or tried by a jury of his own race or even to have a representative of his race on the jury.

        Preparation of Jury List.
   
   - A jury list is not discriminatory or unlawful because it is drawn from the tax list of the county.

        Trial Judge Has Discretion to Dismiss Jurors Whose Answers Conflict.
   
   - The trial court did not abuse its discretion in violation of Article I, Sections 19, 23, and 27 of the North Carolina Constitution and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa72s15A-1212" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1212</a></cite> by excusing for cause a juror who told the prosecutor that he had reasonably strong religious beliefs about the death penalty which he had held for a long period of time; that, because of those beliefs, it would be hard for him to find the death penalty warranted under any circumstances; that his religious beliefs would substantially impair his duty as a juror to recommend to the trial court a punishment of death if the evidence warranted it; but that he could follow the law and "go by which one I thought was right, whoever proved the most." State v. Greene, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 562</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 575 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1041, 121 S. Ct. 635, 148 L. Ed. 2d 543 (2000).

        State's Challenges to Jurors Opposed to Death Penalty Upheld.
   
   - Where it was perfectly clear from their answers that each of the prospective jurors, before hearing any of the evidence, had already made up his mind that he would not return a verdict pursuant to which the defendant might lawfully be executed whatever the evidence might be, the State's challenges for cause were properly sustained. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The practice of "death qualifying" juries in capital cases violates neither the United States Constitution nor this section of the North Carolina Constitution. State v. Barts, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 666</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 828 (1986); State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 343</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 596 (1986); State v.

        It was not error under this section or N.C. Const., Art. I,

Ct. 1770, 20 L. Ed. 2d 776, rehearing denied, 393 U.S. 898, 89 S. Ct. 67, 21 L. Ed. 2d 186 (1968); State v.

        The erroneous allowance of an improper challenge for cause
   
   does not entitle the adverse party to a new trial, so long as only those who are competent and qualified to serve are actually empaneled upon the jury which tried his case. State v. Bernard, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 321</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 327 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test for Determining Discrimination.
   
   - The test is not whether a member of defendant's race did or did not serve on the grand jury in question, nor is it whether there has been discrimination in the selection of other grand juries in the past. The determinative question is whether, in the selection of the grand jury which returned the indictment under attack, there was or was not systematic and arbitrary exclusion of qualified members of defendant's race, either in the composition of the jury box from which the grand jury was drawn or in the drawing therefrom of the grand jury in question. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Opportunity to Prove.
   
   - Whether or not the defendant can establish alleged racial discrimination in the drawing and selection of the grand jury, due process of law demands that he have his day in court on this matter, and such day he does not have, unless he has a reasonable opportunity and time to investigate and produce his evidence, if he has any. State v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 495</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 822 (1963); State v. Inman, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 311</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 613 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        One who is indicted for a criminal offense must have a fair opportunity to have it determined by adequate and timely procedure whether members of his race, legally qualified to serve as jurors, have been intentionally excluded on account of their race or color from the grand jury returning the indictment. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 380</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 897 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of proving discriminatory jury practices is upon defendant,
   
   but this does not relieve the prosecuting attorney of the duty of going forward with the evidence when the defendant has made out a prima facie case. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden is upon the defendant to establish racial discrimination alleged in his motion to quash the indictment. However, once a prima facie case is made out, the burden shifts to the prosecution. State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 556</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 457 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prima Facie Showing.
   
   - Where, at a hearing upon a motion to quash the bill of indictment, there was a showing that a substantial percentage of the population of the county from which the grand jury that returned the bill was drawn was black, and that no blacks, or only a token number, had served on the grand juries of the county over a long period of time, such showing made out a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of blacks from service on the grand jury because of race. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        While neither a showing that, over a substantial period of time, in a county with a relatively large black population, only a few blacks had served on juries, nor a showing that the race of the persons whose names appeared on scrolls in the jury box was designated on such scrolls, was conclusive proof of arbitrary and systematic exclusion of blacks from the grand jury which indicted the defendant, such showing did constitute a prima facie showing of the discrimination forbidden by the law of this State, and cast upon the State the burden to go forward with evidence sufficient to overcome it. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it was not enough for the defendant to show that the names which went into the jury box were taken originally from a source which disclosed the race of the persons named in such source material, where the defendant also showed that throughout a substantial period of years, in which essentially the same procedures were used in compiling jury lists, there was repeatedly a marked discrepancy between the number of blacks drawn for grand jury service and the number of blacks whose names appeared on the source material, such circumstances made out a prima facie case of unconstitutional discrimination in the selection of the grand jury which indicted the defendant, and upon such showing, the burden fell to the State to go forward with competent evidence to rebut such prima facie case. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 380</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 897 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Overcoming Prima Facie Showing.
   
   - To overcome a prima facie case of systematic discrimination because of race, there must be a showing by competent evidence that the institution and management of the jury system of the county is not in fact discriminatory. And if there is contradictory and conflicting evidence, the trial judge must make findings as to all material facts. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as a showing that no blacks served on the particular grand jury which returned the bill of indictment does not make the bill of indictment invalid, so a showing that a black did serve on the particular grand jury, or that a token number of blacks had served on other grand juries, is not necessarily sufficient to rebut a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Color Coding Based on Race.
   
   - Where the evidence disclosed that the names of blacks were printed in red and the names of whites were printed in black in preparing names for the jury box, and that in drawing the names from the box the names of blacks were without exception rejected, the motion of defendant, who was black, to quash the indictment found by a grand jury so selected should have been allowed, since such systematic and arbitrary exclusion of blacks from the grand jury deprived him of his constitutional rights. State v. Speller, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 67</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 537 (1948).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence held sufficient to support a finding that there was no racial discrimination
   
   in the selection of the grand jury. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 119</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 447, cert. denied, 361 U.S. 833, 80 S. Ct. 83, 4 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Record held to contain abundant evidence to support the finding by the trial judge that, in the selection of the grand jury which indicted defendants, there was no arbitrary or systematic exclusion of blacks. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's evidence related to the racial composition of only one grand jury and one list of petit jurors, it did not show a course of conduct over a period of time resulting in an apparent systematic exclusion of blacks from the grand juries or list of petit jurors, and thus failed to establish a prima facie case of systematic exclusion of blacks from either the grand jury which indicted defendant or the petit jury which convicted him. State v. Newkirk, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 53, 187 S.E.2d 394, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 316</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 900 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Juror's Failure to Disclose Information.
   
   - Defendant was not denied his rights to confrontation, to effective assistance of counsel, to due process, to a jury trial, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when the trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial based on the alleged misconduct of a juror; the juror inadvertent failure to disclose the 40-year-old information she had forgotten did not amount to concealment, and the juror demonstrated no bias. State v. Maske, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 40</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 521 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Impartiality of Jury Not Compromised by Juror Who Had "Crossed Paths" With Witness.
   
   - Defendant's right to due process was not violated where a juror failed to indicate during jury selection that he knew a witness as the two had merely "crossed paths before" and thus, there was no possibility that a personal connection to the case compromised the juror's ability to be fair and just. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 591 S.E.2d 917 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Presence of Magistrate on Jury.
   
   - Defendant's constitutional right to an impartial jury was violated as a magistrate served on defendant's jury while having personal knowledge of defendant's prior drug charges and after having direct pretrial involvement with the charges for which the magistrate participated in deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. State v. Neal, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 674 S.E.2d 713 (2009).

        Defendant Has Right to Jury from Which Members of His Race Not Systematically Excluded.
   
   - A citizen has no right to insist that he be indicted or tried by juries composed of persons of his own race, nor to have a person of his own race on the juries which indict and try him. But he has the right to be indicted and tried by juries from which persons of his race have not been systematically excluded. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 419</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 109 (1964); State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the right of any individual to be tried or indicted by a jury of his own race, or to have a representative of any particular race on the jury. It is his right to be tried by a competent jury from which members of his race have not been unlawfully excluded. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).

        Or His Conviction Will Be Invalid.
   
   - Conviction based on the indictment of a grand jury or the verdict of a petit jury from which members of defendant's race were excluded by reason of their race cannot stand. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish a prima facie case of systematic racial exclusion,
   
   defendants are generally required to produce not only statistical evidence establishing that blacks were underrepresented on the jury, but also evidence that the selection procedure itself was not racially neutral, or that for a substantial period in the past relatively few blacks have served on the juries of the county notwithstanding a substantial black population therein, or both. State v. Foddrell, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 546</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 618 (1977).

        Denial Does Not Overcome Prima Facie Discrimination.
   
   - The mere denial, by officials charged with the duty of listing and summoning jurors, of intentional, arbitrary or systematic discrimination on the ground of race is not sufficient to overcome a prima facie case of racial discrimination. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).

        Burden of Proof in Establishing Exclusion from Jury.
   
   - If the motion to quash alleges racial discrimination in the composition of the jury, the burden is upon the defendant to establish it, but once he establishes a prima facie case of racial discrimination, the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence is upon the State. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972); State v.

        Evidence Held Insufficient to Establish Prima Facie Discrimination.
   
   - Evidence that the black adult population of a county amounted to 20% of the total county population and that during the biennium beginning January 1970 approximately 10% of the petit jurors appearing for service in the court room were black was held insufficient to make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony by jury commissioners that, in some instances, they could determine from the address shown on the raw jury list card that a named person lived in a predominantly black or predominantly white neighborhood did not show an opportunity for discrimination sufficient to make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere statement in defendant's brief that the systematic maneuverings of the prosecutor excluded people of defendant's race from the jury, unsupported by the record, failed to show that members of defendant's race were systematically or arbitrarily excluded from the jury panel. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's mere showing that all blacks were challenged by the prosecuting attorney was not sufficient to establish a prima facie case of an arbitrary and systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury. State v. Noell, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 670</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 750 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 902, 96 S. Ct. 3203, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1205 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        For case in which defendant failed to make out a prima facie case of arbitrary or systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury, see also State v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 366</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 585 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant found guilty of murder and robbery failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination, or a violation of this section, in the State's use of its peremptory challenges where the State's questions during voir dire focused on the prospective juror's feelings about capital punishment and the age of the juror, or his or her children, as compared with defendant's age; the venire persons were brought into the courtroom individually, so neither defendant nor the State knew how many black citizens were present in the venire or whether a black citizen would be examined next, and three of the first four jurors seated were black, both defendant and the victim were black, thus diminishing the likelihood that racial issues were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did nor err in denying defendant's Batson challenge to the State's exercising of a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective African-American juror because the State's race neutral explanations for using a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective African-American juror - that her responses on death penalty were weak, that she admitted she might develop sympathy toward defendant, and that she made a misrepresentation on her questionnaire - complied with Batson. State v. Alvarez, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 487, 608 S.E.2d 371 (2005).

        When Exclusion of Class of Persons from Jury Service Will Not Invalidate Indictment.
   
   - Even the complete exclusion, by State law, of a group or class of persons from eligibility for jury service will not make invalid an indictment by a grand jury, selected in accordance with such State law, so long as there is no reasonable basis for the conclusion that the ineligible group or class would bring to the deliberations of the jury a point of view not otherwise represented upon it, at least where the defendant is not a member of the excluded group. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).

        Exclusion of Age Group from Jury List.
   
   - The absence from the jury list of the names of persons between the ages of 18 and 21 during the period from July, 1971, the effective date of the amendment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.009.html#t09a01s9-3" target="_blank">G.S. 9-3</a></cite> lowering the age requirement for jurors from 21 years to 18 years, and September, 1971, the date of defendants' trial, was not unreasonable and did not constitute systematic exclusion of this age group from jury service. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption from Jury Duty.
   
   - So far as the requirements of the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV are concerned, it is sufficient, in order to sustain a State statutory exemption from jury duty, that there is reasonable ground for the legislature to believe that the public interest and general welfare will be better served by the grant of the exemption than by subjecting the members of the exempted class to the duty imposed upon other members of the community. And it is so held with reference to the provisions of this section. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24 are to be so interpreted that systematic exclusion from the grand jury of persons, otherwise qualified, because of their race, requires, upon motion duly made, the quashing of an indictment returned against a member of that race by such grand jury, irrespective of the fact that all members of the grand jury were, themselves, qualified jurors. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion Due to Bias Against Death Penalty.
   
   - Where prospective juror in a first-degree murder prosecution initially responded to both the prosecutor and the court that she did not have any moral or religious convictions against, and could vote for, the death penalty, but she subsequently responded, upon further questioning by the prosecutor, that she would vote against the death penalty without regard to the evidence and notwithstanding the facts or circumstances, and upon further questioning by the court, she was unable to affirmatively agree to follow the law and recommend a sentence based on the evidence and the law and that she would be trying to find ways she could vote against the death penalty and would be predisposed or biased in some respect, the trial court did not err in excusing prospective juror for cause. State v. Jennings, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 579</cite>, 430 S.E.2d 188 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1028, 114 S. Ct. 644, 126 L. Ed. 2d 602 (1994).

        Selection of Grand Jury Foreman by Racially Neutral Standard.
   
   - A method of selecting a grand jury foreman that meets the racially neutral standard must ensure that all grand jurors are considered by the presiding judge for his selection and that his selection be made on a racially neutral basis. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 452</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 834 (1989).

       <p>
        Prima Facie Case of Racial Discrimination in Selection of Grand Jury Foreman.
   
   - A black defendant may make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the grand jury foreman's selection by showing either (1) that the selection procedure itself was not racially neutral, or (2) that for a substantial period in the past, relatively few blacks have served in the position of foreman even though a substantial number have been selected to serve as members of grand juries; the State may rebut such a prima facie case on remand by offering evidence that the process used in selecting the grand jury foreman was in fact racially neutral. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 297</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 622 (1987).
   <br />

       <p>
        Exclusion from Grand Jury on Grounds of Race - Denial of Due Process.
   
   - Arbitrary exclusion of citizens from service on grand juries on account of race is a denial of due process to members of the excluded race charged with indictable offenses. State v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 784</cite>, 42 S.E. 814 (1902); State v. Lowry, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 536</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 870, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, 382 U.S. 22, 86 S. Ct. 227, 15 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1965); State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The indictment of a defendant by a grand jury in a state court from which members of his race have been systematically excluded solely because of their race is a denial of his right to the "law of the land," protected by this section. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 334</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 404 (1958); State v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 495</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 822 (1963).

       <p>
        Racial Exclusion Renders Indictment Invalid.
   
   - An indictment of a defendant by a grand jury from which persons of the defendant's race have been intentionally excluded solely because of their race is not a valid indictment. State v. Covington, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 495</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 822 (1963); State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967); State v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion of Women from Grand Jury.
   
   - Where male defendant moved to quash indictment on the ground that it was returned by a grand jury composed entirely of men and that women had been unlawfully excluded therefrom, it was held that there had been no discrimination against the class or sex to which defendant belonged, and therefore that he could not raise the question of the qualification of women to serve as jurors or maintain that the proceeding constituted a violation of the equal protection guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and by this section. State v. Sims, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 590</cite>, 197 S.E. 176 (1938).

        Section Prohibits Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Under this section, a person cannot be tried twice for the same offense. State v. Mansfield, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 233</cite>, 176 S.E. 761 (1934); State v. Crocker, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 446</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 243 (1954); State v. Birckhead, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 494</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 838 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former jeopardy, being based on the fundamental legal principle that a person cannot be tried twice for the same offense, is a good plea. State v. Partlow, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 60</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 688 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of the Law of the Land.
   
   - It is a fundamental and sacred principle of the common law, deeply imbedded in criminal jurisprudence, that no person can be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense. While the principle is not stated in express terms in the North Carolina Constitution, it is regarded as an integral part of the "law of the land" within the meaning of this section. State v. Crocker, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 446</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 243 (1954); State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372 (1972); State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 191</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 481 (1973); State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 248 S.E.2d 65 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The sacred principle of the common law that no person can twice be put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense has always been an integral part of the law of North Carolina; therefore, the decision in Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784, 89 S. Ct. 2056, 23 L. Ed. 2d 707 (1969), which made the double jeopardy provision of U.S. Const., Amend. V applicable to the several states through U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, added nothing to the law of this State. State v. Battle, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 484</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 641 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition against double jeopardy has long been regarded as a part of the "law of the land" in North Carolina. State v. Urban, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 531, 230 S.E.2d 210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law of the land clause of the North Carolina Constitution, this section, has also been held to embrace the double jeopardy clause of U.S. Const., Amend. V. State v. Cooley, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 268 S.E.2d 87, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 96</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 442 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Guaranteed by Both State and Federal Constitutions.
   
   - It is a fundamental principle of the common law, now guaranteed by the federal and State constitutions, that no person can be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971); State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977); State v. Partin, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 269 S.E.2d 250, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 404</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The common-law principle that no person can be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same offense is now guaranteed by both the federal and State Constitutions. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 191 S.E.2d 403, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 305</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 193 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy applies only to criminal cases.
   
   State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 201 S.E.2d 704 (1973), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 229</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 15 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double Trials and Double Punishment Prohibited.
   
   - A defendant is placed in double jeopardy when he is tried twice or punished twice for the same crime. State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 201 S.E.2d 704 (1973), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 229</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 15 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional principle of double jeopardy is designed to protect an accused from double punishment as well as double trials for the same offense. State v. Irick, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 480</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 833 (1977); State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980); State v. Partin, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 269 S.E.2d 250, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 404</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where multiple punishment is involved, the double jeopardy clause acts as a restraint on the prosecutor and the courts,
   
   not the legislature. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts May Not Impose More Punishment Than Intended by Legislature.
   
   - The double jeopardy clauses of both the United States and North Carolina Constitutions prohibit a court from imposing more punishment than that intended by the legislature. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature May Authorize Cumulative Punishment.
   
   - Where the legislature specifically authorizes cumulative punishment under two statutes, regardless of whether those who statutes proscribe the "same" conduct, a court's task of statutory construction is at an end, and the prosecutor may seek and the trial court or jury may impose cumulative punishment under such statutes in a single trial. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent of Legislature Determines Punishment.
   
   - When a defendant is tried in a single trial for violations of two statutes that punish the same conduct, the amount of punishment allowable under the double jeopardy clause of the federal Constitution and the law of the land clause of our State Constitution is determined by the intent of the legislature. State v. Freeland, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 13</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 35 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy does not prohibit multiple punishments for the same offenses,
   
   where both are tried at the same time, and the Legislature clearly intended them to be punished separately. State v. Strohauer, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 351 S.E.2d 823 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that the defense of double jeopardy is not jurisdictional.
   
   State v. McKenzie, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 170</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 424 (1977); State v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 656, 270 S.E.2d 120 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy is a personal defense.
   
   State v. Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 473</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 657 (1971); State v. McKenzie, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 170</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 424 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden is upon defendant to sustain his plea
   
   of double jeopardy. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally the defense of double jeopardy is raised by a special plea
   
   upon which the defendant carries the burden. State v. McKenzie, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 170</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 424 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Abandonment of Plea of Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Where the defendant fails to plea double jeopardy and to offer supporting evidence thereon, he is deemed to have abandoned such plea. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissal on Jurisdiction Only.
   
   - Where the dismissal, upon defendant's motion, was based solely upon the trial court's ruling that it had no jurisdiction and was entirely unrelated to the sufficiency of evidence as to any element of the offense or to defendant's guilt or innocence, and since there was no acquittal or conviction, a retrial would not offend the constitutional protections afforded by the prohibitions against double jeopardy. State v. Priddy, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 445 S.E.2d 610, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 805</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 751 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        State's Recidivist Statutes Survive Double Jeopardy Challenges.
   
   - Recidivist statutes, or repeat-offender statutes, survived double jeopardy challenges because they increased the severity of the punishment for the crime being prosecuted, and they did not punish a previous crime a second time; the Apprendi and Blakely holdings did not extend to the habitual misdemeanor assault statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33.2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33.2</a></cite>. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 803, 635 S.E.2d 528 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 224</cite>, 643 S.E.2d 15 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Jeopardy Attaches.
   
   - Jeopardy attaches when a defendant in a criminal prosecution is placed on trial: (1) on a valid indictment or information, (2) before a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) after arraignment, (4) after plea, and (5) when a competent jury has been empaneled and sworn. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971); State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372 (1972); State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 159, 191 S.E.2d 403, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 305</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 193 (1972); State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S. Ct. 868, 47 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976); State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 35</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 313 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976); State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clearly established in this State that jeopardy cannot attach until a jury has been sworn and empaneled. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S. Ct. 868, 47 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976); State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 35</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 313 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a nonjury criminal trial, jeopardy attaches when the court begins to hear evidence or testimony. State v. Brunson, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 244</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 860 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Violation After Dismissal.
   
   - Because the State dismissed the charge against defendant after the first trial ended in a hung jury mistrial, defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was violated when he was retried six years later and therefore the appellate court properly held that the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss. State v. Courtney, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 458</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 260 (2019), cert. denied, 207 L. Ed. 2d. 151, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 2948 (U.S. 2020).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Three Situations of Double Jeopardy Identified.
   
   - There are essentially three contexts in which the North Carolina Supreme Court has held that conviction and punishment of a defendant for more than one offense results in impermissible multiple punishment: (1) where a defendant is convicted and sentenced for both felony murder and the underlying felony; (2) where a defendant is convicted and sentenced for two offenses, one being a lesser included offense of the other; and (3) where a defendant is convicted and sentenced for two offenses each arising out of the same conduct, but to which the legislature has affixed two criminal labels, and prosecutorial abuse is evident. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Continuing Offense Precludes Several Violations.
   
   - Defendant's conviction of two counts of keeping and maintaining a dwelling for the use of a controlled substance, where no evidence indicated a termination and subsequent resumption of drug trafficking, was erroneous and constituted double jeopardy. State v. Grady, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 524 S.E.2d 75 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A plea of former jeopardy must be grounded on the same offense,
   
   both in law and fact. State v. Partlow, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 60</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 688 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        To support the plea of double jeopardy, it is of no consequence that the earlier prosecution grew out of the same transaction. It must have been the same offense both in fact and in law. State v. Wiggins, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 441, 204 S.E.2d 692, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 866 (1974); State v. Partin, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 269 S.E.2d 250, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 404</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).

        Evidence Must Be Identical.
   
   - Double jeopardy does not occur when the evidence to support two or more offenses overlaps, but only when the evidence presented on more than one charge is identical. State v. Revelle, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 153</cite>, 270 S.E.2d 476 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant's husband did not fully penetrate 11-year-old victim until his third attempt, each separate act of intercourse was complete and sufficient to sustain an indictment for first degree rape, and no double jeopardy occurred when
   defendant/wife was convicted as an aider and abettor for two counts of attempted rape and one count of rape. State v. Owen, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 516 S.E.2d 159, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 117</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 743 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions for malicious conduct by a prisoner and habitual misdemeanor assault did not charge the same offense, and did not violate the double jeopardy clause; although the conduct alleged in both indictments was identical, the evidence needed to prove both malicious conduct by a prisoner and habitual misdemeanor assault based on an assault of a government employee was different, which meant separate offenses were involved. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 622 S.E.2d 204 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 365</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 188 (2006).

        Prosecution of a Substantive Criminal Offense Following an Adjudication of Criminal Contempt.
   
   - Where the prohibition in a protective order met the legal elements necessary for assault on a female under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33ol1b2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33(b)(2)</a></cite>, the defendant's prosecution on this charge, subsequent to his being held in contempt for violating the protective order, was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause and his conviction for assault on a female was vacated. State v. Gilley, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 522 S.E.2d 111 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions for kidnapping, non-felonious breaking or entering, and domestic criminal trespass did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause where several elements contained within the applicable statutory language were not set out in the subject protective order, the violation of which defendant had previously been held in contempt. State v. Gilley, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 519, 522 S.E.2d 111 (1999).
   <br />

       <p>
        Test for Double Jeopardy.
   
   - The double jeopardy test is whether the facts alleged in the second indictment, if given in evidence, would have sustained a conviction under the first indictment, or whether the same evidence would support a conviction in each case. State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372 (1972); State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test of former jeopardy is not whether respondent has been tried for the same act, but whether he has been put in jeopardy for the same offense. The offenses must be the same both in fact and in law. In re Drakeford, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 230 S.E.2d 779 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The applicable double jeopardy test in an assault case is the "same evidence test," which asks two questions: First, whether the facts alleged in the second indictment, if given in evidence, would have sustained a conviction under the first indictment, the answer to which question is determined by an examination of the two indictments, and second, whether the same evidence would support a conviction in each case, which question looks at facts dehors the indictments. State v. Irick, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 480</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 833 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Additional Facts" Test Explained.
   
   - The additional facts test of double jeopardy is as follows: A single act may be an offense against two statutes, and if each statute requires proof of an additional fact, which the other does not, an acquittal or conviction under either statute does not exempt the defendant from prosecution and punishment under the other. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 248 S.E.2d 65 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a single act constitutes an offense against two statutes and each statute requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not, the offenses are not the same in law and in fact and a defendant may be convicted and punished for both. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980); State v. Partin, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 269 S.E.2d 250, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 404</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of Additional Facts Test.
   
   - The additional facts test is bilateral in its application. The two offenses may have one or more circumstances in common, but in order to constitute either of the offenses sufficiently for prosecution, some additional circumstance must be added. It is the added circumstance which makes each a separate and distinct offense. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 248 S.E.2d 65 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction of three counts of indecent liberties under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa26s14-202.1ol1a1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-202.1(a)(1)</a></cite> for a single episode for touching and sucking a victim's breasts, performing oral sex on the victim, and committing sexual intercourse with the victim did not violate the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, as there were two distinct sexual acts and touch in the single encounter; the indictments each spelled out a separate and distinct fact needed to be proven by the State in order to gain a conviction, and the three acts were distinct acts each constituting the crime of indecent liberties. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 698, 643 S.E.2d 34 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For case espousing a test that includes bad faith prosecutorial overreaching or harassment
   
   aimed at prejudicing defendant's chances for acquittal, whether in the current trial or a retrial, as a standard for prosecutorial misconduct to be applied in assessing double jeopardy claims under the Constitution of North Carolina, see State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 354 S.E.2d 324 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 506</cite>, 369 S.E.2d 813 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Lesser Degree" Rule.
   
   - In determining whether jeopardy has attached, it is necessary to apply tests firmly established by the courts. The "lesser degree" rule states that where the second indictment is for a crime greater in degree than the first, and where both indictments arise out of the same act, an acquittal or conviction for the first is a bar to a prosecution for the second. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 322, 248 S.E.2d 65 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that concurrent, identical sentences are imposed in each case
   
   makes duplication of conviction and punishment no less a violation of defendant's constitutional right not to be put in jeopardy twice for the same offense. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of Double Jeopardy May Be Waived.
   
   - The constitutional right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense, like other constitutional rights, may be waived by a defendant. State v. Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 473</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 657 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's contention that the trial court erred in sentencing defendant to consecutive terms in prison for defendant's two convictions of first-degree sexual offense violated double jeopardy, was not preserved for appellate review because it was not presented to the trial court; in any event, defendant's contention had to be rejected because the sentences were based on separate and distinct acts and did not constitute multiple punishments for a single offense. State v. Gobal, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 308, 651 S.E.2d 279 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 342</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 732 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver May Be Implied.
   
   - A waiver of the constitutional right not to be placed in jeopardy twice for the same offense is usually implied from the action or inaction of a defendant when brought to trial in a subsequent proceeding. State v. Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 473</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 657 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A plea of guilty constitutes a waiver of the plea of former jeopardy.
   
   State v. Hopkins, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 473</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 657 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by denying defendant's request for appropriate relief on double jeopardy grounds given that he waived the right to assert the claim by entering pleas of guilty; because <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1415ol1b3" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1415(b)(3)</a></cite> authorized a convicted criminal defendant to seek relief if the conviction was obtained in violation of the United States or North Carolina Constitution, the trial court did have jurisdiction to consider the validity of that aspect of defendant's challenge to his convictions. State v. Harwood, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 746 S.E.2d 445 (2013), review dismissed, 748 S.E.2d 320, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1016 (2013), cert. dismissed, 752 S.E.2d 486, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1427 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal Waives Protection Against Reprosecution.
   
   - When a defendant seeks a new trial by appealing his conviction, he waives his protection against reprosecution. State v. Britt, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 528</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 644 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of No Contest.
   
   - Defendant waived the right to assert a double jeopardy violation by entering pleas of guilty to obtaining property by false pretense and no contest to accessing computers. State v. Hughes, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 524 S.E.2d 63 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of Former Jeopardy Deemed Waived When New Trial Awarded.
   
   - When, in either a post-conviction hearing or a habeas corpus proceeding, at the prisoner's request, the court vacates a judgment against him and directs a new trial, the prisoner waives his constitutional protection against double jeopardy, and he may be tried anew on the same indictment for the same offense. In such case, a plea of former jeopardy will avail him nothing. State v. Case, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 330</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 509 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only where the accused himself brings about destruction of the first verdict that he can be retried
   
   for the same offense. Where the defendant seasonably abandoned his attempt to destroy the verdict which pronounced him guilty of murder in the second degree, a new trial could not lawfully be forced upon him after such abandonment. State v. Case, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 330</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 509 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        An accused will be protected from subsequent prosecution for the same offense where a valid judgment is set aside by the court on its own motion or upon application of the prosecuting attorney, unless of course the accused acquiesces in the action. State v. Case, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 330</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 509 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If a conviction is reversed for insufficiency of the evidence, double jeopardy precludes remanding
   
   the case for a new trial even if the State has evidence which it could offer at a new trial but did not offer at the trial from which the appeal was taken; however, there is no such impediment in ordering a new trial when the first trial was tainted by mere "trial error." State v. Silhan, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 223</cite>, 275 S.E.2d 450 (1981), overruled in part by State v. Sanderson, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 669</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 133. See also State v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 48</cite>, 490 S.E.2d 220 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of mistrial generally will not support a plea of former jeopardy.
   
   State v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 302</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 78 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both federal decisions, applying U.S. Const., Amend. V, and State decisions, applying common law and State constitutional principles, have recognized that, in certain situations arising in criminal prosecutions, the court may order a mistrial before verdict and again place defendant on trial without violating the double jeopardy prohibition. State v. Preston, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 71, 175 S.E.2d 705 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order of mistrial in a criminal case, entered when the jurors declare their inability to agree, must be left to the trial judge, in the exercise of his judicial discretion, and will not support a plea of former jeopardy. State v. Battle, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 484</cite>, 183 S.E.2d 641 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy clause of North Carolina Constitution, N.C. Const., Art. I, G.S. 19, did not bar prosecution of criminal defendant on felony child abuse charges after her first trial ended in a mistrial when the jury was unable to reach a verdict as dismissal of those charges pursuant to her motion for appropriate relief was improper since the two statutes cited in that motion, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1227" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1227</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1414" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1414</a></cite>, did not authorize the trial court to grant relief under the facts, and thus, required the motion for appropriate relief to be characterized as a pretrial motion that did not bar the State from appealing the dismissal of the charges. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">144 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 548 S.E.2d 554 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test for determining under our state constitution whether a case may be retried after the court grants a defendant's motion for a mistrial
   
   is as follows: If a defendant moves for a mistrial, he or she normally should be held to have waived the right not to be tried a second time for the same offense. Where the defendant makes such a motion because of prosecutorial misconduct, and the court grants the motion, retrial is not barred by this section unless the defendant shows that the prosecutor was motivated by the intent to provoke a mistrial instead of merely the intent to prejudice the defendant. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 506</cite>, 369 S.E.2d 813 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where It Is Ordered for Physical Necessity or Necessity of Doing Justice.
   
   - Even where all the elements of jeopardy appear, a plea of former jeopardy will not prevail where an order of mistrial was properly entered for "physical necessity or the necessity of doing justice." State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A subsequent trial of a defendant, following termination of earlier proceedings upon an order of mistrial, is not precluded by a plea of former jeopardy where the mistrial was granted, over defendant's objections, due to "a physical necessity or the necessity of doing justice." State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Physical necessity"
   
   is illustrated where a juror by a sudden attack of illness is wholly disqualified from proceeding with the trial, or where the prisoner becomes insane during the trial, or where a female defendant is taken in labor during the trial. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Necessity of doing justice"
   
   is not an expression connoting a vague generality, but one that relates to a limited subject, namely, the occurrence of some incident of a nature that would render impossible a fair and impartial trial under the law. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Necessity of doing justice" arises from the duty of the court to guard the administration of justice from fraudulent practices; as in the case of tampering with the jury, or keeping back the witnesses on the part of the prosecution. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test of "necessity of doing justice" does not exist solely for the benefit of a defendant. It is fundamental in our system of jurisprudence that each party to an action is entitled to a fair and impartial trial. State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Limit to Number of Mistrials.
   
   - There is no specific limit to the number of times a defendant may be retried after a mistrial has been properly declared. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 439</cite>, 279 S.E.2d 542 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision to grant a mistrial is a decision will within the trial judge's discretion
   
   when faced with the occurrence of some incident of a nature that would render impossible a fair and impartial trial under the law. State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Under North Carolina law, with the concurrence of the defendant, a judge may declare a mistrial at any time during the trial;
   
   where, after the trial started, the trial court judge discovered that he was familiar with certain aspects of the case, and where defendant did not object to the trial court's order of a mistrial, the mistrial was appropriate, and double jeopardy did not prevent later prosecution. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 609 S.E.2d 423 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of Judge Ordering Mistrial in Capital Cases.
   
   - In all cases, capital included, the court may discharge a jury and order a mistrial when it is necessary to attain the ends of justice. It is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the trial judge, but in capital cases he is required to find the facts fully and place them upon the record, so that upon a plea of former jeopardy, the action of the court may be reviewed. State v. Cutshall, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 334</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 745 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In capital cases the trial court must make findings of fact upon granting a mistrial and place them in the record, so that the court's action may be reviewed on appeal. State v. Shuler, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 34</cite>, 235 S.E.2d 226 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Shown in Capital Case.
   
   - Where the initial declaration of a mistrial during the defendant's first trial on the capital charge against her was not the result of manifest necessity, and therefore was error, and it could not be determined from the record whether the error in initially declaring a mistrial caused the jury to fail to reach agreement after the court had reinstated the jury, and thus deprived the defendant of a verdict, the trial court erred when it later denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the charge of murder in the first degree against her for the reason that she had formerly been placed in jeopardy for the same offense. State v. Lachat, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 73</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Not Shown in Capital Case.
   
   - Imposition of death penalty in the defendant's second trial did not violate double jeopardy or Ring because the jury in the first trial had found at least one statutory aggravator and the jury in the second trial had also found at least one statutory aggravator. State v. Duke, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 110</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 11 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's failure to object to termination of her first trial for capital murder by a declaration of mistrial
   
   would not prevent her from receiving the relief to which she was otherwise entitled on grounds of former jeopardy, on appeal of her conviction at a second trial. State v. Lachat, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 73</cite>, 343 S.E.2d 872 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction Under Federal Statute With Sanctions Under State Statute Held Not Double Jeopardy.
   
   - A conviction under a federal statute followed by disciplinary sanctions pursuant to a State statute for the same conduct does not violate the double jeopardy clause. In re Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 466, 402 S.E.2d 475, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 269</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 832 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement of a guilty plea following correction of an error of law
   
   did not violate the principles of double jeopardy. State v. Oakley, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 99, 330 S.E.2d 59 (1985).

        Parole Revocation Did Not Result in Additional Punishment Within the Meaning of Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Double jeopardy prohibition did not bar a prosecution for failure to comply with sex offender registration, despite the fact that the grounds for this prosecution were the same as used to revoke defendant's parole from a sentence imposed in a separate case. State v. Sparks, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 641 S.E.2d 339 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 181</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 655 (2008).

        Prosecutorial Misconduct Intended to Provoke Motion for Mistrial.
   
   - Where the former trial is terminated by a mistrial granted at the request of, or with the consent of, the defendant, the general rule is that the double jeopardy clause does not bar retrial, even if the defendant's motion for mistrial is made as a result of prosecutorial error; however, where the prosecutorial misconduct giving rise to the defendant's motion for mistrial is intended to goad or provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial, the defendant may invoke the protection of the double jeopardy clause to bar a retrial. State v. Major, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 352 S.E.2d 862 (1987).

       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Not Shown.
   
   - Where each defendant was separately arraigned and pleaded to the bill of indictment, following which the cases were continued to the next term of court, defendants were not twice put in jeopardy by a second arraignment when the cases were called for trial the following term. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 229</cite>, 183 S.E. 286 (1936).

       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Not Impacted by Temporary Interruption.
   
   - Defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy, and was subjected to only one trial, where his trial was temporarily interrupted based upon the unexpected inability of a scheduled witness to be present due to his physical condition. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 35</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 313 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).

        Double Jeopardy Based on Prosecutorial Misconduct.
   
   - Defendant held to have failed to establish his double jeopardy claim under the State Constitution based on prosecutorial misconduct resulting in his request for a mistrial, where it could not be said that the State's case was going so badly and the prejudice resulting from the prosecutor's conduct was so grave that the defendant's choice to continue or to abort the proceedings was rendered unmeaningful. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 354 S.E.2d 324 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 506</cite>, 369 S.E.2d 813 (1988).

         Proceeding with Absent Witnesses.
        </b>
        - Without any evidence that the defendant instigated the State's witnesses' absence, no manifest necessity existed for mistrial purposes and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss; the State's explanation to the judge about not knowing where the witnesses were illustrated that the State knew the witnesses were not present, yet the State proceeded to impanel the jury anyway, thereby assuming the risk of defendant's later plea of double jeopardy.

        Habitual Felon Act Does Not Violate Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Defendant's constitutional challenges to his sentence as an habitual felon failed because (1) the North Carolina Habitual Felon Act was not violative of the Separation of Powers Clause; (2) there was no double jeopardy infirmity inherent in the Habitual Felon Act as applied in conjunction with the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act; and (3) the state appellate court and the state supreme court have rejected constitutional challenges to the Habitual Felon Act based on allegations of cruel and unusual punishment. State v. McIlwaine, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 610 S.E.2d 399 (2005).

       <p>
        Each Fired Shot Separate Offense and Not Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Because the evidence showed that defendant fired seven shots toward the victim's car and that one bullet hole was found in the victim's car, it did not violate the double jeopardy clauses of the North Carolina and federal constitutions to impose three separate sentences for three counts of attempted discharge of a firearm into occupied property or to sentence defendant both for the three attempt counts and for one completed offense. Each shot fired at the victim's car was a separate offense under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-34.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-34.1</a></cite>. State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony that three gun shots were fired in quick succession, each hitting a different location around the front door, and that neither of the guns potentially used were fully automatic tended to show that each of the three shots for which the second defendant was convicted was a distinct time; therefore, second defendant's three convictions did not violate the rule against double jeopardy. State v. Kirkwood, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 656, 747 S.E.2d 730, dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 277</cite>, 752 S.E.2d 487, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 1491 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no double jeopardy violation, as obstruction of justice, unlike accessory after the fact, required deceit and intent to defraud,
   
   and accessory after the fact, unlike obstruction of justice, required that defendant personally assisted the principal who committed the crime. State v. Cousin, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 523, 757 S.E.2d 332 (2014).

       <p>
        Failure to Recognize Merger Doctrine Meant No Double Jeopardy.
   
   - No double jeopardy existed where defendant was convicted of both discharging a firearm into a vehicle and felony murder, because North Carolina does not recognize the merger doctrine. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 659 S.E.2d 73 (2008), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 512</cite>, 668 S.E.2d 564 (2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1215, 129 S. Ct. 1532, 173 L.

        Revocation of Probation Not Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Defendant's revocation of his post-release supervision for leaving his residence without notifying his post-release officer and failing to notify the post-release officer of his whereabouts, and defendant's prosecution for failing to notify the sheriff of his change of address as a sex offender, as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa27As14-208.9" target="_blank">G.S. 14-208.9</a></cite> and in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa27As14-208.11" target="_blank">G.S. 14-208.11</a></cite>, did not violate defendant's double jeopardy rights under either N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   19 or the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. The revocation was not a criminal proceeding and related to defendant's original sex offense convictions rather than the offense of failing to notify the sheriff of a change of address. State v. Sparks, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 181</cite>, 657 S.E.2d 655 (2008).

       </p>
       <p>
        Crimes Against Minor Not Violative of Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy was not violated because none of the elements for indecent liberties with a child and using a minor in obscenity were the same; therefore, defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel for failure to raise the double jeopardy argument. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 43, 671 S.E.2d 53 (2009).

        No Double Jeopardy Where There Was No Final Verdict in the First Case.
   
   - Where a jury wrote a note to the court indicating that it could unanimously agree that minimally the defendant was guilty of second degree murder, but could not unanimously reach a verdict with regard to first degree murder, and the jury was erroneously advised that it must unanimously agree to acquittal of first degree murder before consideration of the lesser offense, a retrial of defendant for first degree murder did not constitute double jeopardy since there was never a final verdict in the first trial. State v. Mays, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 582 S.E.2d 360 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 510</cite>, 588 S.E.2d 379 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 547</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 913 (2004).

   <br />

       <p>
        Each Seized Item of Obscene Material a Separate Offense.
   
   - The trial court did not err by refusing to arrest judgment on defendant's two counts of disseminating obscenity, even though the films sold police were sold in the same transaction, since it was the clear intent of the legislature to treat the dissemination of each seized item of obscene material as a separate offense. State v. Von Wilds, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 362 S.E.2d 605 (1987), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 329</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 873 (1988).

        Final verdict is required before there can be an implied acquittal.
   
   Jury votes on included offenses may be the result of a temporary compromise in an effort to reach unanimity. A jury should not be precluded from reconsidering a previous vote on any issue, and the weight of final adjudication should not be given to any jury action that is not returned in a final verdict. State v. Booker, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 302</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 78 (1982).

        Revocation of Driver's License Cannot Constitute Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Since the revocation of a driver's license is not a form of criminal punishment, it cannot constitute double jeopardy. State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 201 S.E.2d 704 (1973), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 229</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 15 (1974).

State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 202</cite>, 470 S.E.2d 16 (1996).
       </p>

        Order Denying Motion Immediately Appealable.
   
   - A defendant's right not to be unconstitutionally subjected to multiple criminal trials for the same offense is a substantial right, a violation of which cannot be fully remedied by an appeal taken after the subsequent trial has already occurred because the mere fact of the subsequent trial is a violation of the protected right; therefore, where a motion for dismissal of criminal charges is based upon double jeopardy grounds, an order denying the motion is immediately appealable.

        No Double Jeopardy in Conviction for Armed Robbery and Kidnapping.
   
   - Double jeopardy did not result when defendant was tried and convicted of kidnapping for the purpose of facilitating flight following his participation in an armed robbery and of armed robbery, since the intent of the legislature in establishing the punishment for kidnapping was to impose an indivisible penalty for restraint and removal for specified purposes, no hypothetical part of which penalty represents a punishment for the felony which gave rise to the flight of defendant and his removal of the victim, and since the crimes of armed robbery and kidnapping involve vastly different social implications, and the legislature is clearly free to denounce each as a separately punishable offense. State v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 223, 267 S.E.2d 35, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 238</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that defendant was sentenced on both a first-degree kidnapping conviction and a robbery with a dangerous weapon conviction did not violate his double jeopardy rights, as proof of the kidnapping did not require proof of the commission of the robbery itself; further, as the jury had concluded that there was sufficient evidence to find defendant guilty of the separate offenses, the trial court was bound by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa81Bs15A-1340.17" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1340.17</a></cite> to sentence defendant on each conviction.

        Where defendant restrained a victim and prevented the victim from leaving her home by holding onto her shirt and pulling her back from the door before defendant subsequently committed a robbery of the same victim with a dangerous weapon, a separate conviction of defendant for kidnapping, in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa10s14-39ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-39(a)(2)</a></cite>, was proper and not violative of U.S. Const., Amend.

        Double Jeopardy Not Impacted by Multiple Assaults Conviction.
   
   - Conviction and sentence of defendant for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury and assault with intent to commit rape did not subject him to double jeopardy, since the elements for the two crimes are not the same.

        No Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Convictions of statutory rape, taking indecent liberties with a child, and incest, all arising out of the same transaction, did not violate the defendant's rights against double jeopardy; the three are legally separate and distinct crimes, none of which is a lesser included offense of another. State v. Etheridge, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 34</cite>, 352 S.E.2d 673 (1987).

        The crime against nature, taking indecent liberties with a child, and sexual offense in the second degree are legally separate and distinct crimes, and convictions for all three crimes arising out of the same transaction did not place the defendant in double jeopardy.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in imposing judgments of conviction upon defendant for both assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill while inflicting serious injury and discharging a weapon into occupied property; entry of those judgments of conviction did not violate defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy, because the same evidence was not used to prove both offenses. State v. Allah, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 607 S.E.2d 311 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 636</cite>, 618 S.E.2d 232 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no risk of a lack of unanimity where defendant was charged with and convicted of the same number of offenses, and the evidence supported that number of offenses; using the same underlying act to support convictions for both first-degree sexual offense and indecent liberties did not violate defendant's constitutional protection against double jeopardy.

        Burglary and Murder Convictions Not Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Trial court did not err by permitting State to try defendant for both burglary and first degree murder of victim; although the intended felony for the burglary was murder of the victim; since at least one essential element of each crime was not an element of the other, there was no merit in defendant's contentions that he was subjected to double jeopardy. State v. Parks, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 94</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 4 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's burglary conviction did not violate double jeopardy principles where he was also convicted for first degree felony-murder. There was no inconsistency in the jury finding a lack of premeditation and deliberation required for first degree murder but finding the requisite intent to murder to satisfy a burglary conviction. State v. Blyther, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 531 S.E.2d 855 (2000).

        Different Victims Meant No Double Jeopardy Violation.
   
   - Prosecution on two counts of discharging a firearm into occupied property did not violate federal and State prohibitions against double jeopardy even though 3606 and 3608 Jonquil Street were apartments located within the same building; the facts alleged in the second count of the indictment - that the building was located at 3608 Jonquil Street and was occupied by one set of victims, would not have sustained defendant's conviction for shooting into 3606 Jonquil while that residence was occupied by another set of victims. State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 621, 389 S.E.2d 422 (1990).

        No Double Jeopardy in Drug Convictions.
   
   - Defendant's two convictions and punishments for trafficking in cocaine by possession and felonious possession of cocaine, based on the same contraband, do not violate the principles of double jeopardy. State v. Pipkins, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 431</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 360 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Murder and Conspiracy Convictions Not Violation of Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Defendant's conviction for conspiracy to commit murder did not merge into her conviction for murder by acting in concert because the requirement of an agreement, while necessary to sustain a conviction for conspiracy, was not a necessary element for murder by acting in concert. State v. Kemmerlin, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 446</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 870 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional double jeopardy protection was not violated where defendant was convicted of first-degree kidnapping, assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, and maiming without malice because the offenses contained distinct elements not found in the others. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 104, 587 S.E.2d 485 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 158</cite>, 593 S.E.2d 398 (2004).

       <p>
        No Double Jeopardy in Kidnapping and Assault Convictions.
   
   - Where defendant dragged his wife by the hair into the house and then beat her with his gun, defendant's convictions of first-degree kidnapping in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa10s14-39ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 14-39(a)</a></cite> and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-32ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 14-32(b)</a></cite> did not violate double jeopardy under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">

   19; the restraint and removal of the wife, which was the act of dragging her into the house, were separate from the commission of the assault, which was the act of beating the wife with the gun once the kidnapping had been completed. State v. Romero, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 595 S.E.2d 208 (2004).

       <p>
        Murder and Assault Convictions Not Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Trial court did not err by submitting to the jury both attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury, and by imposing consecutive sentences for the offenses, because each offense contained at least one element not included in the other; therefore, defendants were not been subjected to double jeopardy. State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 515 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 909, 125 S. Ct. 1600, 161 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2005).

       <p>
        Kidnapping and Assault Not Double Jeopardy.

State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 515 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 909, 125 S. Ct. 1600, 161 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2005).

        Sexual Assaults Conviction Not Violative of Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Indictments posed no danger to defendant's rights under the double jeopardy clause because, while he was tried for acts of sexual assault that occurred in one county, he was not tried for any acts he may have committed in another county. State v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 631 S.E.2d 868 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 222</cite>, 642 S.E.2d 708 (2007).

        Attempted Murder and Assault Not Violative of Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Even though the offenses arose out of a single course of conduct, defendant was properly charged and convicted of two separate and distinct offenses of attempted murder and assault as to each victim and there was no double jeopardy violation. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 640, 711 S.E.2d 797 (2011).

        Double Jeopardy Shown.
   
   - Trial court erred in sentencing defendant for both involuntary manslaughter and felony death by vehicle arising out of the same death under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-141.4ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 20-141.4(c)</a></cite>, and also erred by sentencing him for both felony death by vehicle under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-141.4" target="_blank">G.S. 20-141.4(a1)</a></cite> and DWI under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-138.1" target="_blank">G.S. 20-138.1</a></cite>, because DWI was an element of felony death by vehicle. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 680 S.E.2d 239 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence presented in support of a 2010 indictment for felony stalking amounted to double jeopardy because the indictment was the same in law as a 2009 indictment, in that the time periods of the "course of conduct" for both indictments overlapped and thus the same acts could have resulted in a conviction under either indictment. State v. Fox, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 721 S.E.2d 673 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy barred defendant's <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-32.4ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 14-32.4(a)</a></cite> assault inflicting serious bodily injury (AISBI) conviction because (1) defendant was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon with the intent to kill and inflicting serious injury, which provided a greater punishment, and (2) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa52s14-392ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 14-3.2(a)</a></cite> barred an AISBI conviction if defendant was also convicted of another offense, based on the same conduct, that provided a greater punishment. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 770 S.E.2d 167 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the original indictment charging defendant with attempted first-degree murder was constitutionally and statutorily sufficient to provide jurisdiction, allege attempted voluntary manslaughter, and was not fatally defective, no manifest necessity existed to declare a mistrial over defendant's objections, the State was barred from re-indicting defendant on attempted murder or manslaughter and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the subsequent indictment. Therefore, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated by his subsequent indictment, prosecution, trial, and conviction of attempted first-degree murder. State v. Schalow, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 795 S.E.2d 567 (2016).

       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Shown in Assault Convictions and Sentences.

State v. Ezell, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 103, 582 S.E.2d 679 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Shown in Robbery and Kidnapping Convictions.
   
   - Since the State failed to show that the removal of the victims was separate from the robbery, that it increased the danger beyond that inherent in the robbery, that the victims were physically injured, or that they were subjected to restraint beyond that of the threatened use of a firearm, defendant's kidnapping convictions were reversed as being in violation of double jeopardy. State v. Ripley, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 617 S.E.2d 106 (2005), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 333</cite>, 626 S.E.2d 289 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Double Jeopardy Shown in Rape Convictions.
   
   - In a case in which the defendant and an accomplice raped a woman, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge of first degree rape by acting in concert with someone else because the jury instruction referred to guilt both as a principle and by acting in concert, which allowed the jury to convict defendant twice for the same crime, in violation of double jeopardy rights. State v. Person, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 512, 653 S.E.2d 560 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In this State a defendant may not be punished both for felony murder and for the underlying "predicate" felony,
   
   even in a single prosecution. Whether in other situations multiple punishments may be imposed when a defendant, in a single trial, is convicted of multiple offenses when some are fully, factually embraced within others is to be determined on the basis of legislative intent. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The offenses of attempted murder and felonious assault are not duplicitous
   
   and the charging of both is, therefore, not double jeopardy; assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill, unlike attempted murder, requires proof of the use of a deadly weapon, and malice is an element of attempted murder, but not of felonious assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 540 S.E.2d 388 (2000), cert denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 396</cite>, 547 S.E.2d 427 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of Former Jeopardy Upheld.
   
   - Where judgment of nonsuit on the ground of variance was entered in a defendant's trial upon an indictment charging armed robbery of a store in which the life of a named employee was endangered and in which money belonging to the store was taken from the named employee, and where defendant was subsequently prosecuted upon another armed robbery indictment for the same occurrence, which alleged that the lives of two other employees were endangered and that the money was taken from the two other employees, and where the evidence in both trials showed that the robbery was perpetrated by endangering and threatening all employees then present in the store, including those named in both indictments, but that the money was removed from the immediate presence of the two employees named in the second indictment, as the same evidence would have supported a conviction in both trials, defendant's plea of former jeopardy prior to his second trial should have been allowed. State v. Ballard, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 479</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 372 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the affray charge upon which juvenile was convicted had as an essential element the assault charge which had been dismissed for lack of evidence, respondent's acquittal on the assault charge barred further petitions based on that charge. In re Drakeford, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 230 S.E.2d 779 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Arrest of Judgment Required.
   
   - Although prosecution of defendants for assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm and for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill did not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy, nor require the State to elect prosecution under a single statute, since each offense required proof of an element which did not exist in the other charge, arrest of judgment of their conviction of the lesser offense was required when they were convicted of both crimes, since assault and the use of a deadly weapon were necessarily included in the offense of assault on a law enforcement officer with a firearm, and defendants could not be punished twice for the same offense. State v. Partin, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 269 S.E.2d 250, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 404</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a defendant was convicted of assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer and assault with a deadly weapon based on the same conduct, and because assault with a deadly weapon by way of a firearm is necessarily included in the offense of assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer, a judgment on both assault with a deadly weapon and assault with a firearm on a law enforcement officer could not stand; the assault with a deadly weapon charge should have been arrested by the trial court. State v. Dickens, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 632, 592 S.E.2d 567 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was reversible error to impose sentences for a first-degree kidnapping and attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon offenses, both of which the jury was instructed could serve as underlying felonies to the charge of felony murder. State v. Oglesby, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 658, 622 S.E.2d 152 (2005), aff'd in part, vacated in part, review improvidently allowed in part, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 550</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 819 (2007).

        Felonious Assault and Misdemeanor Assault Sentences Constituted Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Trial court violated defendant's right to be free of double jeopardy when it sentenced him for both assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-32ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 14-32(b)</a></cite> and misdemeanor assault inflicting serious injury under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33ol1c1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33(c)(1)</a></cite> based on an incident in which defendant punched his girlfriend into a wall and stabbed her multiple times in the arm and leg; because defendant's convictions under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-32ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 14-32(b)</a></cite> provided for greater punishment than <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-32.4" target="_blank">G.S. 14-32.4</a></cite> or 14-33(c), the trial court could not convict and sentence defendant under two statutes for the same conduct in each incident without violating the double jeopardy provisions of U.S. Const., Amend. 5 and N.C.

        Conviction of Breaking and Entering and Weapon Possession by Felon.
   
   - Defendant's prior conviction of felonious breaking and entering was not an "offense" within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause when construed with defendant's conviction of possession of a firearm by a felon; defendant was not prosecuted nor punished again for the underlying conviction for felonious breaking and entering, but was convicted and punished for defendant's subsequent act of unlawfully possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. State v. Wood, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 227, 647 S.E.2d 679, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 703</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 402 (2007).

        Possession and Sale as Separate Offenses.
   
   - For cases holding that possession and sale of controlled substances are separate offenses, and that a defendant will not be subjected to double jeopardy when he is tried for both, see State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 191</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 481 (1973); State v. Patterson, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 443, 204 S.E.2d 709 (1974); State v.

       <p>
        Convictions May Be Had for Breaking or Entering and Larceny.
   
   - The prohibitions in the United States and North Carolina Constitutions against placing a person twice in jeopardy do not prohibit, in a single trial, convictions and punishment for both breaking or entering and felony larceny based upon that breaking or entering. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 444</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 701 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction and punishment for both felony breaking or entering and felonious larceny based upon the same breaking or entering in a single trial is not prohibited by the provisions of either the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of North Carolina. State v. Edmondson, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 187</cite>, 340 S.E.2d 110 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the crimes of larceny and obtaining property by false pretenses are separate
   
   and distinguishable offenses, the issuance of a second indictment for false pretenses, after the dismissal of larceny charges at the close of the State's evidence, did not constitute double jeopardy. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 461, 331 S.E.2d 227, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 187</cite>, 339 S.E.2d 409 (1985).

       <p>
        Robbery defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated
   
   because the fact that the bank's money was obtained from two tellers did not allow the State to indict defendant for two separate armed robberies. State v. Becton, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C.

       <p>
        Multiple Driving Offense Conviction Violating Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Defendant's convictions for speeding, reckless driving, and speeding to elude arrest, aggravated to a felony for speeding and reckless driving, violated double jeopardy because (1) speeding and reckless driving were elements of the third crime, since speeding and reckless driving increased the maximum penalty, and (2) the legislature intended to impose alternate, not separate, punishments, since all the statutes sought to deter the same conduct.

        Right to Counsel Guaranteed.
   
   - An accused's right to counsel in a criminal prosecution is guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. VI and is applicable to the states through U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 and this section. State v. Shores, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 402 S.E.2d 162 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflict of Interest.
   
   - Because defendant did not waive her right to conflict free counsel, she argued that she claimed possession of the heroin and the paraphernalia to protect her boyfriend, and because he was represented by defense counsel's boss, there was a potential for a conflict under N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a); thus, a hearing should have been held. State v. Mims, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 637 S.E.2d 244 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 and 23 were not violated by the denial of defense counsel's motion to withdraw since an inquiry was conducted into counsel's allegation that counsel had a conflict of interest under N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a) because a former client was called as a witness against defendant; there was no conflict since: (1) counsel had represented the witness three years prior to defendant's trial and was no longer representing the witness; (2) counsel had no recollection as to specifics of the witness's case aside from the fact that the witness had been convicted; (3) counsel's statement that counsel would review counsel's file to see if counsel had any information to help defendant proved that counsel was committed to defendant's case; and (4) counsel made significant inroads to undermine the witness's credibility. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 651 S.E.2d 924 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The guarantee of counsel only applies to "critical stages" of the prosecution,
   
   and what constitutes a critical stage is determined both from the nature of the proceedings and from the facts in each case. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 728, 252 S.E.2d 100 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A probable cause hearing is a "critical stage" of the criminal process
   
   entitling an indigent person to appointed counsel if he desires such assistance. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Administration of a gunshot residue test is not a critical stage
   
   of criminal proceedings to which the constitutional right to counsel attaches. Therefore, testimony that defendant refused to submit to the test until she talked to her attorney did not violate her constitutional rights. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 163</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 352, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1981), rehearing denied, 454 U.S. 1165, 102 S. Ct. 1041, 71 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Counsel Includes Reasonable Time for Preparation.
   
   - The constitutional right to assistance of counsel necessarily includes that counsel should have a reasonable time to prepare for trial. However, no set length of time for investigation, preparation and presentation is required, and whether defendant is denied due process must be determined upon the basis of the circumstances in each case. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 251 S.E.2d 647, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 178</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 39 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a continuance where the State, in defendant's attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon case, presented defendant with a statement on the morning of trial that it had obtained from the man who had allegedly sold defendant the gun used in the shootings involved in defendant's case; defendant had not shown evidence that he would have been better prepared had the motion to continue been granted or that he was materially prejudiced by the denial of his motion, and defendant was given a recess by the trial court to allow his counsel to interview the man. State v. Bethea, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 43, 617 S.E.2d 687 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere Failure to Grant a Continuance Is Not a Denial of Effective Assistance.
   
   - Unless counsel suggests the existence of material witnesses or information that would possibly lead to material evidence or material witnesses, the mere failure to grant a continuance in order for the defense to make an investigation would not, in and of itself, constitute a denial of effective assistance of counsel. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prevention of Adequate Preparation by Defendant.
   
   - The conduct of a defendant in failing either to retain counsel or to avail himself of his right, if any, to court appointed counsel, may make him solely responsible for any lack of trial preparation on the part of his counsel. State v. McDiarmid, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 243 S.E.2d 398 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision Not to Introduce Evidence.
   
   - The trial court's deferral of its ruling, on whether introduction of certain evidence by defendant would open the door to permit the State to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial evidence about defendant's prior convictions, did not improperly chill the defendant's rights to introduce evidence; his decision not to introduce the evidence was purely tactical and did not implicate any rights. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 18 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 910, 122 S. Ct. 250, 151 L. Ed. 2d 181 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 854</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 854 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Assistance of Counsel Means Effective Assistance.
   
   - The right to counsel is not intended to be simply an empty formality, but is intended to guarantee effective assistance of counsel. State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 231</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 332 (1978); State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional right to counsel has long been recognized as an entitlement to the effective assistance of counsel. State v. Vickers, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 90</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 599 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test of effective assistance of counsel
   
   is whether the assistance given was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. State v. Vickers, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 90</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 599 (1982); State v. Scober, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 328 S.E.2d 590 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are no set rules to determine whether a defendant has been deprived of effective assistance of counsel; rather, each case must be approached upon an ad hoc basis, viewing the circumstances as a whole in order to determine this question. State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 231</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 332 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Question of failure of counsel to render effective representation
   
   may be considered on direct appeal. State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 231</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 332 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial Judge Better Able to Evaluate Effectiveness.
   
   - The trial judge, who actually sees the lawyer's behavior, is better able than an appellate court to evaluate the overall effectiveness of representation. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Physical Incapacity of Counsel.
   
   - The question of effective assistance of counsel involving the physical incapacity of counsel does not turn on the physical incapacity of counsel as such, since this may or may not deprive a defendant of effective representation. Rather, it is necessary to examine counsel's specific acts or omissions which the defendant alleges constitute a denial of effective assistance. The reviewing court must approach such questions ad hoc and in each case must view the circumstances as a whole. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding defense attorney's hearing disability, his efforts and the assistance of co-counsel were held to have provided defendant with effective legal representation throughout criminal proceedings. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver.
   
   - Defendant was granted a new trial on his indictment for habitual felon status because, despite defendant's dissatisfaction with his prior counsel and clearly-stated desire to proceed pro se, the trial court erred by failing to conduct an inquiry as required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. State v. Watlington, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 716 S.E.2d 671 (2011).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant in a criminal proceeding, whether at trial or in pretrial proceedings, may waive his right to counsel
   
   if he does so freely and understandingly and with full knowledge of his right to be represented by counsel. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Did Not Forfeit Right.
   
   - Defendant did not forfeit his right to counsel, and the trial court deprived him of his right to counsel by denying his request to activate his standby counsel and therefore he was entitled to a new trial, because he twice requested appointment of substitute standby counsel, the trial court instead attempted to complete the colloquy required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>, defendant clearly and unequivocally stated that he wished to waive his right to represent himself rather than waive his right to counsel, and stated no fewer than five times that he did not wish to represent himself at trial. State v. Harvin, - N.C. App.
   - , 836 S.E.2d 899 (2019), cert. granted, 840 S.E.2d 784, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 490 (N.C. 2020), cert. denied, 840 S.E.2d 785, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 489 (N.C. 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court may find that a criminal defendant has forfeited the right to counsel. In such a case, the court is not required to follow the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>, which the court would otherwise be required to do before permitting a defendant to proceed pro se. A finding that a defendant has forfeited the right to counsel requires egregious dilatory or abusive conduct on the part of the defendant which undermines the purposes of the right to counsel and prevents the trial court from complying with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. State v. Simpkins, - N.C.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent egregious conduct by the defendant, a defendant must be advised of the right to counsel, the consequences of proceeding without counsel, and the nature of the charges and proceedings and the range of permissible punishments before the defendant can proceed without counsel. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. Thus, where the defendant's behavior was not so egregious as to prevent the court from proceeding, or to create a danger of any kind, forfeiture of the constitutional right to counsel has not occurred. State v. Simpkins, - N.C.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant had not engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of the right to counsel where his untimely objection, questions, and speaking out of turn for 20 minutes at the start of the proceeding before he was required to proceed pro se, while frustrating to the court, was not so egregious as to frustrate the purposes of the right to counsel. Moreover, nothing in the record suggested that he was rude or disrespectful to the trial court. State v. Simpkins, - N.C.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in determining that defendant forfeited his constitutional right to counsel because forfeiture required egregious misconduct that obstructs or delays the proceedings, and nothing in the record indicated that defendant's difficulty cooperating with his two court-appointed attorneys had delayed or obstructed the proceedings. State v. Patterson, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigent Defendant May Waive Counsel.
   
   - The purpose of the statutory provision for appointment of counsel at public expense for indigent defendants is to put indigent defendants on an equality with affluent defendants in trials upon criminal charges. To deny or to restrict the right of the indigent to waive counsel and represent himself, while permitting the affluent defendant to exercise such right, would be beyond the power of the legislature, as such action would have no reasonable relation to the objective of equal opportunity. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigency is obviously a sufficient basis for classification with reference to the right to court-appointed, publicly paid counsel, but it is not a reasonable basis for classification as to the right to represent one's self. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For case upholding finding that defendant's counsel was not ineffective but if he was, the defendant did not show prejudice,
   
   see State v. Swann, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 666</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 533 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not invoke his right to counsel;
   
   thus, the motion to suppress defendant's statement was properly denied. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 476 S.E.2d 453 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Counsel Held Waived.
   
   - Even though counsel was appointed for defendant, he waived the right to have counsel when he initiated a conversation and volunteered statements to investigators without being questioned; neither his Fifth Amendment nor his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and his statements were properly admitted at his trial. State v. Boggess, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 676</cite>, 600 S.E.2d 453 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional rights to counsel were not violated because the trial court determined defendant elected to proceed pro se as defendant signed waiver of counsel forms and the court gave defendant years to find an attorney, advised and counseled defendant about the right to an attorney including the right to appointed counsel, counseled defendant on the complexity of handling a jury trial, and addressed the seriousness of the charges and advised defendant a conviction likely meant a life sentence. State v. Schumann, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 866, 810 S.E.2d 379 (2018), review denied, 811 S.E.2d 590, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 252 (2018).

        Statement of Defendant Following Arrival of Appointed Counsel Unable to See Defendant.
   
   - Investigators did not violate U.S. Const., amends. VI and XIV or N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 and 23 by continuing to question defendant after appointed provisional counsel arrived at the sheriff's office and requested to see defendant where defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, initialed the form, and did not request an attorney at any time before he made a statement. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 103</cite>, 711 S.E.2d 122 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1541, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 1493, 182 L. Ed. 2d 176 (U.S. 2012).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant forfeited defendant's right to court-appointed counsel
   
   because defendant's failure to hire defendant's own counsel over a period of years resulted in repeated delays in the case proceeding to trial. State v. Schumann, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 866, 810 S.E.2d 379 (2018), review denied, 811 S.E.2d 590, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 252 (2018).

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Did Not Engage in Serious Misconduct so as to Warrant Forfeiture of Right to Counsel.
   
   - Trial court violated defendant's constitutional right to counsel by requiring him to represent himself where he neither voluntarily waived his right to be represented by counsel nor engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of his right to counsel without any warning that he would be required to represent himself or an inquiry under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite> to ensure that he understood the consequences of self-representation. The record showed that defendant was uniformly polite and cooperative, he did not deny the trial court's jurisdiction, disrupt court proceedings, or behave offensively, and he did not hire and fire multiple attorneys or repeatedly delay the trial. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 782 S.E.2d 88 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant had to receive a new trial because he did not forfeit his right to counsel by engaging in serious misconduct or dilatory tactics after having been warned of the consequences as defendant was not combative or rude; there was no indication defendant had ever previously requested the case to be continued; and, as a whole, defendant's arguments did not appear to be designed to delay or obstruct the proceedings but overall reflected his lack of knowledge or understanding of the legal process. State v. Simpkins, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 826 S.E.2d 845 (2019), aff'd, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 98 (N.C. 2020).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ineffective Assistance Not Shown.
   
   - Under the unique and difficult circumstances here, with the already heavily incriminating evidence against defendant, as well as the apparent likelihood that the discovery of further incriminating evidence could be imminent, the attorneys' decision to disclose potentially incriminating information as to the location of the minor victim with the sought-after goal of avoiding imposition of the death penalty did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 797 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to identify anything that one attorney's allegedly inadequate investigation failed to uncover and that would have had any effect on the reasonableness of his attorneys' strategic decision to make the disclosure of the location of the minor victim, which was made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options; ineffective assistance was not shown. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 797 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Illustrative Cases.
   
   - Defendant's contention that the district attorney's argument to the jury referring repeatedly to the fact that defense counsel was from another part of the State constituted prejudicial error and denied the defendant due process and the effective assistance of counsel would be overruled where defense counsel had opened the door with abusive comments attacking the credibility of two State witnesses and the honesty of two local law-enforcement officers. State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 512</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 303, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 912, 97 S. Ct. 301, 50 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of any showing that the withdrawal of a motion to consolidate for trial charges against two defendants in any way prejudiced defendant's case and denied him his right to effective counsel, there was no error in denial of his motion to continue. State v. Minshew, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 235 S.E.2d 866 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for kidnapping and assaulting a policeman with a firearm, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a continuance under circumstances in which the 17 days defendant's counsel had to prepare for trial was not a reasonable time to comply with defendant's constitutional right to assistance of counsel in his defense. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 251 S.E.2d 647, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 178</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 39 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial counsel's failure to move for exclusion of three State's witnesses from the courtroom until each one was called to testify was not evidence of ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 270 S.E.2d 559 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 286 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record did not indicate any impermissibly suggestive pretrial identification procedures that would have tainted the witnesses' in-court identifications, defendant's counsel's failure to object or move for a voir dire examination was not indicative of ineffective representation. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 270 S.E.2d 559 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 286 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defense counsel's failure to move for dismissal on the grounds of insufficient evidence at the close of all the evidence did not prejudice the defendant and did not constitute ineffective representation, because the sufficiency of the evidence was reviewable on appeal without regard to whether a motion was made at trial. State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 270 S.E.2d 559 (1980), appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 726</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 286 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The counsel's substandard performance was prejudicial to the rape defendant where the defense's failure to produce any evidence to support the theories proffered at the outset of the trial, including consent of the victim and inability of the defendant to perform the alleged acts, formed the basis of one of the principal closing arguments made by the State in favor of conviction. State v. Moorman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 387</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 502 (1987).

       <p>
        The right of a defendant accused of second degree murder to have an attorney of his own choosing was overridden by the trial court's interest in conducting a fair and unbiased legal proceeding where the defendant's counsel had previously represented the victim in her divorce and drafted a power of attorney for her signature prior to her death. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 574 S.E.2d 58 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 65</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 572 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        As defendant's denial of his pointing of any gun was inconsistent with the defenses of necessity or justification, defendant's attorney made a tactical decision to present a theory of defense based upon defendant's own statements to police; as such, defense counsel's decision not to request jury instructions on necessity and justification with respect to a charge of assault by pointing a gun could not be ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Langley, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 194, 618 S.E.2d 253 (2005), cert. dismissed, and denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 366</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 447 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to show that there was a reasonable probability that, absent out-of-court statements that his counsel failed to object to, the trial result would have been different. Accordingly, his assignment of error based on ineffective assistance of counsel was without merit. State v. Thorne, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 618 S.E.2d 790 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in permitting defendant to waive counsel and proceed pro se at a probation revocation hearing without first satisfying the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. Nothing in the record or transcript indicated that defendant understood and appreciated the consequences of his decision to proceed pro se or comprehended the nature of charges and proceedings and the range of possible punishments. State v. Sorrow, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. App.</cite> 571, 713 S.E.2d 180 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with first degree murder under the felony murder rule, trial counsel's alleged admissions of fact did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel made the challenged admissions of fact with defendant's consent and defendant expressly consented to counsel's strategy of attempting to persuade the jury that defendant neither intended to kill nor actually killed the murder victim. State v. Pemberton, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 743 S.E.2d 719 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Double jeopardy argument would have been unsuccessful at trial when defendant was convicted of both second-degree rape and statutory rape, predicated on a single act of sexual intercourse with the fifteen-year-old and mentally disabled victim, because neither of the offenses was a lesser included offense of the other based on the separate and distinct elements that had to be proven for each offense. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 652</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 334 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not show counsel's assistance was ineffective for not arguing a warrantless blood draw's constitutionality because defendant showed no prejudice, as (1) defendant could be convicted based on an officer's opinion of appreciable impairment, and (2) evidence of impairment aside from the blood draw was overwhelming. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 802 S.E.2d 566, review denied, 807 S.E.2d 568, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 970 (2017).

        Defendant Is Entitled to Time and Opportunity to Investigate and Produce Evidence.
   
   - Due process requires that every defendant be allowed a reasonable time and opportunity to investigate and produce competent evidence, if he can, in defense of the crime with which he stands charged and to confront his accusers with other testimony. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 690</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 526 (1970).

        Time to Prepare Defense.
   
   - It is implicit in these constitutional guarantees that an accused and his counsel shall have a reasonable time to investigate, prepare and present the defense of the accused. State v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 37</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 335, cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 918, 96 S. Ct. 228, 46 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1975).

       <p>
        Analysis of Evidence by Expert.
   
   - In defendant's trial on a charge of first degree murder, the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for a continuance so she could find an expert to analyze the State's expert's conclusion that there was blood splatter on defendant's clothes which suggested that defendant was present when a victim was struck, and the appellate court ordered a new trial because the State did not carry its burden of showing that the trial court's ruling was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Barlowe, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 578 S.E.2d 660 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err or violate defendant's constitutional rights in denying defendant's motion for a continuance to permit defendant to procure an expert witness to evaluate and testify as to the State of North Carolina's DNA evidence because defendant had sufficient time to review the evidence against defendant and to procure the assistance of an expert, but simply failed to do so in time.

       <p>
        The question as to whether defendant has sufficient time to prepare his defense
   
   before trial is one addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, which will not be reviewed on appeal when it is not made to appear that his discretionary power has been abused by him. State v. Burnett, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 783</cite>, 115 S.E. 57 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        No set length of time for investigation, preparation and presentation of defense is required, and whether defendant is denied due process must be determined upon the basis of the circumstances of each case.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Continuance Held Improper.
   
   - The defendant was entitled to a new trial because the court's denials of his repeated motions for a continuance resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, to confront his accusers, and to due process of law. Defendant's counsels had only thirty-four days to prepare for a complex, bifurcated capital case, involving multiple incidents in multiple locations over a two-day period, which they took over from another attorney who had done little other than filing pretrial motions while trying to persuade the defendant to accept a plea bargain. No evidence existed that any witness interviews had been performed; the orders based on the trial court's rulings on pretrial motions had not been prepared; and a jury questionnaire was not submitted for distribution to prospective jurors. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 119</cite>, 529 S.E.2d 671 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delay Forced by Defendant.
   
   - There was no constitutional violation where defendant clearly had ample time to confer with counsel, investigate, and present his defense.
   Defendant may not force a delay in proceedings by retaining counsel and refusing to agree to a fee arrangement. State v. Cuevas, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. App.</cite> 553, 468 S.E.2d 425 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Offered Insufficient Evidence.
   
   - The circumstances surrounding the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to continue did not demonstrate that it was unlikely that the defendant could have received effective assistance of counsel. The defendant failed to offer evidence tending to establish a violation of his constitutional right to a reasonable time to investigate, prepare and present his defense for murder charge and did not show that he had inadequate time to confer with counsel or that counsel had inadequate time to prepare for trial. State v. Tunstall, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 320</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 331 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Motion for Continuance Presents Question of Law.
   
   - Ordinarily, whether a cause shall be continued is a matter which rests in the sound discretion of the trial court and, in the absence of gross abuse, is not subject to review on appeal, but when the motion is based on a right guaranteed by the federal and State Constitutions, the question presented is one of law and not of discretion, and the decision of the court below is reviewable. State v. Farrell, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 321</cite>, 26 S.E.2d 322 (1943); State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 349</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 389 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a motion for a continuance is based on a right guaranteed by the federal and State Constitutions, the question presented is one of law and not of discretion, and the decision of the trial court is reviewable on appeal. State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 172 S.E.2d 249 (1970); State v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 644</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 551 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a motion for continuance is based on a right guaranteed by the Constitution, the decision of the trial judge is reviewable as a question of law without a prior determination that there has been a gross abuse of discretion. State v. Harrill, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 186</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 325, death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).

       <p>
        Indictment, Arraignment and Trial on Same Day.
   
   - Defendant's indictment, arraignment, and trial on the same day on a burglary charge was not such a flagrant violation of his due process rights that the court was required to dismiss the indictment, since defendant, by not contesting additional indictments for armed robbery, larceny, and rape conceded that he had been given sufficient time in which to prepare a defense on these charges; the burglary indictment arose out of the same series of events which led to the three other indictments; the offenses took place at such a close proximity in time that any defense which counsel might have prepared to the charge of burglary could not have significantly differed from the defenses he did prepare to the charges of larceny, armed robbery, and rape, and any proof of the nonexistence of the essential elements of burglary would necessarily be included in defendant's defense on the other charges in this case, because for each charge defendant would seek to disprove the State's evidence of the sequence of events leading up to the charge, which facts also supported the burglary indictment. State v. Revelle, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 153</cite>, 270 S.E.2d 476 (1980).

        Illustrative Cases.
   
   - Findings in post-conviction proceeding, disclosing that petitioners, although jointly tried, were not allowed to communicate with one another prior to trial, and that there attempts to contact witnesses and friends were unsuccessful, did not support the lower court's conclusion of law that petitioners had not been denied any rights guaranteed to them by this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

   23 and by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. State v. Wheeler, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 187</cite>, 105 S.E.2d 615 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court had determined from evidence of defendant's impaired mental capacity that the interests of justice required that defendant's case be continued in order that defendant could be granted the opportunity to seek compulsory attendance of witnesses and the effective assistance of counsel, the trial court's action in allowing the case to proceed to trial upon defendant's motion for a speedy trial and for leave to withdraw his prior motions for a continuance, where no evidence was introduced before the trial court indicating that defendant's impairments had subsided or no longer existed, constituted a denial of defendant's rights to due process of law and equal protection of the laws. State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">38 N.C. App.</cite> 445, 248 S.E.2d 369 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant made no credible demonstration that a continuance would have enabled him to secure his psychiatrist's attendance, the judge did not err, nor did he abuse his discretion, by refusing to grant a continuance, and even had the judge's denial of the motion been erroneous constitutionally, defendant failed to demonstrate prejudice. State v. Attmore, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 385, 374 S.E.2d 649 (1988), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 248</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 757 (1989).

        Section Preserves Right of Confrontation and Cross-Examination.
   
   - "The law of the land" guaranteed by this section of the Constitution, which is synonymous with "due process," preserves the right of confrontation and cross-examination to an accused in a criminal action. By cross-examination a witness may be questioned as to prior inconsistent statements or as to any act inconsistent with his testimony in order to impeach him or cast doubt upon his credibility.

        New Trial is Not Barred by Death of Defendant's Witness.
   
   - To hold that when a defendant in a criminal action by his appeal has secured a new trial, he cannot be prosecuted promptly again, because by the death of a witness who would testify in his favor, if alive, at the time of the retrial, he would in such trial by such death and loss of evidence be denied the right of due process of law under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and to the rights of "the law of the land" provision of this section, would mean that some, if not many, cases could not be tried again. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 359</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 891 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84 S. Ct. 977, 11 L. Ed. 2d 974 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant by his appeal obtains a new trial, the law does not require that the State in order to prosecute him again must guarantee that all his witnesses shall be alive and capable of testifying for him at the retrial, for to require that would be for the law to exact of the State impossibilities. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 359</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 891 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84 S. Ct. 977, 11 L. Ed. 2d 974 (1964).

       <p>
        Defendant Must Be Discharged If State's Essential Witnesses Are Dead.
   
   - If a defendant by his appeal secures a new trial, and if at the time of the new trial the State's essential witnesses are dead or incapable of testifying, the State has no other recourse than to discharge the defendant, no matter how guilty he may be. State v. Patton, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 359</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 891 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 956, 84 S. Ct. 977, 11 L. Ed. 2d 974 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for separate trial
   
   so prejudiced his defense as to amount to a denial of due process and his right to confrontation where defendant was precluded under the circumstances of the joint trial from introducing evidence of codefendant's out-of-court statement, which would have strengthened defendant's alibi defense. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 372</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 222, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admissibility of Death Certificate.
   
   - Defendant's right to confrontation and his right to fundamental fairness in his criminal trial were violated by admission in evidence of hearsay and conclusory statement in victim's death certificate. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).

        Denial of motion for a continuance to secure the attendance and testimony

        Presentation of Expert Witness.
   
   - Trial court abused its discretion in excluding defendant's expert from testifying about tampering on defendant's computer, as the expert was experienced with the subject matter and was in a better position to have an opinion on the subject than was the trier of fact.

        Defendant Failed to Show His Right to the Aid of a Pathologist.
   
   - Even though defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the crime charged was critical, and the state's case was built on circumstantial evidence, defendant had not demonstrated that a pathologist could have offered anything to his defense where the assistance of the pathologist sought by defendant would have been of little, if any, value to him, and defendant failed to satisfy his burden of showing either that the assistance of a pathologist would have materially aided him in the preparation of his defense or that the lack thereof deprived him of a fair trial. State v. Moseley, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 1</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 412 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1091, 115 S. Ct. 1815, 131 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1995).

       <p>
        Disclosure of Informant's Identity.
   
   - The privilege against disclosure of an informant's identity is based on the public policy of the furtherance and protection of the public interest in effective law enforcement. However, the privilege must give way where the disclosure of the informer's identity, or of the contents of his communication, is relevant and helpful to the defense of the accused, or is essential to fair determination of a cause. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969); State v. Cameron, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 191</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 481 (1973).

   - A witness, including a defendant in a criminal action, is subject to being impeached or discredited by cross-examination. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In cross-examination a witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, may be asked all sorts of disparaging questions, and he may be particularly asked whether he has committed specified criminal acts or has been guilty of specified reprehensible or degrading conduct. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A witness, including a defendant in a criminal case, cannot be impeached by cross-examination as to whether he has been arrested for, indicted for or accused of an unrelated criminal offense. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).

        Burden of Proof.
   
   - Appellant has the burden of showing not only error but also prejudicial error on appeal of trial judge's refusal to allow cross-examination of a witness. State v. Harrill, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 186</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 325, death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).

       <p>
        Illustrative Cases.
   
   - The right of the defendant in a criminal action to cross-examine expert witnesses who have testified against him is a material one, guaranteed by this section of the Constitution, and a denial thereof may not be held as merely a technicality and harmless; nor would this error be cured by the fact that defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine one of these witnesses in refutation of the correctness of the facts upon which his conclusion was based, especially when the other witness was regarded as the most important one. State v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 300</cite>, 121 S.E. 616 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "law of the land" guaranteed by this section, synonymous with due process of law, guarantees to one charged with contempt of court by an asserted willful violation of a restraining order a right, when he denies the asserted violation, to confront and cross-examine witnesses by whose testimony the asserted violation is to be established. Harriet Cotton Mills v. Local 578, Textile Workers Union, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 218</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 457 (1959), cert. denied, 362 U.S. 941, 80 S. Ct. 806, 4 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a continuance did not deprive him of his constitutional rights because defendant was on notice that the victim's wife was a witness he would wish to consult with about his case; defendant's motion for a continuance was not supported by an affidavit and did not describe with any particularity what the wife's testimony would be beyond "exculpatory statements" that would "impeach her own husband and would impeach his credibility."

        Use of Closed Circuit Television in Court Room Held Adequate to Provide Defendant Opportunity to Cross-examine Child Victim.
   
   - Where, in prosecution for taking indecent liberties with a four-year-old child, during voir dire hearing as to victim's competency as a witness, defendant, although absent from the courtroom, was able to hear all testimony, interact freely with his attorney, and through his attorney confront the victim, thereby accomplishing effective cross-examination, the exclusion of defendant did not violate this section or N.C.

Furthermore, the testimony of a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist, who had years of training and experience in providing therapy to young victims of trauma, supported the trial court's findings of fact and those findings of fact, in turn, supported the trial court's conclusions of law.

        The test under the due process clause as to pretrial identification procedure
   
   is whether the totality of the circumstances reveals that the pretrial procedures were so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to an irreparable mistaken identification as to offend fundamental standards of decency, fairness and justice. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 193, 228 S.E.2d 768, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 449</cite>, 230 S.E.2d 766 (1976); State v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Factors to be considered in evaluating the likelihood of mistaken identification
   
   for due process pretrial identification purposes include (1) the opportunity of the witness to observe the defendant at the time of the crime, (2) the witness' degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the witness' description of the defendant, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. State v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 279 S.E.2d 59, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 318</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 390 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Brevity and Reliability.
   
   - Where testifying witness observed defendant during the day, from a short distance, and long enough to notice his unseasonable clothing, the witness's identification of him was not too brief and therefore not inherently incredible, and its admittance into evidence was not violative of his due process rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   23 and 27. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Showups.
   
   - Although the practice of showing suspects singly for identification purposes has been recognized as suggestive and widely condemned, whether such a confrontation violates due process depends upon the totality of the circumstances. State v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 328</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 682 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion to suppress the show-up identification was properly denied as it was not impermissibly suggestive and did not create a substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification, in violation of due process, because, before the alleged robbery occurred, defendant and the other perpetrators followed the victims around in the mall and the parking lot; defendant was two feet away from one of the victims at the time of the robbery; prior to the show-up, the victims gave a physical description of defendant to the police, and defendant matched that description; and, upon approaching the area where defendant and the other perpetrators were detained, all three victims spontaneously shouted that defendant was the robber. State v. Juene, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 823 S.E.2d 889 (2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirements for In-Custody Confrontation for Identification Purposes.
   
   - An in-custody confrontation for identification purposes requires that: (1) the accused must be warned of his constitutional right to the presence of counsel during the confrontation; (2) when counsel is not knowingly waived and is not present, the testimony of witnesses that they identified the accused at the confrontation must be excluded; and (3) the in-court identification of the accused by a witness who participated in the pretrial out-of-court confrontation must likewise be excluded unless it is first determined on voir dire that the in-court identification is of independent origin and is thus not tainted by the illegal pretrial identification procedure. Failure to observe these requirements is a denial of due process. State v. Tann, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 89</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 720 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirements of Photographic Lineup.
   
   - Due process does not require that all subjects in a photographic lineup be identical in appearance, nor is such a lineup impermissibly suggestive merely because the defendant has a distinctive appearance. State v. Tutt, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 615 S.E.2d 688 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Convictions based on eyewitness identification at trial following a pretrial identification by photograph
   
   will be set aside on that ground only if the photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification. State v. Legette, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 44</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 896 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Photo Identification Procedure Used by Principal Did Not Violate Due Process.
   
   - Photo identification evidence did not violate defendant's due process rights where the school principal, who presented the photographs to the witnesses, was not acting as an agent of the State when he conducted the photo identification procedure at the high school; further, the photo identification procedure used was not impermissibly suggestive so as to implicate defendant's due process rights. Because the photo identification evidence was properly admissible, the in-court identifications of defendant by the two witnesses were also properly admissible. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. App.</cite> 225, 715 S.E.2d 896 (2011), review dismissed, 723 S.E.2d 767, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 204 (2012); review denied 2012 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In-Court Identification Upheld.
   
   - When the trial court found and concluded that the in-court identification of defendant by witnesses was not tainted by any outside confrontation, but was based upon identification during the course of the alleged robbery, and this finding was supported by competent evidence, it alone rendered the in-court identification competent, even it if was conceded arguendo that the showup procedure was improper. State v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 328</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 682 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where nothing in the record indicated that the out-of-court photographic identification, which identified defendant as the perpetrator of the crime, was unlawful and impermissibly suggestive, the in-court identification was not tainted by the out-of-court identification. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to seeing defendant's photograph, a witness: (1) gave an accurate physical description of defendant as a short, white, heavyset male; (2) correctly identified defendant's first name; (3) gave an accurate description of defendant's residence, which was corroborated by defendant's mother; and (4) told police she knew of defendant and had seen him at the same convenience store in possession of guns one week prior to the shooting; the witness was able to view the criminal before and at the time of the crime and testified she saw defendant lower the gun after the victim was shot and drive away from the scene. A lieutenant showed the witness the picture of defendant on the night of the shooting, while she was at the hospital with the victim, and the time between the crime and the confrontation was short; thus, the photographic identification was not so prejudicial that justice could not have been done, and the trial court did not err when it allowed the witness to make an in-court identification of defendant. State v. Farmer, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 630 S.E.2d 244 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of a pretrial identification and in-court identification of defendant did not violate defendant's due process rights because the pretrial display made to the witness was not done in a manner as to be so impermissibly suggestive, the witness had sufficient opportunity to observe the man he was identifying, and the descriptions provided to investigators were consistent with later observations in the witness' testimony. State v. Pulley, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 54, 636 S.E.2d 231 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 574</cite>, 651 S.E.2d 375 (2007).

       <p>
        Finding Conclusive When Supported by Competent Evidence.
   
   - A finding that an in-court identification of defendant was not tainted or rendered incompetent as evidence by subsequent unconstitutional showup, when supported by competent evidence, was conclusive on appellate courts, both State and federal. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 478, 197 S.E.2d 35 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admissibility of Photograph.
   
   - Admission of photograph of a lineup including defendant was not violative of his rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23, where the photograph was properly identified and entered into evidence for the purpose of illustrating the testimony of a witness, and although the defendant objected to the questions identifying the picture, he did not ask that its admission be restricted. State v. McKissick, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 500</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 112 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of defendant's motion to suppress a pretrial photo line was proper where none of the five other photos chosen indicated unfairness, nor were they unduly suggestive, and, while the trial court recognized the witness' confusion, it gave weight to a detective's testimony. State v. Tutt, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 615 S.E.2d 688 (2005).

        Inculpatory Statements.
   
   - Cases dealing with a defendant's inculpatory statements project two predominant concerns: (1) that the circumstances surrounding defendant's interrogation do not render his statement inherently unreliable because it was involuntary; and (2) that overzealous officers be deterred from the use of unconstitutional and illegal practices in obtaining a statement from the accused. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 100</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 756 (1972), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).

       <p>
        Court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress in-custody inculpatory statements

       <p>
        Voir Dire Hearing to Determine Voluntariness.
   
   - In this jurisdiction, when a purported confession of a defendant is offered into evidence and defendant objects, the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, hears evidence of both the State and the defendant upon the question of the voluntariness of defendant's statements. The general rule is that after such inquiry, when there is conflicting evidence offered at the voir dire hearing, the trial judge shall make findings of fact to show the basis of his ruling on the admissibility of the evidence offered. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Every statement made by a person in custody as a result of an illegal arrest is not ipso facto involuntary and inadmissible, but the facts and circumstances surrounding such arrest and the in-custody statement should be considered in determining whether the statement is voluntary and admissible. Voluntariness remains as the test of admissibility. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Confession Held Voluntary
   
   - The granting of defendant's request to see his girlfriend and the mother of his child did not render his confession involuntary where the investigators's statements that they would attempt to contact the women were made only in response to defendant's request, where there was no evidence that investigators used the request as an inducement to obtain his confession, where investigators advised defendant that the police had no control over whether the women came to the station, where defendant himself stated that his confession was not thereby induced, and where the request had no relation to relief from the charges he faced. State v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 481</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 326, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1018, 121 S. Ct. 581, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).

       <p>
        Exhibition of Defendant to Jury.
   
   - Defendant was not denied due process of law when he was compelled to exhibit himself to the jury for purpose of allowing police officer to identify certain physical characteristics on defendant's person, since such procedure did not offend the sense of justice implicit in the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and this section, but such procedure was simply a logical extension of the rule that witnesses may testify as to a defendant's physical condition or as to identifying marks on his body. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 266 S.E.2d 824, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 102</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 306 (1980), 450 U.S. 915, 101 S.

Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 467</cite>, 428 S.E.2d 167 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds, State v.

XIV and this section of the North Carolina Constitution is physical restraint that improperly deprives a defendant of a fair trial. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 346 S.E.2d 510 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        While, as a general rule, a criminal defendant is entitled to be free from physical restraint at his trial, unless there are extraordinary circumstances which require otherwise, there is no per se prohibition against the use of restraint when it is necessary to maintain order or prevent escape; what is forbidden is physical restraint that improperly deprives a defendant of a fair trial. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. App.</cite> 807, 571 S.E.2d 274 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant may be physically restrained during his trial when restraint is necessary
   
   to maintain order, prevent the defendant's escape, or protect the public. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 346 S.E.2d 510 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant is entitled to appear at trial free from bonds or shackles except in extraordinary instances.
   
   State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of a showing of necessity therefor, compelling the defendant to stand trial while shackled is inherently prejudicial
   
   in that it so infringes upon the presumption of innocence that it interferes with a fair and just decision of the question of guilt or innocence. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of Showing Necessity for Shackles on State.
   
   - Because of the inherent prejudice engendered by the use of shackles, the rule since the earliest cases has been that the burden of showing necessity for such measures rests upon the State. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule against shackling is subject to the exception
   
   that the trial judge, in the exercise of his sound discretion, may require the accused to be shackled when such action is necessary to prevent escape, to protect others in the courtroom or to maintain order during trial. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judicial Discretion in Shackling Defendant.
   
   - The power to order a defendant to stand trial while handcuffed or shackled calls for a meaningful exercise of judicial discretion. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasons for Shackling to Be on Record.
   
   - When the trial judge, in jury cases, contemplates the necessity of employing unusual visible security measures such as shackles, he should state for the record, out of the presence of the jury, the particular reasons therefor and give counsel an opportunity to voice objections and persuade the court that such measures are unnecessary. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Instruction When Defendant Is Shackled.
   
   - In any case where the trial judge, in the exercise of sound discretion, determines that the defendant must be handcuffed or shackled, it is of the essence that he instruct the jury in the clearest and most emphatic terms that it must give such restraint no consideration whatever in assessing the proofs and determining guilt. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Objection to Shackling Required for Appeal.
   
   - Defendant, while ordinarily constitutionally entitled to appear at his own trial free of shackles, must, when shackling is suggested, object to the proposed restraint, and absent reasonable excuse therefor, his failure to do so will ordinarily preclude the shackling from being an issue on appeal. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test on Appeal.
   
   - The propriety of physical restraints on an accused depends upon the particular facts of each case, and the test on appeal is whether, under all the circumstances, the trial court abused its discretion. State v. Tolley, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 349</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 353 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Court Order to Wear Knee Brace.
   
   - In view of the fact that a knee brace defendant was required to wear during trial did not make noise or jingle and could not be seen by jurors or potential jurors, the trial court did not abuse the court's discretion in requiring the defendant to wear the knee brace. State v. Posey, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 757 S.E.2d 369 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not err in ordering that defendant be restrained
   
   in the courtroom by the use of shackles, where the evidence tended to show that defendant was charged with crimes of violence; he was 29 years old and apparently in good health; other serious charges were pending against him, including an appeal from a conviction the previous week for which he had received a 40 to 50 year prison sentence; only one deputy was available to serve as bailiff and provide security in the courtroom; and there was an outstanding warrant against him charging him with escape from another jurisdiction. State v. Billups, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 607</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 842 (1981).

       <p>
        Punishment When Person Is Without Knowledge of Facts Making Act Criminal.
   
   - It is not a violation of due process to punish a person for certain crimes related to the public welfare or safety, even when the person is without knowledge of the facts making the act criminal, and this is particularly so when the controlling statute does not require the act to have been done knowingly or willfully. Watson Seafood &amp; Poultry Co. v. George W. Thomas, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 7</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 536 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For Petty Offenses Only.
   
   - The due process rule permitting punishment for certain crimes related to public welfare or safety, even when persons convicted of these crimes are without knowledge of the facts making the act criminal, is not to be extended beyond petty offenses involving light punishment nor to any crime involving moral delinquency. Watson Seafood &amp; Poultry Co. v. George W. Thomas, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 7</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 536 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Due Process for Violations of Motor Vehicle Laws.
   
   - The basis for the inclusion of violations of motor vehicle and traffic laws within the scope of the due process rule permitting punishment of persons for certain crimes related to public welfare or safety, even when such persons are without knowledge of the facts making an act criminal, is that (1) the requirement of proving intent or guilty knowledge would make it impossible to enforce such laws in view of the tremendous number of petty offenses growing out of the host of motor vehicles upon the roads, and (2) the punishments for such violations are usually a small fine. Watson Seafood &amp; Poultry Co. v. George W. Thomas, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 7</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 536 (1975).
   <br />

       <p>
        Imposition of Punishment in Excess of that Imposed by Inferior Court.
   
   - Upon appeal from an inferior court for a trial de novo in the superior court, the superior court may impose punishment in excess of that imposed in the inferior court, provided the punishment imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969); State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 111</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 789 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that defendant received a greater sentence in the superior court than he received in the recorder's court did not constitute a violation of his constitutional or statutory rights. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition on defendant of two concurrent terms of life imprisonment

       <p>
        Applicability of Double Jeopardy Provisions.
   
   - Juvenile proceedings in this State do more than merely determine the delinquency of the minor; they may result in severe curtailment of his freedom and, in some cases, in institutional commitment. Although distinctions between juvenile proceedings and criminal prosecutions do still exist, they are sufficiently similar in nature that the double jeopardy provisions of the United States and North Carolina Constitutions are applicable to them. Accordingly, jeopardy attaches to the initial petition once an adjudicatory hearing on the merits is held. In re Drakeford, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 113, 230 S.E.2d 779 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Counsel.
   
   - In order to comply with due process in a juvenile delinquency proceeding, the right of the juvenile to be represented by an attorney must be considered and an attorney must be provided or there must be a proper waiver of his right. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 188 S.E.2d 731, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 28</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 702 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Transfer Hearing.
   
   - Where the district court held a preliminary hearing, determined whether there was probable cause to believe juveniles guilty, and transferred the case to the superior court, in substance, though not in form, the court complied with the requirements of this section. In re Bullard, <cite class="nc_code">22 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 206 S.E.2d 305, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 758</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 279 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Length of Period Committed to Custody of State.
   
   - There is a rational basis for the legislature's disparate treatment of adults and children, and therefore, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007B.html#t7Ba25s7B-2513" target="_blank">G.S. 7B-2513</a></cite> was not unconstitutionally applied to a juvenile in derogation of her equal protection rights, notwithstanding that she was committed to the custody of the state for longer than the period for which an adult could have been imprisoned for her conduct, i.e., unauthorized use of a motor vehicle.

       </p>
       <p>
        Dividing Line Between Police Power of State and Liberty of Individual.
   
   - The police power of the State extends to all the compelling needs of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare. Likewise, the liberty protected by the law of the land clause of the State Constitution extends to all fundamental rights of the individual. It is the function of the courts to establish the location of the dividing line between the two. State v. Dobbins, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 484</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 449 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Any exercise by the State of its police power is a deprivation of liberty.
   
   In re Aston Park Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For What Purposes Police Power May Be Exercised.
   
   - The State possesses the police power in its capacity as a sovereign, and in the exercise thereof, the legislature may enact laws, within constitutional limits, to protect or promote the health, morals, order, safety and general welfare of society. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Changed Conditions.
   
   - In determining the validity of an exercise of the police power, changed conditions as they arise may bring the subject matter in question within the approved testing principle of reasonableness or may remove it therefrom. Southern Ry. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 165 S.E.2d 751, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 465</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 396 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Police Regulation Can Only Be Justified by Public Interest.
   
   - Police regulation of the use or enjoyment of property rights can only be justified by the presence of a public interest, and such property rights may be limited only to the extent necessary to subserve the public interest. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The limit of the police power is the reasonable necessity for the action
   
   in order to protect the public. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a statute is to be sustained as a legitimate exercise of the police power, it must have a rational, real, or substantial relation to the public health, morals, order, or safety, or the general welfare. In re Aston Park Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973); North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973); In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Question of Degree and of Reasonableness.
   
   - Whether a statute is a violation of the law of the land clause or is a valid exercise of the police power is a question of degree and of reasonableness in relation to the public good likely to result from it. North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test of Validity.
   
   - When the exercise of the police power is challenged on constitutional grounds, the validity of the police regulation primarily depends on whether, under all the surrounding circumstances and particular facts of the case, the regulation is reasonably calculated to accomplish a purpose falling within the police power without burdening unduly the person or corporation affected. Southern Ry. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 11, 165 S.E.2d 751, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 465</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 396 (1969).

        Legislature May Make the Doing of an Act a Criminal Offense.
   
   - As a matter of both State and federal constitutional law, legislatures may make the doing of an act a criminal offense even in the absence of criminal intent. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 368 S.E.2d 33 (1988), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 703</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 866, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1100, 109 S. Ct. 2453, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1007 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Zoning regulations must pass a two-pronged test
   
   in order to comply with substantive due process. First, the regulation must be designed to achieve objectives within the scope of the police power. Second, it must seek to achieve those objectives by reasonable means. Whether the means are reasonable depends on their promotion of the public good and their reasonably minimal interference with the property owner's right to use his property as he deems appropriate. Goodman Toyota, Inc. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 306 S.E.2d 192 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 477</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 884 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Owner not Deprived of Due Process Because Nonconforming Use Denied.
   
   - The fact that a lot would be more valuable if devoted to a nonconforming use does not deprive the owner of property without due process of law when zoning regulations are uniform in their application to all within the respective districts, and when the differentiation of the uses of property within the respective districts is in accordance with a comprehensive plan in the interest of the health, safety, morals or general welfare of the entire community. Kinney v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 404</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 306 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The lawmaking authorities may not, under the guise of police power, impose restrictions which are unnecessary
   
   and unreasonable upon the use of private property. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).
   <br />

        The police power does not include power arbitrarily to invade property rights.
   
   Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Method of Implementation of Police Power.
   
   - Although the object of particular legislation may well be within the scope of the police power, the legislation may yet deprive individuals of due process of law if the means chosen to implement the legislative objective are unreasonable. A-S-P Assocs. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 207</cite>, 258 S.E.2d 444 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitations on Use of Private Property.
   
   - The police power of the State, which it may delegate to its municipal corporations, extends to the prohibition of a use of private property which may reasonably be deemed to threaten the public health, safety or morals or the general welfare, and when necessary to safeguard such public interest, it may be exercised, without payment of compensation to the owner, even though the property is thereby rendered substantially worthless. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v.

        The "vested rights" doctrine has evolved as a constitutional limitation on the State's exercise of its police power to restrict an individual's use of private property by the enactment of zoning ordinances; the doctrine is rooted in the "due process of law" and the "law of the land" clauses of the federal and State Constitutions.

        Regulation of Property Based on Aesthetic Considerations Is Permitted.
   
   - Reasonable regulation of property based on aesthetic considerations may constitute a valid basis for the exercise of the police power, depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Previous cases are overruled to the extent that they prohibited regulation based upon aesthetic considerations alone. State. v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).

        Regulation based on aesthetic considerations may constitute a valid basis for the exercise of the police power depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. When other worthwhile objectives are also realized (for example, improvement of traffic safety and the protection of property values) the challenged regulation will be deemed to be within the range of permissible purposes properly achieved through use of the police power. Goodman Toyota, Inc. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 306 S.E.2d 192 (1983), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 477</cite>, 312 S.E.2d 884 (1984).

        Power Is Not Delegable by Localities to Subordinate Groups.

        Test for Regulation of Property Based on Aesthetic Considerations.
   
   - The diminution in value of an individual's property should be balanced against the corresponding gain to the public from such regulation. Some of the factors which should be considered and weighed in applying such a balancing test include such private concerns such as whether the regulation results in confiscation of the most substantial part of the value of the property or deprives the property owner of the property's reasonable use, and such public concerns as the purpose of the regulation and the manner of achieving a permitted purpose. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Aesthetic regulations may provide corollary benefits to the general community such as protection of property values, promotion of tourism, indirect protection of health and safety, preservation of the character and integrity of the community, and promotion of the comfort, happiness, and emotional stability of area residents. Such corollary community benefits would be factors to be considered in balancing the public interests in regulation against the individual property owner's interest in the use of his property free from regulation. The test focuses on the reasonableness of the regulation by determining whether the aesthetic purpose to which the regulation is reasonably related outweighs the burdens imposed on the private property owner by the regulation. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinance is a reasonable use of the police power if the aesthetic purpose outweighs the burdens imposed on the private property owner. Goodman Toyota, Inc. v.

        Demolition of House for Nonconformity with City Housing Code.
   
   - An action by a municipality, pursuant to an ordinance adopted under the authority of former G.S. 160-182, in ordering the demolition of a dwelling house without compensation to the owner thereof, and in charging the expense of demolition to the owner upon his failure to demolish the house himself, such action being based upon findings by the city building inspector that the house was unfit for human habitation and that the repairs necessary to bring the house into conformity with the housing code would cost 60% or more of the present value of the house, was violative of the Constitution of this State, where (1) the house could be repaired so as to comply with the housing code, and (2) the owner was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to repair the house. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it appears from the findings of a city housing commission that a house can be repaired so as to comply with the city's housing code, be suitable for human habitation and be no longer a threat to public health, safety, morals or general welfare, to require its destruction without giving the owner a reasonable opportunity thus to remove the existing threat to the public health, safety and welfare is arbitrary and unreasonable. Such power may not be delegated to or exercised by a municipal corporation of this State by reason of this section. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).

       <p>
        A homeowner who is faced with a municipal housing inspector's order giving him no alternative but to demolish his home, which has been declared uninhabitable by the municipality, or to pay the expense of a demolition by the municipality, is not required to propose an alternative remedy for the condition of the house before asserting his constitutional right in the courts. Horton v. Gulledge, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 353</cite>, 177 S.E.2d 885 (1970), overruled on other grounds in State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 520</cite>, 290 S.E.2d 675 (1982).

        Test to Determine Whether Taking Has Occurred.
   
   - The test to determine whether a taking of private property for public use has occurred involves as two-part analysis. An "ends-means" test is applied to decide whether that particular exercise of the police power was legitimate, by determining whether the ends sought, i.e., the object of the legislation, is within the scope of the power, and then whether the means chosen to regulate are reasonable. Finch v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 352</cite>, 384 S.E.2d 8, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 714</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 452 (1989).

        Power of Eminent Domain Is Inherent in Sovereignty.
   
   - The power of eminent domain, that is, the right to take private property for public use, is inherent in sovereignty. This section requires payment of fair compensation for the property so taken. This is the only limitation imposed on sovereignty with respect to taking. Town of Morganton v. Hutton &amp; Bourbonnais Co., <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 531</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 111 (1960).

       </p>
       <p>
        The right to take private property for public use exists independently of constitutional provisions. In fact, such provisions are limitations on the State's power to exercise the right. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Hagins, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 220</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 391 (1962).

        Public and Private Roads Distinguished.
   
   - Although a road may be called a public road by the governmental agency which builds it, if, in reality, it is by its very nature and location to be used only by one family or corporation, save for occasional incidental use by visitors, it is not a public road, and the property of another person cannot be taken for its construction under the power of eminent domain. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Thornton, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 227</cite>, 156 S.E.2d 248 (1967), commented on in 46 N.C.L. Rev. 663 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A road used by large numbers of people to reach their place of employment and by many others to reach the place at which they will transact business cannot be said to be a private road for the sole benefit of the proprietor whose plant is located at its terminus. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Thornton, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 227</cite>, 156 S.E.2d 248 (1967), commented on in 46 N.C.L. Rev. 663 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Town's condemnation action was properly dismissed because property owners showed the action served no public benefit, as (1) the action would not "open" a street, since the street had not been closed, as access to the street was never blocked, and other portions of the street were not public, especially when the property was at the end of a dead-end street, (2) condemnation would not provide neighbors' access to land, utility service provider access, fire fighters' access to water, or general community interconnectedness, and (3) the evidence showed the town was motivated by considerations irrelevant to the public benefit. Town of Matthews v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 584, 771 S.E.2d 328 (2015).

       <p>
        Economic benefits to the community,
   
   anticipated from the attraction to it of a large and wealthy prospective employer, are not determinative of whether property taken in order to accomplish that purpose is taken for a "public use." The home or other property of a poor man cannot be taken from him by eminent domain and turned over to the private use of a wealthy individual or corporation merely because the latter may be expected to spend more money in the community, even though he or it threatens to settle elsewhere if this is not done. This the Constitution forbids. State Hwy. Comm'n v. Thornton, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 227</cite>, 156 S.E.2d 248 (1967), commented on in 46 N.C.L. Rev. 663 (1968).

        Property May Not Be Taken for Unlawful Purpose.
   
   - The land of a person may not be taken, without his consent, when the purpose, which would otherwise authorize the taking, cannot be accomplished as a matter of law. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a county to take land from the owners without their consent for a use incidental to a proposed airport, which airport the county may not lawfully construct and operate, would be a vain and utterly useless deprivation of the landowners' rights in their property, and such an arbitrary, capricious taking of their land would be a violation of this section. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).

        Limitation on Use of Property Taken.
   
   - A sanitary district acting under statute to acquire easements to construct and maintain sanitary sewer lines can use the property taken for only the limited purpose described in the petition, and any other use by it or anyone else would require additional compensation. North Asheboro-Central Falls San. Dist. v. Canoy, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 749</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 577 (1960).

        Just Compensation Is Required When Private Property Is Taken.
   
   - Private property may not be taken even for a public use without compensation. McKinney v. Deneen, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 540</cite>, 58 S.E.2d 107 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional prohibitions against the taking of private property except by due process of law preclude the legislature from sanctioning the taking of a person's property except in satisfaction of a legal obligation or for a public purpose upon the payment of just compensation. In re Kenan, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 1</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 85 (1964).

        As Part of the Law of the Land.
   
   - The principle that when private property is taken for public use just compensation must be paid is deeply imbedded in constitutional law, and while the principle is not stated in express terms in the State Constitution, it is regarded as an integral part of "the law of the land." Eller v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 584</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 144 (1955); Sale v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub.

        The principle forbidding the taking of private property for public use without just compensation is so grounded in natural equity that it has never been denied to be a part of the law of North Carolina. Yancey v. North Carolina State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 106</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 256 (1942).

       <p>
        North Carolina does not have an express constitutional provision against the taking of private property for public use without the payment of just compensation. However, North Carolina recognizes this fundamental right to just compensation as so grounded in natural law and justice that it is part of the fundamental law of the State, and imposes upon a governmental agency taking private property for public use a correlative duty to make just compensation to the owner of the property taken. This principle is considered in North Carolina as an integral part of "the law of the land" within the meaning of this section. DeBruhl v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 671</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 229 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the exercise of the power of eminent domain, private property may be taken only for a public purpose, or more properly speaking, a public use, upon payment of just compensation. This principle is so grounded in natural equity that it has never been denied to be an essential part of "the law of the land" within the meaning of this section. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Security Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 595</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 688 (1960).

        North Carolina is the only state in the nation that does not have an express constitutional provision against the "taking" or "damaging" of private property for public use

        There is a fundamental right to just compensation, grounded in natural law and justice, that is part of the fundamental law of this State, which imposes upon a governmental agency taking private property for public use the duty to make just compensation to the owner of the property taken.

This principle is considered in North Carolina as an integral part of the law of the land within the meaning of this section.

        Requirement Is Self-Executing.
   
   - The constitutional prohibition against taking the private property of a citizen for public use without the payment of just compensation is self-executing and is not subject to impairment by legislation.

       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional prohibition against taking or damaging private property for public use without just compensation is self-executing, and neither requires any law for its enforcement nor is susceptible of impairment by legislation. Midgett v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 241</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 599 (1963), overruled on other grounds in Lea Co. v.

        While this State does not have an express constitutional provision against the "taking" or "damaging" of private property for public use without payment of just compensation, recovery is allowed for a taking on constitutional as well as on common law principles.

       </p>
       <p>
        The prohibition against the taking of private property for a public use without just compensation is self-executing, and when no statute provides a procedure to recover compensation under the circumstances of the taking, the owner may maintain an action to obtain just compensation therefor.

   19 does not expressly prohibit taking property without compensation, this right is nevertheless considered a part of the "law of the land" under the amendment. Armstrong v.

       <p>
        Governmental Immunity Not a Defense to Liability for Compensation.
   
   - If a "taking" has occurred, it is compensable, even though it results from a function which is governmental in nature. Governmental immunity is not a defense where there is a "taking" of private property for public use, whether that use is proprietary or governmental in nature. The test of liability is whether, notwithstanding its acts are governmental in nature and for a lawful public purpose, the municipality's acts amount to a partial taking of private property. If so, just compensation must be paid. Long v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 187</cite>, 293 S.E.2d 101 (1982).

        Rejection of Property After Taking.
   
   - To permit the Highway Commission (now Department of Transportation) to decide, subsequent to a taking, that it did not want the property it had taken, and for that reason to refuse to pay, would do violence to the provisions of this section. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. York Indus. Center, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 230</cite>, 139 S.E.2d 253 (1964).

       <p>
        Damages for Delay in Payment.
   
   - Petitioners, whose property had been taken for public use by an agency of the State government, and who had been physically dispossessed and ejected therefrom by a court order, were entitled to have the jury award them as compensation not only the fair market value of their property as of the date of the taking, but also some additional sum for the substantial delay in the payment of the fair market value of their property so taken, as an element of the just compensation guaranteed by this section. DeBruhl v. State Hwy. &amp; Pub. Works Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 671</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 229 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the taking of property by the State precedes the payment of compensation, the owner is entitled to additional compensation for the delay in payment. This section and U.S. Const., Amends. V and XIV require this additional payment as a part of just compensation. The additional sum awarded for delay in payment of the value for the property taken is not interest eo nomine, but interest is a fair means for measuring the amount to be arrived at of such additional sums. Lea Co. v. North Carolina Bd. of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 254</cite>, 345 S.E.2d 355 (1986), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 697</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 866, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1100, 109 S.

        Substitute condemnation
   
   is a transaction in which the State or an agency with the power of eminent domain, A, takes land under an agreement to compensate its owner, B, with land to be taken in condemnation proceedings from a third person, C, instead of with money. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).

       <p>
        There is no denial of due process or other constitutional infirmity in substitute condemnations
   
   where the owner of the land first taken, with whom the ultimate condemnee's land is to be exchanged, also has the power of condemnation and could itself have condemned the land. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Use and Necessity in Substitute Condemnation.
   
   - In controversies concerning substitute condemnation, the questions of public use and necessity are inseparable. Whether land has been taken for a public use in a substitute condemnation will depend on whether fairness requires that B, whose land has been taken for an undisputed public purpose, be compensated in land and whether there is a close factual connection between the taking of B's land and C's land, taken to compensate B. Whether it is necessary to exercise the power of eminent domain will turn on whether B can be fairly compensated only in land. Whether it is necessary to take C's property depends on whether there is a close factual connection between the two takings. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substitute condemnation is a valid exercise of a power of eminent domain only when the substitution of other property is the sole method by which the owner of land taken for public use can be justly compensated, and the practical problems resulting from the taking can be solved. It can only be justified when the property for which land is substituted accomplishes the public purpose for which it was taken, and the cost is not disproportionate to the benefit derived. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n v. Farm Equip. Co., <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 459</cite>, 189 S.E.2d 272 (1972).

        A requirement of dedication of park space for subdivision

   - Section 105-116 (now repealed) taxed billings for electrical service rendered by cooperatives in the same manner as billings for service rendered by investor-owned utilities; therefore, application of that section to electric cooperative did not violate that entity's rights under this section or N.C.

        Flow of Sewage onto Land.
   
   - Where sewage disposal device operated by school board was constructed and operated so as to cause sewage to flow or seep onto plaintiffs' land, and by reason of such continuous pollution and the noxious odors emanating continuously therefrom, plaintiffs' spring was rendered unfit for use and their dwelling was rendered unfit for habitation, there was a taking by the school board to the extent of the impairment in value of plaintiffs' land caused thereby.

        Easements for Sewer Lines.
   
   - When a sanitary district, in the exercise of its power of eminent domain, took easements and rights-of-way for sewer lines over the lands of defendants, it became obligated by the North Carolina Constitution and by the statute under which it acted to pay to defendants just compensation for the damage done. North Asheboro-Central Falls San. Dist. v. Canoy, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 749</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 577 (1960).

        Relocation of Easement.
   
   - Where no written contract existed regarding an easement's relocation and city council had not authorized this relocation, the appellate court took jurisdiction, even though defendants failed to file a timely appeal and found that placement of a sewer line outside an easement constituted a taking as a matter of law.

       <p>
        Flooding of Land.
   
   - The right to have water flow in the direction provided by nature is a property right, and if such right of a landowner is materially interfered with so that his land is flooded by the manner in which a highway is constructed, it is a nuisance and a taking of property for public use for which compensation must be paid. Midgett v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 241</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 599 (1963), overruled on other grounds in Lea Co. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly granted summary judgment to a city on property owners' inverse-condemnation claims because a single instance of temporary flooding of the owners' properties without the possibility of recurrence did not constitute a taking for purposes of an inverse-condemnation claim; it could not be said the city's installation of water pipes was intended to flood the owners' properties or that the flooding was a foreseeable direct or natural result at the time of the pipes' installation.

       <p>
        Substitution of Service Road for Direct Access.
   
   - Since the substitution of a service road for direct access theretofore enjoyed by an abutting property owner is an exercise of the police power, any diminution in the value of petitioners' property is damnum absque injuria. Moses v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 316</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 664, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 930, 85 S. Ct. 327, 13 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1964).

        Construction of Barricade Across Street.
   
   - Where the State has authorized the construction of a barricade across a street, thereby closing it to vehicular traffic in one direction, the owner of land abutting the street on the cul-de-sac thus created has not been deprived of his property without due process of law in violation of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV or this section, though the value of his property has been impaired and the State has not compensated him for such loss of value. Wofford v. North Carolina State Hwy.

        Taking of Land to Increase Highway Visibility.
   
   - If, in the interest of public safety at an intersection of highways, greater visibility is required than is afforded by removing obstructions from existing rights-of-way, land necessary to afford such increased view of approaches to the intersection may be taken by the appropriate public authorities under the power of eminent domain, with just compensation for the land so taken paid to the property owner; but the property may not be taken for such purpose, without compensation, under the guise of a regulation of the owner's business pursuant to the police power.

        Classifications for Tax Purposes.
   
   - The legislature may levy a sales tax or a tax on the business of selling tangible personal property, levied as a license or privilege tax, and classify trades, callings, and occupations for the imposition of a tax, and classify articles sold as the basis for computing the tax, exempting certain classes of articles and providing a graduated tax as to other classes of articles, or differentiate in the method of collecting the tax as to some of the classes, provided the levy applies equally and uniformly to all who fall within each particular classification, and provided the classifications are reasonable and based upon some real distinction.

        A sales tax on retailers who sell merchandise through vending machines,
   
   including items sold for less than ten cents where it is impossible to recoup the tax from the purchaser, does not violate constitutional provisions relating to due process and equal protection. Fisher v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 737, 190 S.E.2d 663 (1972).

        Statute Providing for Service of Summons by Publication.
   
   - A statute conferring jurisdiction upon the superior courts of the counties over citizens and owners of taxable property within the county without requiring each such owner or citizen to be named as a party in the complaint or summons, and providing for service of summons by publication, did not violate this section. Castevens v. Stanly County, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 642</cite>, 191 S.E. 739 (1937).

       </p>
       <p>
        Assessments Without Notice Are Void.
   
   - Street assessments made under charter provisions failing to provide notice and an opportunity to be heard to those assessed are void as violating due process of law, and may not be validated by curative acts of the legislature.

       <p>
        Taxing of One District to Benefit Another.
   
   - It is a fundamental principle in the law of taxation that taxes may only be levied for public purposes and for the benefit of the public on whom they are imposed. To lay these burdens upon one district for benefits appertaining solely to another is in clear violation of established principles of right and contrary to the express provision of this section, which forbids that any person shall be disseized of his freehold liberties and privileges or in any manner deprived of his life, liberty or property but by the law of the land. Commissioners of Johnston County v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 141</cite>, 93 S.E. 482 (1917); Hinton v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 496</cite>, 137 S.E. 669 (1927); Board of Comm'rs v. Hanchett Bond Co., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 137</cite>, 138 S.E. 614 (1927).

        Free or reduced telephone service to municipalities constitutes a tax prohibited by law,
   
   and is discriminatory both as between towns which are similarly situated and as between those towns and individual rate payers living in towns or in the country. Hence, former G.S. 160-281.2 was unconstitutional because it offended the due process provisions of both the State and federal Constitutions, because it was not a uniform tax, because it interfered with vested rights, and because it was an attempt to surrender the police power of the State. State ex rel. North Carolina Util. Comm'n v. City of Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 640</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 786 (1960).

        Tax Statute Held Invalid.
   
   - An act which permits the governing board of a town to list, value and revalue all property without providing for notice and hearing as to such valuations and without setting up precise standards for evaluation contravenes due process of law and is unconstitutional.

        Taxation of Trust Income.
   
   - Court of Appeals properly affirmed the North Carolina Business Court's grant of summary judgment in favor of a family trust because allowing taxation of trust income violated the due process requirements of the state and federal constitutions where the trust did not have sufficient minimum contacts with the State and due process was not satisfied solely from the beneficiaries' contacts with North Carolina since the trust and the trust's beneficiaries were separate legal entities. Kimberley Rice Kaestner 1992 Family Trust v. N.C. Dep't of Revenue, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 463, 790 S.E.2d 339 (2018), aff'd, 139 S. Ct. 2213, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 4198 (2019).

        Sale of Land for Taxes.
   
   - For a valid sale of land for taxes, the tax list and notice of sale must contain a sufficiently definite description of the land to allow the land to be identified, and to constitute notice to those persons whose interest is to be affected, and if the description is not so definite, a sale thereunder will be void as not complying with the statute, as taking property without giving notice, and as not affording those whose property is sold an opportunity to be heard.

        Municipal Tax to Finance Extended Water and Sewer Facilities Prior to Annexation.
   
   - A municipal corporation may issue bonds and levy taxes to pay principal and interest thereon and use the proceeds to finance the extension of water and sewer facilities into an area to be annexed at a fixed future date after the residents of the area to be annexed have approved the annexation and the citizens of the municipality have approved both the annexation and the issuance of bonds. Such bonds are for a public purpose, and the tax imposed within the municipality prior to annexation does not deprive the taxpayers of the city of property without due process of law. Thomasson v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 84</cite>, 105 S.E.2d 416 (1958).

        Action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by minors who were, or would be in the future, enrolled in public schools in the county, and their parents or legal guardians, alleging that the present statutory system of financing public schools in this State resulted in inequities in educational programs and facilities between the public schools within that county, which had a relatively low tax base from which to draw funds, and those in other counties with relatively high tax bases, and that the operation of five separate school systems in that county prohibited effective use of facilities and staff and promoted inequitable use of state and local funds, thus depriving them of equal opportunity to a free public school education in violation of this section, N.C.

        Eligibility for In-State Tuition.
   
   - A person's right to eligibility for in-state tuition is quite different from his basic constitutional right to travel freely from one state to another or his basic constitutional right to vote. Moreover, the regulations of the Board of Trustees of The University of North Carolina concerning eligibility for in-state tuition do not impede interstate travel. And since they do not relate to basic constitutional rights, such regulations are to be tested by the less stringent traditional equal protection standards, that test being whether the regulations have tended in general to assure that only North Carolina citizens get the benefit of in-state tuition, which the regulations have done. Glusman v. Trustees of Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 629</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 213 (1972), vacated on other grounds, 412 U.S. 947, 93 S. Ct. 2999, 37 L. Ed. 2d 999 (1973).

         Reemployment of Teachers.

        - Those connected with school administration, including county boards of education and school principals, must act in good faith and not arbitrarily, capriciously or without just cause and must not be activated by selfish motives in deciding which teachers to reemploy for a school term. Wall v. Stanly County Bd. of Educ., 259 F. Supp. 238 (M.D.N.C. 1966), rev'd on other grounds, 378 F.2d 275 (4th Cir. 1967).

        The right to work and to earn a livelihood
   
   is a property right that cannot be taken away except under the police power of the State in the paramount public interest for reasons of health, safety, morals, or public welfare. In re Aston Park Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff ex-county health director failed to demonstrate that his due process rights were violated where four of the members of the Board of Health (the body which made the final decision to fire him) testified before an administrative law judge who was reviewing his dismissal; the court reasoned that such testimony, even if it revealed another's malfeasance, was not indicative, much less proof, of bias. Simpson v. Macon County, 132 F. Supp. 2d 407 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Historically and fundamentally, the constitutional guaranties of individual liberty protect the individual in the selection and pursuit of the ordinary occupations against the unwarranted invocation of the police power. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 746</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 854, 128 A.L.R. 658 (1940).
       </p>

        This section guarantees the right to pursue ordinary and simple occupations free from governmental regulation. North Carolina Real Estate Licensing Bd. v. Aikens, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 8, 228 S.E.2d 493 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to work and earn a livelihood is a property right, considered fundamental under the North Carolina Constitution; consequently, regulation of otherwise lawful occupations and businesses must be based on some distinguishing feature in the business itself or in the manner in which it is ordinarily conducted, the natural and probable consequence of which, if unregulated, is to produce substantial injury to the public peace, health, or welfare. Poor Richard's, Inc. v. Stone, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 137, 356 S.E.2d 828 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 61</cite>, 366 S.E.2d 697 (1988).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Licensing of Detectives.
   
   - The regulation of persons eligible to become licensed private detectives and commissioned special policemen is an exercise of authority in the interest of the general public, rather than a particular class. North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suspension of License.
   
   - The availability of prompt postsuspension review, along with a relatively brief suspension period, reduces the weight of the private interest in a suspended attorney's continued use of his or her law license pending the outcome of the postsuspension hearing. In re Lamm, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 448 S.E.2d 125 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 196</cite>, 458 S.E.2d 921 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The procedure contained in this rule, provides for independent judicial review by a superior court judge, who must determine if the affidavits and petition establish a sufficient showing to justify a suspension and this procedure satisfies the requirements for sufficient process under the Law of the Land Clause of the North Carolina Constitution. In re Lamm, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 448 S.E.2d 125 (1994), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 196</cite>, 458 S.E.2d 921 (1995).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Engage in Lawful Business.
   
   - When the State's exercise of its police power works to deny a person, association or corporation the right to engage in a business which is otherwise lawful, such deprivation of liberty requires a substantially greater likelihood of benefit to the public in order to enable it to survive an attack based upon this section. North Carolina Ass'n of Licensed Detectives v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 195 S.E.2d 357 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        To deny a person, association or corporation the right to engage in a business which is otherwise lawful is a far greater restriction upon his or its liberty than to deny the right to charge in that business whatever prices the owner sees fit to charge for service. Consequently, such a deprivation of liberty requires a substantially greater likelihood of benefit to the public in order to enable it to survive an attack based upon this section. In re Aston Park Hosp., <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 542</cite>, 193 S.E.2d 729 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Freedom to contract and engage in a lawful business activity are rights guaranteed by the State and federal constitutions.
   
   However, these rights are not absolute, and limitations thereon imposed by the legislature are not violative of constitutional provisions so long as they are reasonable in light of the purposes to be accomplished. Louchheim, Eng &amp; People, Inc. v. Carson, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 299, 241 S.E.2d 401 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Freedom to contract
   
   is both a liberty and a property right within the protection of the due process clauses of the federal Constitution and this section. See Morris v. Holshouser, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 293</cite>, 17 S.E.2d 115, 137 A.L.R. 733 (1941), discussing an employee's right to assign future wages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Freedom of contract, unless contrary to public policy or prohibited by statute, is a fundamental right included in our constitutional guaranties. Muncie v. Travelers Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 74</cite>, 116 S.E.2d 474 (1960); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co., <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 87</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 834 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An employment contract is not a sufficient proprietary interest
   
   to require full-scale constitutional protection in the form of a pretermination hearing. Maines v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 116</cite>, 265 S.E.2d 204 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Enforcement of Insurance Contract.
   
   - Where a provision in an insurance policy is a valid one, the parties are entitled to have it enforced as written, and the Supreme Court cannot ignore any part of the contract. Muncie v. Travelers Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 74</cite>, 116 S.E.2d 474 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sovereign immunity is not a defense to an action against the State for breach of a contract
   
   entered into by the State's authorized officers and agencies, since to deny the party who has performed his obligation under a contract the right to sue the State when it defaults is to take his property without compensation and thus to deny him due process. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying the State's sovereign immunity defense in state employees' breach of contract action because a contract between the State Health Plan and an insurance company was made to confer longterm care benefits directly upon state employees as consideration for their employment; (1) sovereign immunity may be waived when the State enters into a valid contract; (2) when the State waives sovereign immunity, it occupies the same position as any other litigant; (3) when the State occupies the same position as any other litigant, it may be sued by a third party to enforce a contract made for the direct benefit of that third party; and (4) sovereign immunity does not bar third-party beneficiary contract claims against the State. Carl v. State, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 665 S.E.2d 787 (2008), review denied, cert. denied, review dismissed, as moot, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 123</cite>, 672 S.E.2d 683
   (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Obligation of Contract May Not Be Impaired.
   
   - This section prohibits enforcing any statute which would enable one person to evade or avoid the binding force of his contracts with another, whether executed or executory. Booth v. Hairston, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 278</cite>, 136 S.E. 879, 57 A.L.R. 1186 (1927), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 8</cite>, 141 S.E. 480 (1928), citing Lowe v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. 472</cite>, 17 S.E. 539, 22 L.R.A. 379 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        The obligation of a contract, within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition against impairment, includes all the means and assurances available for enforcement of the contract at the time of its execution. Bateman v. Sterrett, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 59</cite>, 159 S.E. 14 (1931).

   is a part of the liberty of which the citizen cannot be deprived without due process of law, but it can be restricted consistent with due process of law. State v. Dobbins, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 484</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 449 (1971).

        Quarantine of Disaster Areas.
   
   - The constitutional protection of the freedom of travel does not mean that areas ravaged by flood, fire or pestilence cannot be quarantined when it can be demonstrated that unlimited travel to the area would directly and materially interfere with the safety and welfare of the area. State v. Dobbins, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 484</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 449 (1971).

        Curfew Where Danger Is Clear and Present.
   
   - Where the danger is clear and present, the Constitutions of the United States and of North Carolina do not forbid city authorities to declare a state of emergency and to proclaim and enforce a temporary, night-to-night, city-wide curfew, with specified exceptions for emergency and necessary travel. State v. Dobbins, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 484</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 449 (1971).

        Public Office Is Not A Vested Property Right.
   
   - For case overruling line of cases which stood for the proposition that a public office was property in which the officeholder held a property interest, see Mial v. Ellington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. 131</cite>, 46 S.E. 961 (1903).

        Vested Rights in Dedicated Property.
   
   - Where lots in a subdivision were sold with reference to a plat showing the street in question to be 99 feet in width, while at the time the charter was granted to a municipality embracing the lands, the only plat recorded was a revised one showing the street as 80 feet wide, the granting of the charter could not be construed as having the effect of limiting the width of the street to 80 feet so as to defeat the vested right of purchasers of lots with reference to the original plat to compel the owner to abide by its dedication of the street for the full width as shown by the plat.

        Abandonment of Part of Road.
   
   - The action of the governing body of a town in abandoning and permitting part of a road in a subdivision to be closed for the private use and benefit of the defendant property owners in the subdivision was in violation of the rights of other purchasers in the subdivision under this section and under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Town of Blowing Rock v. Gregorie, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 364</cite>, 90 S.E.2d 898 (1956).

       <p>
        Vested Rights in Pre-1983 Estates by the Entirety.
   
   - The claim of a vested property right may not rest upon state enforcement of common law which is unconstitutionally discriminatory. Thus, to the extent that defendant husband's claims to the exclusive right to the control and income of pre-1983 estates by the entirety were based solely upon common-law incidents of the tenancy, they would fail, as the right recognized by the common law could not be said to be a "vested property right."

        Destruction or Diminishment of Contingent Property Interests.

        Sale of Lands Subject to Contingent Interest.
   
   - A contingent remainderman in lands acquires his interest therein subject to the payment of testator's debts, and in that respect can acquire no vested interest therein, and a sale thereof in good faith and at a fair price by the executrix, for the payment of decedent's debts, as authorized by statute, when by proper proceedings the land could have been sold for the purpose, though the executrix has mistaken therein the authority given her under the will, could not be held as contrary to the provision of this section.

        No Constitutional Right to Erosion Control.
   
   - Plaintiffs' claim that hardened structure rules promulgated by defendants effected a taking of property without just compensation and violated <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113A.html#t113Aa07s113A-128" target="_blank">G.S. 113A-128</a></cite> of the Coastal Area Management Act were properly dismissed, because plaintiffs failed to cite any persuasive authority for the proposition that a littoral or riparian landowner has a right to erect hardened structures in statutorily designated areas of environmental concern to protect their property from erosion or migration. Shell Island Homeowners Ass'n v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 217, 517 S.E.2d 406 (1999).

        Hardened structure rules,
   
   codified at 15A NCAC 7H.0308 and 7H.0301, which prevent permanent structures from being erected in environmentally sensitive areas which may adversely impact the value of the land and adjacent properties, as well as the right to public enjoyment of such areas, are clearly rationally related to legitimate government interests and, therefore, did not violate plaintiffs' equal protection rights.

         Revival of Barred Claims.

        - A State statute purporting to revive a claim barred by the statute of limitations violates the due process clauses of the State and federal Constitutions, whether such claim affects vested property right or arises under contract.

        When Statute Will Be Declared Invalid.
   
   - It is only when a classification or distinction in a statute is arbitrary and unjustifiable upon any reasonable view that it becomes invidious and offensive to the Constitution, so that the court may undertake to exercise the extraordinary power it possesses to declare the statute void. The unconstitutionality must clearly appear before the court can so declare it. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 164 S.E.2d 631 (1968), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969); Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests upon him who assails it,
   
   and courts may not declare a legislative discrimination invalid unless, viewed in the light of facts made known or generally assumed, it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that the classification rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable doubt must be resolved in favor of constitutionality
   
   of an act of the General Assembly, so that a statute will not be declared unconstitutional unless it is clearly so. Vinson v. Chappell, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 348, 164 S.E.2d 631 (1968), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 234</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 686 (1969).

        If a statute is susceptible of two interpretations, one constitutional and the other unconstitutional, the former will be adopted.

        Separate Classifications.
   
   - Under the state and federal equal protection clauses, a state statute or regulation which has the effect of creating separate classifications preferring one group over another must be rationally related to legitimate state interest(s).

        No Vested Right in Continuation of an Existing Law.
   
   - The fact that husband acquired property during marriage but prior to the effective date of the Equitable Distribution Act does not mean that he also acquired a vested right in the law governing the disposition of property upon divorce which was in effect either at the time the property was acquired or at the time of his marriage. There is no such thing as a vested right in the continuation of an existing law. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).

   20-88(a) wholly failed to afford aggrieved persons any notice of staff decisions, whereby such person could avail him or herself of such appeal rights, resulted in a fundamental denial of due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 19 of the North Carolina Constitution, they had not cited any authority in support of the proposition that they were entitled to constitutional protection against changes in the treatment of adjoining tracts of property under properly-adopted zoning or subdivision ordinances. They had asserted nothing more than a reliance on the continued existence of the existing legal situation coupled with a mere expectation that no change to which they objected would be made in the use of an abutting 16-acre tract of property. Coventry Woods Neighborhood Ass'n v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C.

        A municipal ordinance is presumed to be valid,
   
   and the burden is upon the complaining party to show its invalidity or inapplicability. Moreover, a municipal ordinance promulgated in the exercise of the police power will not be declared unconstitutional unless it is clearly so, and every intendment will be made to sustain it. Currituck County v. Willey, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 835, 266 S.E.2d 52, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 234</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 131 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The party assailing the constitutionality of an ordinance must carry the burden
   
   of showing that the ordinance does not rest upon any reasonable basis, but is essentially arbitrary; and if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain the ordinance, the existence of that state of facts at the time the ordinance was enacted must be assumed. Currituck County v. Willey, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 835, 266 S.E.2d 52, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 234</cite>, 283 S.E.2d 131 (1980).

V), and that defendant told the potential witness that his client would not testify against the witness if the witness would not testify against his client, the Commission's order of public censure was proper and did not violate defendant's right to due process and equal protection.

       </p>
       <p>
        While North Carolina's ballot access scheme inevitably burdened the associational rights of members of small parties as well as the informational interests of all voters regardless of their party affiliation, it also found that associational rights were not absolute and were necessarily subject to qualification if elections were to be run fairly and effectively. Because a legislative enactment had to be upheld unless its unconstitutionality clearly and unmistakably appeared beyond a reasonable doubt or it could not be upheld on any reasonable ground, the appellate court held that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a09s163-96ol1a2" target="_blank">G.S. 163-96(a)(2)</a></cite> was not violative of N.C.

   12, 14, and 19 because the requirements did not severely burden associational rights, as: (1) minority parties seeking recognition had over three and one-half years to obtain the required signatures; (2) statute put few restrictions on signatories, since signatories did not have to register with or promise to vote for candidates of the party seeking recognition, and could vote in a major party's primary; (3) handful of supporters could obtain the required signatures; and (4) requirements were readily achievable.

   12, 14, and 19 because the requirements: (1) were not subject to strict scrutiny; (2) imposed a reasonable hurdle to ballot access, as signatories were not disqualified for voting in another party's primary, the requirements were more permissive than requirements upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court; and (3) did not discriminate against minor parties or operate to freeze the political status quo of a two-party system.

        Zoning Ordinance Upheld.
   
   - Where only four residences in the vicinity of property owners' residence were built beyond the property line and where the town building inspector had indicated that in his 16 years on the job, a rear yard setback of seven and a half feet from the property line was required, there was no evidence to suggest "conscious and intentional discrimination" on the part of the town in enforcing its setback ordinance, such that an equal protection violation under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV or N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">

   19 was shown; accordingly, the town's zoning ordinance withstood constitutional attack. Prewitt v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 481, 595 S.E.2d 442 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Zoning amendment enacted to address over-occupancy of rental houses did not violate rental property owners' rights to substantive due process of law because the increased effectiveness of the enforcement mechanism of citing the owners rather than their tenants was rationally related to the goal of decreasing over-occupancy; the practice of more avidly enforcing the housing code against owners than against transient tenants was reasonably calculated to effectively secure compliance with the code.

        County Sign Ordinance.
   
   - Provision of county sign ordinance requiring nonconforming uses to be discontinued within three years from effective date of ordinance, thus giving the owner of a nonconforming sign a three-year period in which to amortize or depreciate the cost of the sign, is reasonable and does not provide for an unconstitutional taking of property. County of Cumberland v. Eastern Fed. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 269 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 527</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 453 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        A county sign ordinance does not violate the equal protection clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV or this section merely because the county will not enforce the ordinance with respect to any person owning or operating a sign in certain municipalities within the county, since counties may not exercise zoning authority within a city which has enacted a zoning ordinance and counties may defer from zoning within cities. County of Cumberland v. Eastern Fed. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 518, 269 S.E.2d 672, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 527</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 453 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the restrictions in the Sign Control Ordinance of Transylvania County, North Carolina, are rationally related to the legitimate state concern of protecting the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of the State of North Carolina, the ordinance does not violate the equal protection guarantee of N.C.

        Trail court did not err in assigning of an aggravated sentence to defendant because defendant's federal and state due process and equal protection rights were not violated where defendant committed an offense while on pretrial release on another charge, the State properly and timely notified defendant more than six weeks before trial of its intent to prove the existence of three aggravating factors against defendant and the statute at issue applied to all defendants against whom the State sought to prove the aggravating factor of having committed an offense while on pretrial release for another charge.

        Search and Seizure.
   
   - Where an officer observed defendant drive over a curb, back away from the officer, and reach into a pocket in a location known for drug activity, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officer had reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop and had probable cause to seize a film canister from defendant's pocket during a pat-down for weapons based on, inter alia, defendant's actions, the area's reputation, and the officer's prior experiences. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 658 S.E.2d 501 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress finding that his arrest was illegal and as such was a violation of his right to be free from unreasonable seizures, the State appealed, arguing successfully that the trial court erred in basing its decision on whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave during the interaction, rather than determining whether there existed special circumstances which would justify a law enforcement officer's actions, and whether those actions were the least intrusive means of carrying out the purpose of the stop. The trial court had to determine whether special circumstances existed that would have justified the officer's use of handcuffs such that they remained the least intrusive means reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the stop. State v. Carrouthers, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 683 S.E.2d 781 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of fact supported a conclusion of reasonable suspicion on the part of a police officer to stop and frisk defendant because, due to the high crime area in which the stop occurred, the officer's experience and knowledge of the area, and defendant's behavior when defendant saw the officer in defendant using defendant's right hand to grab defendant's waistband to clinch an item, the officer had a reasonable suspicion both to stop defendant and frisk defendant for weapons.

   19 claims against a state official failed because (1) the registrant sought no removal from Michigan's registry, and (2) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa27As14-208.7ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 14-208.7(a)</a></cite> and 14.208.6(4)(b) gave the official no discretion to remove him from North Carolina's registry.

       <p>
        When a trial court found an offender was no threat to public safety, it was not a substantive due process violation to deny the offender's petition for removal from the sex offender registry because the court also found terminating the offender's duty to register would not comply with federal standards, and incorporating those standards into <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa27As14-208.12" target="_blank">G.S. 14-208.12</a></cite>A(a1)(2) was rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest in protecting public safety.

   - Defendant waived the claim that defendant's right to due process was violated when the trial court failed to ensure that defendant had the mental capacity to understand the nature and object to the proceedings, to consult with counsel, and to assist in her defense, because defendant did not request a competency hearing or make a motion detailing the conduct resulting in a question as to defendant's capacity to proceed after defendant's was not given anti-anxiety medication on one day of trial.

        Obscenity.
   
   - Where, in an obscenity trial, the trial judge declined to judicially restrict or expand the term "community," permitting the jurors to apply the standards of the community from which they came in much the same manner as they would determine the propensities of a reasonable person in other areas of the law, neither <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa26s14-190.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-190.1</a></cite> nor the judge's instructions contravened the Constitution by failing to specify what is meant by "community."

        Eligibility to Receive Child Care Benefits.

        Short Form Murder Indictment Lacking Elements of Premeditation and Deliberation Upheld.
   
   - The court rejected the defendant's argument that because the indictment failed to allege two essential elements of first degree murder, i.e., premeditation and deliberation, his conviction of first degree murder based thereon violated Article I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19, 22 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that the defendant had adequate notice of the charge against him, as North Carolina has for nearly 100 years authorized the use of the short form murder indictment as sufficient to allege the elements of premeditation and deliberation, and the jury was properly required to find those elements beyond a reasonable doubt.

These sections provide a sufficient judicial standard, and are not unconstitutionally vague or arbitrary, and do not violate the equal protection clauses of the United States or North Carolina Constitutions.

        Claim Against North Carolina Department of Health And Human Services, Division of Child Development And Early Education.
   
   - Day care center had no direct constitutional claim against the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Division of Child Development and Early Education, because the day care center had an adequate state remedy before the North Carolina Industrial Commission, which could hear tort claims against state agencies, which the day care center pursued, as (1) the day care center could have been compensated for the day care center's constitutional claim, and (2) the day care center's non-compliance with the statute of limitations did not render that remedy inadequate.

       <p>
        Teachers.
   
   - It was not a denial of equal protection for the State to prescribe one procedure for the dismissal of a school teacher during the school year on the ground of immoral or disreputable conduct or failure to perform the teacher's contract, and to prescribe a different procedure for the termination of the employment at the end of the school year under former G.S. 115-142. The vast difference in the consequences of these two actions, insofar as the future effect upon the teacher's professional standing and ability to obtain employment was concerned, was ample basis for classification within the limits of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV and of this section. Still v. Lance, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 254</cite>, 182 S.E.2d 403 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A regulation of the State Board of Education which requires all teachers employed in the public school system of North Carolina to obtain a renewal of their teaching certificates every five years and prescribes for all teachers the same number of credits and the same methods for obtaining such credits does not deny equal protection of the law, notwithstanding the fact that the regulation does not apply to employees of the Board who are not engaged in teaching, whose duties are performed in the Board's offices. Since the purpose of requiring a certificate to teach is to assure good quality of performance in the classroom, there is an obvious and reasonable basis for making the rule applicable to those who teach and omitting from its applicability those who do not. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1972).

        - When a parent alleged the parent's autistic children were denied rights to a sound basic education due to a school board's (board) failure to remedy the children's harassment by other students, the board's motion to dismiss should have been granted because, while the board could not assert governmental immunity as a defense to an alleged constitutional violation, the constitutional right to a sound basic education had not been interpreted to extend beyond the intellectual function of academics.

        An ordinance enacted to regulate business providing male and female companionship was overbroad and not rationally related to a substantial government purpose and violated our State Constitution.

        Criminal Provisions.
   
   - The provisions of former G.S. 115-253 relating to approval by the State Board of Education of the instructional and sales methods and solicitors of nonresident business, trade or correspondence schools were clearly an unwarranted delegation of legislative power, and a conviction and punishment under the criminal provisions thereof violated "the law of the land" under this section.

       <p>
        Fair Trade.
   
   - The "nonsigner" provision of former G.S. 66-56 was unconstitutional, insofar as it purported to extend to one not a party thereto the effect of a fair trade contract, because it deprived the nonsigner of liberty, contrary to the law of the land, in violation of this section.

       <p>
        Fee Waiver Policy.
   
   - Fee waiver policy adopted by city board of education was unconstitutional where it failed to establish a mechanism by which the schools would affirmatively notify students and their parents of the availability of a waiver or reduction of the fee or by which the students or parents themselves might apply for a partial or complete exemption from the fee requirements, since the waiver policy did not fairly guarantee to low income and indigent students their right of equal access to the educational opportunities available at their schools and did not accord procedural due process to such students.

       <p>
        Insurance Provisions.
   
   - The State may not, consistent with the law of the land clause of this section or the due process clause of U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, require an insurance company to engage in the health care liability insurance business as a condition to its right to continue to carry on an entirely different business for which it is duly licensed by the State and in which it wants to be, and is, engaged.

        Military Property Sales Facilities.
   
   - If the State's primary purpose in Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.127B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 127B</a></cite> is to prevent the owners of military property sales businesses from illegally purchasing property which they believe may be stolen, that section cannot stand, as the State may not undertake by regulation to rid ordinary occupations and callings of the dishonest; likewise, if the State, by this regulatory statute, is seeking to enlist plaintiff's aid in enforcing already existing criminal laws, either by allowing the State to trace the property to its criminal source, or to deter its disposition, and, therefore, its theft, it is also unconstitutional, as those who buy and sell military surplus property may not be required to incur additional expense, or abandon that part of their business, to assist in enforcing criminal laws.

        Article 1 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.127B.html" target="_blank">Chapter 127B</a></cite>, concerning military property sales facilities, violates this section, as assuming arguendo that the State's police power extends to aiding the federal government in preventing theft from U.S. military bases, the statute is an unreasonable, and therefore unconstitutional, means of achieving that purpose.

        Receivership.
   
   - To permit an operating receiver to hazard the property rights of lienholders without their consent in a perilous private enterprise merely because the court may entertain the uncertain hope that some pecuniary advantage might thereby be obtained for the general creditors or some other third persons would transgress the basic concept enshrined in this section that no person may be deprived of his property except by his own consent or the law of the land.

        Street Improvements.
   
   - A municipal ordinance requiring a railway company to pay the entire expense of rebuilding an overpass trestle to accommodate the opening of a new street was, under the facts, an unreasonable exercise of the police power, amounting to an invasion of the company's property rights in violation of the constitutional guarantee provided by this section.

         C. SUNDAY CLOSING LAWS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally.
   
   - This section does not deprive the legislature of authority to prohibit by a statute, otherwise valid, the carrying on of and engaging in, on Sunday, any and all labor and the operation of industrial and commercial pursuits, except for works of necessity and acts which, themselves, are in exercise of the constitutional right to worship. Moreover, the legislature may delegate this power to municipalities. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the State nor the federal Constitution requires that a statute or ordinance, enacted for establishing Sunday as a day of rest, be held invalid unless it prohibits every activity which could be brought within its scope. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislative body has a wide discretion in determining which activities do and which do not interfere with the observance of Sunday as a day of general rest and relaxation sufficiently to justify the prohibition of those activities on that day, and the burden rests upon the person complaining to establish the absence of a reasonable basis for such determination. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the objective of a municipal ordinance is the establishment of Sunday as a day of general rest and relaxation, the difference in treatment by the ordinance of two types of business must be supported by a reasonable basis for the conclusion that one, substantially more than the other, will interfere with such use and enjoyment of the day. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general rule is that the enactment of Sunday regulations is a legitimate exercise of the police power, and that the classification on which a Sunday law is based is within the discretion of the legislative branch of the government or within the discretion of the governing body of a municipality clothed with power to enact and enforce ordinances for the observance of Sunday, and will be upheld, provided the classification is founded upon reasonable distinctions, affects all persons similarly situated or engaged in the same business without discrimination, and has some reasonable relation to the public peace, welfare and safety. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The validity of a Sunday closing statute or ordinance depends upon its reasonable relation to the accomplishment of the State's legitimate objective, which, in this instance, is the promotion of the public health, safety, morals, and welfare by the establishment of a day of rest and relaxation. Legislation for this purpose, like other legislation, may not discriminate arbitrarily either as between persons, or groups of persons, or as between activities which are prohibited and those which are permitted. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for a Sunday closing ordinance to withstand an attack upon its constitutionality, it is not necessary that the legislative body prohibited everything which is detrimental to the public morals, health or safety; it is sufficient that there is reasonable basis for belief that the operation on the day of rest of excepted businesses is necessary or conducive to the enjoyment by the public of the designated day as a day of rest, and that the activities of the defendant are not. State v. Atlas, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 165</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 496 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unconstitutional discrimination in a county ordinance requiring businesses generally to be closed on a specified day of the week, designated by the legislative body as a day of rest, but exempting from such requirement certain types of business, is not shown by the fact that the ordinance of some other county or municipality does not contain identical exemptions from its general closing requirement. State v. Atlas, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 165</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 496 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Illustrative Cases.
   
   - An ordinance prohibiting certain activities on Sunday held not in contravention of this section. State v. McGee, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 633</cite>, 75 S.E.2d 783, appeal dismissed, 346 U.S. 802, 74 S. Ct. 50, 98 L. Ed. 334 (1953), rehearing denied, 346 U.S. 918, 74 S. Ct. 272, 98 L. Ed. 413 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinance prohibiting generally the operation of all businesses within a municipality on Sunday, but excepting certain businesses, was held not to violate this section. Clark's Charlotte, Inc. v. Hunter, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 222</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 364 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinances prohibiting the exercise of all occupations generally on Sunday, "except those of necessity and charity," are constitutional, and exceptions are valid if they are reasonable and do not discriminate within a class between competitors similarly situated. Charles Stores Co. v. Tucker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. 710</cite>, 140 S.E.2d 370 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The classification of night clubs into those "located within 300 yards of the property on which is located any public school or church building" and all others, for the purpose of closing the former from 2:00 A.M. until 12:00 midnight on Sunday, was both unreasonable and discriminatory. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        A Sunday observance ordinance which classified "sporting goods and toys" as prohibited items and live bait as permitted items could not be considered unreasonable, arbitrary or discriminatory. S.S. Kresge Co. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 1</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 236 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A municipal ordinance which prohibited the sale on Sunday of mobile homes but which did not prohibit the sale of conventional homes would be held valid, since a classification based on the differences between the two types of selling (presence or absence of traffic, congestion, and noise) bore a reasonable relation to the purpose of the ordinance in establishing Sunday as a day of rest and relaxation. Raleigh Mobile Home Sales, Inc. v. Tomlinson, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 661</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 542 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        A Sunday closing ordinance which singled out and banned the operation of billiard halls on Sunday but permitted other businesses which provided facilities for recreation, sports and amusements, which were potentially equally disruptive, violated the equal protection clauses of the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. State v. Greenwood, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 651</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 8 (1972).

        Search and Seizure Requirements Under U.S. Const., Amend. IV Compared.
   
   - Though the language in this section, providing in substance that any search or seizure must be "supported by evidence," is markedly different from that in the federal Constitution, there is no variance between the search and seizure law of North Carolina and the requirements of U.S. Const., Amend. IV as interpreted by the Supreme Court of the United States. State v. Hendricks, <cite class="nc_code">43 N.C. App.</cite> 245, 258 S.E.2d 872 (1979), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 123</cite>, 262 S.E.2d 6 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pointing to the differences in language in the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and this section of the North Carolina Constitution, the North Carolina Constitution is more protective of a person's privacy and requires a stricter standard in justifying a warrantless search. State v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 724, 411 S.E.2d 193 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of this section differs markedly from the language of U.S. Const., Amend. IV. Nevertheless, this section prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. State v. Arrington, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 633</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 254 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require more particularity in subpoenas than does U.S. Const., Amend.
   
   IV as applied to the states through U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. In re Computer Technology Corp., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 337 S.E.2d 165 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Other State Remedies Must Be Exhausted.
   
   - A state constitutional action is not proper under this section, unless no other state remedy is available; here, an existing state tort remedy precluded plaintiff's assault-based constitutional claim against an arresting officer. Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 538 S.E.2d 601 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error to grant summary judgment in favor of a police officer and a city, as to a citizen's claims under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19, 20, 21, and 35, based on the officer's alleged use of excessive force, because the fact that the citizen had to overcome the affirmative defense of public officer immunity to succeed on the citizen's tort claims did not negate the claims' adequacy as a remedy, so a direct cause of action under the North Carolina Constitution was not permitted. Debaun v. Kuszaj, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 767 S.E.2d 353 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Standing to Object to Search.
   
   - Burglary defendant had no standing to object to the search of a car from which evidence was taken by the FBI where, although defendant had paid $3,500 of the $4,000 purchase price, the owner of the car dealership retained title and had given his consent to the search. State v. Mandina, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 373 S.E.2d 155 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not have standing to contend that the search and seizure of a briefcase and its contents violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20 of the North Carolina Constitution, where the defendant presented no evidence that he asserted any ownership or possessory interest in the briefcase. State v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. App.</cite> 265, 450 S.E.2d 503 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not seized under the Fourth Amendment when the officer activated the blue lights on his patrol car because he chose to continue driving and did not submit to the officer's authority. The seizure occurred approximately two minutes later when defendant stopped his vehicle. State v. Mangum, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 795 S.E.2d 106 (2016), review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 797 S.E.2d 8, 2017, N.C. LEXIS 168 (2017), review denied, appeal dismissed, stay denied, 797 S.E.2d 283, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 171 (2017).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Abandoned Property.
   
   - For abandonment to occur, the discarding of property must occur in a public place; one simply cannot abandon property within the curtilage of one's own home. State v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 109, 641 S.E.2d 320 (2007), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 701</cite>, 653 S.E.2d 155 (2007), State v. Reed, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 109, 641 S.E.2d 320 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Open Field.
   
   - Land consisting of nearly 119 acres of wooded land constituted an "open field," so that the investigating officers' entry onto the property and the observations that they made while they were there did not constitute a search for U.S. Const., Amend. I, purposes, where hunting was the only activity that took place upon the property, other than the growing of trees, and there were no buildings or residences contained on the tract of land. State v. Ballance, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 720 S.E.2d 856 (2012).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Expectation of Privacy in Property Relinquished to Another.
   
   - When one voluntarily puts property under the control of another, he must be viewed as having relinquished any prior legitimate expectation of privacy with regard to that property, as it becomes subject to public exposure upon the whim of the other person. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 765, 513 S.E.2d 568 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An ex parte order from the superior court, directing officials of a certain corporation to make available certain records
   
   pertaining to its transactions with two other corporations and with the City of Charlotte, incident to an investigation into possible fraud and irregularities in the purchasing of parts, equipment and services by the city, was not an administrative search warrant to which the strictness of U.S. Const., Amend. IV, this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a4As15-27.2" target="_blank">G.S. 15-27.2</a></cite> would apply; and where such order was neither unreasonably broad nor indefinite, its issuance would be affirmed. In re Computer Technology Corp., <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 337 S.E.2d 165 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Guilty as Well as Innocent Protected.
   
   - The fundamental law protects a person from the search of his private dwelling without a warrant, which protection extends to all equally, the guilty as well as the innocent. State v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 237</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 329 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The protection against illegal search extends to the justly, as well as to the unjustly, accused. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 559</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 177 (1965), overruled on other grounds, State v. Worsley, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 268</cite>, 443 S.E.2d 68 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        "Search" Defined.
   
   - A search ordinarily implies a quest by an officer of the law, a prying into hidden places for that which is concealed. State v. Raynor, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 219 S.E.2d 657 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact of Search Must Be Established.
   
   - Before the legality of an alleged search may be questioned, it is necessary to first determine whether there has actually been a search. State v. Raynor, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 219 S.E.2d 657 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable suspicion is the necessary standard
   
   for traffic stops, regardless of whether a traffic violation was readily observed or merely suspected, and to the extent language in State v. Ivey, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 562</cite>, 633 S.E.2d 459 (2006), may be interpreted as requiring probable cause, the North Carolina Supreme Court specifically disavows that interpretation. State v. Styles, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 412</cite>, 665 S.E.2d 438 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Protection Extends Only to Unreasonable Searches.
   
   - Constitutional protection does not extend to all searches and seizures, but only to those which are unreasonable. State v. Turnbull, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 192 S.E.2d 689 (1972); State v. Frederick, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 230 S.E.2d 421 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The guarantees of this section protect against unreasonable searches and seizures. They are designed for the protection of the innocent. State v. Ellington, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 198</cite>, 200 S.E.2d 177 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in requiring defendant to enroll in lifetime satellite-based monitoring following his future release from prison because defendant was not a "recidivist," would not be released from prison for 30 to 43 years, and the State failed to establish that lifetime satellite-based monitoring following defendant's eventual release from prison was a reasonable search where the State made no attempt to report the level of intrusion as to the information revealed under the satellite-based monitoring program, nor did it establish that the nature and extent of the monitoring that was currently administered, and upon which the present order was based, would remain unchanged by the time that defendant was released from prison. State v. Strudwick, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application to brief investigatory traffic stops
   
   the constitutional prohibition of unreasonable seizures of the person apply to brief investigatory traffic stops. State v. Schiffer, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 510 S.E.2d 165 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Traffic Stop Was Not Unconstitutional.
   
   - Trial court's finding that at the time defendant's vehicle changed lanes without a signal, it was being operated by defendant immediately in front of an arresting officer's vehicle indicated that defendant's failure to signal violated <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-154ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 20-154(a)</a></cite> because it was clear that changing lanes immediately in front of another vehicle might affect the operation of the trailing vehicle; the officer's observation of the traffic violation gave him the required reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle such that the stop was not unconstitutional. State v. Styles, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 412</cite>, 665 S.E.2d 438 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable Suspicion for Investigatory Stop.
   
   - As a general rule, a stop made for investigatory purposes is reasonable, and therefore constitutional, when the investigating officer has a reasonable suspicion, supported by articulable facts, that the person seized may have engaged in or may be engaged in criminal activity. State v. Schiffer, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 510 S.E.2d 165 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The level of suspicion required for an investigatory stop is lower than what is required for a seizure based on probable cause, which is a suspicion produced by such facts as indicate a fair probability that the person seized has engaged in or is engaged in criminal activity. State v. Schiffer, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 22, 510 S.E.2d 165 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not illegally seized in contravention of his constitutional rights, as an officer did not tell defendant he could not leave, defendant had consented to speak with the officer, and the officer had not restrained defendant's freedom to walk away. Defendant had no driver's license with him and did not know the name of a friend to whom his car belonged; these articulable facts were sufficient to give rise to a reasonable suspicion in the mind of a trained police officer that defendant was involved in criminal activity, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 644</cite>, 617 S.E.2d 1 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity justifying the stop of defendant's vehicle did not exist where a detective only observed defendant weaving within defendant's lane and the detective did not observe defendant violating any laws such as driving above or below the speed limit. Furthermore, defendant was stopped during the afternoon, not an unusual hour, and there was no evidence that defendant was near any places that sold alcohol. State v. Fields, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. App.</cite> 740, 673 S.E.2d 765 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer had reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle where an anonymous tip was received about an intoxicated person driving, and the officer's subsequent observations corroborated the tip. The officer testified that defendant consistently drove 15 miles below the speed limit, he stopped longer than usual at a corner and a railroad crossing, and he failed to pull over when the officer activated his lights, but continued driving for two minutes before finally stopping in the middle of the street. State v. Mangum, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 714, 795 S.E.2d 106 (2016), review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 797 S.E.2d 8, 2017, N.C. LEXIS 168 (2017), review denied, appeal dismissed, stay denied, 797 S.E.2d 283, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 171 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a criminal defendant files a motion to suppress challenging an investigatory stop, the trial court can deny that motion only if it concludes, after considering the totality of the circumstances known to the officer, that the officer possessed reasonable suspicion to justify the challenged seizure. State v. Nicholson, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 284</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 840 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable Suspicion for Continued Detention.
   
   - Detention after the identifications of the driver and defendant were returned was supported by reasonable suspicion and thus, did not violate the Fourth Amendment or N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20, where defendant and another gave conflicting statements about the origin of their travel, the driver did not know their purported destination, and their choice of route seemed incongruous with the travel route. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 714 S.E.2d 835 (2011), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">366 N.C. 110</cite>, 726 S.E.2d 161, 2012 N.C. LEXIS 410 (N.C. 2012).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable Cause to Arrest.
   
   - Inasmuch as the trial court's findings suggested the probability or substantial chance defendant engaged in criminal activity, the trial court did not err in concluding detectives had probable cause to arrest defendant. Thus, detectives did not unconstitutionally interview defendant, or seize his clothing and DNA, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motions to suppress. State v. Messer, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 812, 806 S.E.2d 315 (2017).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unreasonable Search Defined.
   
   - North Carolina has defined an unreasonable search as an examination or inspection without authority of law of one's premises or person with a view to the discovery of some evidence of guilt to be used in the prosecution of a criminal action. State v. Turnbull, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 192 S.E.2d 689 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Except in certain cases, a search of private property without proper consent is "unreasonable"
   
   unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant. State v. Frederick, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 230 S.E.2d 421 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The reasonableness of the search is in the first instance a substantive determination
   
   to be made by the trial court from the facts and circumstances of the case in the light of the criteria laid down by U.S. Const., Amend. IV and opinions which apply that amendment. State v. Turnbull, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 192 S.E.2d 689 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An unlawful search does not become lawful by the discoveries which result
   
   from it. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 559</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 177 (1965), overruled on other grounds, State v. Worsley, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 268</cite>, 443 S.E.2d 68 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence which is obtained as a result of an unreasonable search and seizure may not be admitted
   
   in either the State or federal courts. State v. Frederick, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 230 S.E.2d 421 (1976); State v. Small, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 646</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 429 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Confession After Confrontation with Articles Obtained by Illegal Search.
   
   - Where a confession is obtained from defendant after he has been confronted with stolen property recovered from his home in an unlawful search without a warrant, the court must find whether such confession was actually free and voluntary or whether it was triggered by the use of the articles obtained by the illegal search. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 559</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 177 (1965), overruled on other grounds, State v. Worsley, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 268</cite>, 443 S.E.2d 68 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Stop and Frisk Procedure.
   
   - Action of law enforcement agents who entered lounge pursuant to a valid search warrant and frisked defendant for weapons was not unconstitutional, since the North Carolina Supreme Court has upheld the "stop and frisk" procedure, and since there is a specific grant of authority in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa11s15A-255" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-255</a></cite>. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 380 S.E.2d 378 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well within the law to conduct a frisk of a defendant for weapons when strictly limited to a determination of whether defendant was armed. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. App.</cite> 691, 384 S.E.2d 50 (1989), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 588</cite>, 391 S.E.2d 187 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of Trial Court.
   
   - The trial court has a duty to pass upon the validity of a search and the competency of evidence procured thereunder when properly made the subject of inquiry. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 416, 190 S.E.2d 355, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 307</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 197 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge Issuing Search Warrant May Review Validity.
   
   - There is no statutory or constitutional proscription in North Carolina against a judge's presiding at a hearing to review the validity of a search warrant issued by that judge. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 413, 201 S.E.2d 527, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 87</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 21 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver.
   
   - By a voluntary waiver and consent to search, free from coercion, duress or fraud, and not given merely to avoid resistance, a defendant relinquishes the protection of U.S. Const., Amend. IV, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, and also relinquishes the protection given by this section against an unlawful search and seizure. State v. Little, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 234</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 61 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        If one voluntarily permits or expressly invites and agrees to a search, being cognizant of his rights, such conduct amounts to a waiver of his constitutional protection. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087, 89 S. Ct. 876, 21 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1969).

        When the evidence is delivered to a police officer upon request
   
   and without compulsion or coercion, there is no search within the constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. State v. Raynor, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 219 S.E.2d 657 (1975); State v. Small, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 646</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 429 (1977).

        Evidence in License Revocation Hearing Not Subject to Exclusionary Rule.
   
   - Whether or not law enforcement officers had reasonable and articulable suspicion to stop a driver, the evidence that resulted from the stop was not subject to the exclusionary rule; evidence in a license revocation hearing similarly is not subject to the exclusionary rule. Hartman v. Robertson, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 692, 703 S.E.2d 811 (2010).

        Defendant Was Not Seized.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting defendant's motion to suppress on the ground that law enforcement did not have reasonable suspicion to stop her vehicle because she was not seized when she stopped her van in the middle of a road; there was no evidence that defendant knew or reasonably believed the individuals in an unmarked pickup truck were law enforcement officers and no action on the part of law enforcement that caused her to stop her vehicle or otherwise impede her movement. State v. Turnage, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 719, 817 S.E.2d 1, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 786</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 438, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 1112 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress because there was no action on the part of a police officer that caused defendant's vehicle to stop moving, or otherwise impede defendant's movement where the officer was dispatched to check the status of a single car accident in a public vehicular area, and the mere activation of the officer's blue lights did not constitute a seizure.

        Violation Shown.
   
   - Where seizure was a violation of defendant's Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable searches and seizures, the evidence seized had to be suppressed. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">123 N.C. App.</cite> 114, 472 S.E.2d 169 (1996), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 633</cite>, 477 S.E.2d 45 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the civil domestic violence protective order at issue only required defendant to surrender any weapons that he might have, the officers executing the order lacked probable cause to suspect any particular criminal activity when they approached defendant's home, there were no exigent circumstances, and the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule did not apply to evidence obtained in violation of the state constitution. State v. Elder, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 753 S.E.2d 504, review denied, 758 S.E.2d 863, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 417 (2014).

        Defendant was seized because he was tailed by a marked police cruiser down empty streets at 3 a.m., followed into an empty parking lot, and then hailed down by the officer's hand gestures; a reasonable person would find such an empty, isolated location at such a late time of night to be intimidating, and would be more susceptible to police pressure which he otherwise might have felt free to ignore in a sunlit, crowded location; additionally, the officer was uniformed, presumably carrying a weapon, and was driving in his clearly-marked patrol vehicle.

        Motion to Suppress Properly Denied.
   
   - An anticipatory warrant to search the premises when an intercepted package containing contraband was delivered was properly executed where: (1) the warrant clearly established explicit triggering events on its face which were definable and preordained; (2) although the package was no longer in the house when the search occurred, the package was delivered, accepted, and taken into the house by defendant; (3) the delivery of the package linked the house to criminal activity inside, giving rise to probable cause for the search; and (4) the warrant specifically allowed the officers to search the premises to find and seize cocaine generally and to identify the participants of the crime; thus, a trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the anticipatory search warrant. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 588 S.E.2d 497 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence in the trial of his charge of assault on a law enforcement officer because, even if the police officers' entry into defendant's home was unlawful, the exclusionary rule did not operate to exclude evidence of defendant's assault on the law enforcement officers. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 616, 655 S.E.2d 860 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for possession with intent to manufacture, sell and deliver a Schedule II controlled substance, he contended that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of an unconstitutional search and seizure. An officer legitimately approached defendant's vehicle and detected the plain smell of marijuana as set forth in the Yates decision, and the plain smell of marijuana by the officer provided sufficient probable cause to support a search and defendant's subsequent arrest. State v. Corpening, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 683 S.E.2d 457 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant appealed his conviction and sentence for possession with intent to manufacture, sell and deliver a Schedule II controlled substance, he contended unsuccessfully that the trial court erred by denying his motion to suppress evidence. Defendant's argument that the checkpoint was unconstitutional was inapplicable since he stopped solely of his own volition, rather than pursuant to any form of State action; because he parked 100 to 200 feet prior to the checkpoint, the appellate court did not have to address (1) whether the checkpoint was valid, or (2) engage in an analysis concerning a traffic stop. State v. Corpening, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 311, 683 S.E.2d 457 (2009).

        No error was found in failing to suppress records of the location of defendant's cell phone because, inter alia, retrieval of the information was not a "search" requiring a warrant under the Fourth Amendment or N.C. Const., Art. I,

        No error was found in failing to suppress records of the location of defendant's cell phone because, inter alia, the good-faith exception to the warrant requirement applied, as an officer relied on procedures in the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C.S.

        Dog Sniff.
   
   - Trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress had to be vacated, as the judgment denying that motion was null and void because it was entered out of county, out of term, and out of session; as a result, the trial court had to hold a new suppression hearing, and at that time the court could consider whether defendant's constitutional rights were violated by a police officer's dog sniff of defendant's vehicle while defendant was detained at a checkpoint used to determine the validity of drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations, which led to the discovery that defendant possessed marijuana and cocaine.

        Search Exceeded Scope of Consent.

        Plain View Doctrine.
   
   - This section does not prohibit a seizure without a warrant where there is no need of a search, and where the contraband subject matter is fully disclosed and open to the eye and hand. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087, 89 S. Ct. 876, 21 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional and statutory guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure does not prohibit seizure of evidence and its introduction into evidence on a subsequent prosecution where no search is required. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971); State v. Raynor, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 538, 219 S.E.2d 657 (1975).

        No search warrant is needed to seize items in plain view.

       <p>
        Reasonable Suspicion to Stop Defendant's Vehicle.
   
   - Officer had reasonable suspicion for stopping defendant for violating <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-141ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 20-141(a)</a></cite>, by driving too quickly given the road conditions after the officer observed defendant abruptly accelerate his truck and turn left, causing the truck to fishtail in the snow before defendant regained control. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 32</cite>, 803 S.E.2d 137 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        When police officers discover evidence of a crime in plain view, without the necessity of a search, they may seize the evidence without obtaining a search warrant. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 204 S.E.2d 556, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 867 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        When contraband material is in plain view no search is necessary, and the constitutional guarantee against unreasonable search and seizure does not prevent either the seizure of the contraband without a warrant or its introduction into evidence. State v. Walker, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 157, 212 S.E.2d 528, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 264</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 436, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 894, 96 S.

        Trial court erred in suppressing the rifle, as it was in plain view after the officer learned that defendant was a felon in possession of a firearm. State v. Price, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 757 S.E.2d 309 (2014).

        Corporal had reasonable suspicion to conduct a traffic stop because he witnessed defendant run a red light. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 821 S.E.2d 656 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence obtained in a traffic stop was to be suppressed when a police officer arrived at a parking lot due to a vague tip about a white male engaged in suspicious activity and a gold or silver car in a parking lot in a generalized area known for residential break-ins and vandalism because the officer did not have the reasonable suspicion necessary to allow a lawful traffic stop of defendant when defendant drove a silver car from the parking lot, without acknowledging the approaching officer, and did not commit any traffic violations. State v. Horton, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. App.</cite> 711, 826 S.E.2d 770 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress because the police officer who stopped defendant's car lacked reasonable suspicion, as the officer did not see defendant or stumble or otherwise appear impaired leaving the convenience store with a beer in a brown bag and entering her car, there was no evidence that defendant drank from the beer, she did not violate any traffic laws prior to the stop, and according to the officer's own testimony defendant's driving appeared normal that evening. State v. Cabbagestalk, - N.C. App.
   - , 830 S.E.2d 5 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not plainly err in denying defendant's motion to suppress as its findings of fact, under the totality of the circumstances, supported the conclusion that the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe that defendant was using a cell phone in a manner proscribed by law. State v. Dalton, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 20, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        When Plain View Rule Applies.
   
   - The "plain view" rule does not apply unless the police have a right to be at the place where the evidence is discovered. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 204 S.E.2d 556, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 595</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 867 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of crime falling in the plain view of an officer who has a right to be in a position to have that view is subject to seizure and may be introduced into evidence. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 305</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 605 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1085, 101 S. Ct. 873, 66 L. Ed. 2d 810 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Lawfully on Premises.
   
   - When police officers lawfully enter a person's premises and observe evidence of a crime in plain view, they may seize it without obtaining a search warrant. State v. Carr, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 470, 204 S.E.2d 892 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        By being lawfully on the premises officers are entitled to seize such evidentiary objects connected with defendants as are in plain view. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 372</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 222, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        While Conducting Lawful Search.
   
   - While conducting a lawful search, where officers found in plain view property identified as that reported missing, these items were lawfully seized. State v. Travatello, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 211 S.E.2d 467 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Search of Automobiles and Conveyances.
   
   - Automobiles and other conveyances may be searched without a warrant under circumstances that would not justify the search of a house, and a police officer in the exercise of his duties may search an automobile or other conveyance without a search warrant when the existing facts and circumstances are sufficient to support a reasonable belief that the automobile or other conveyance carries contraband materials. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where police officers are exercising proper precautionary measures, it is not error to complete the search of defendant's automobile at a scene more tranquil than that at which the arrest was made. State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">17 N.C. App.</cite> 169, 193 S.E.2d 459 (1972), cert. denied, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 107</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 635, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 999, 94 S. Ct. 352, 38 L. Ed. 2d 235 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied the defendant's motion to suppress cocaine found in the trunk of a car defendant rented following a stop of the car for speeding because the trial court determined that a vehicle search by police officers was consensual; and the police officers had a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity because defendant and the driver of the car gave conflicting stories, the driver avoided direct eye contact with a police officer, and the back seat was full of personal belongings indicating that drugs might be in the trunk. These factors, coupled with the specific experience and training of the officers at the scene, gave rise to reasonable, articulable suspicion. State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 576 S.E.2d 695 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant's vehicle was properly subjected to an investigatory stop, and he was observed reaching under his front seat and then exited his vehicle and refused to comply with orders to get back in his car, police could conduct a protective search of the vehicle. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 130, 595 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 735</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 879 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized from his car after it was stopped for a traffic violation, as the search of the vehicle was based on defendant's unlimited consent, and further, information received from a passenger as to where contraband could be found in the vehicle justified the search under the automobile exception to the warrant requirement, pursuant to U.S. Const., Amend. IV and N.C. Const., Art. I,

   20. State v. Baublitz, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 801, 616 S.E.2d 615 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>

   <span class="s1">

   20 and U.S. Const., Amend.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's claim that an officer should have informed him that he was searching for narcotics so that defendant could have issued some limiting instructions before consenting to a vehicle search under the Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const., amend. IV, and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20 was rejected as: (1) there was no requirement that an officer inform defendant of what he was searching for; (2) the driver was asked if any weapons, cash or contraband were in the car; (3) defendant informed the officer that it might be difficult to search the vehicle as it was messy; (4) both the driver and defendant were aware that the search would be somewhat detailed as the driver was asked to identify any objects that did not belong to him; and (5) the officer immediately found a bag of marijuana under the front seat and marijuana seeds in the ashtray, and at that point, the officers had probable cause to search the entire vehicle and probable cause to arrest the driver and defendant.

        Officer had probable cause to stop defendant because the officer, who was traveling behind defendant, saw defendant change lanes without signaling, which was a violation <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-154ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 20-154(a)</a></cite>; the trial court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized after the stop was proper.

       </p>
       <p>
        Traffic stop violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights since the legal justification for a deputy's stop of defendant's vehicle was not objectively reasonable as the deputy stopped defendant for speeding under a mistaken belief as to the legal speed limit, and it was undisputed that defendant was not exceeding the speed limit; the U.S. and North Carolina Constitutions require an officer who makes a seizure on the basis of a perceived traffic violation to have probable cause to believe the driver's actions violated a motor vehicle law. State v. McLamb, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 124, 649 S.E.2d 902 (2007), review denied, stay denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 368</cite>, 663 S.E.2d 433 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officers had a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was involved in illegal activity when they stopped defendant's vehicle as: (1) an informant had told the police that defendant would be transporting cocaine that day and described the vehicle and indicated that the informant had seen cocaine in defendant's possession; (2) a car matching the informant's description arrived at the designated location at the approximate time specified; (3) the informant confirmed that the driver of the vehicle was defendant; and (4) the totality of the circumstances gave the officers a reasonable articulable suspicion that defendant was transporting drugs, which gave the officers probable cause to arrest and search defendant's car. State v. Crowell, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 362, 693 S.E.2d 370 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion to suppress evidence was properly denied, because the officer's observation of a speeding vehicle provided reasonable suspicion to justify an investigative stop and the conclusion that defendant was the person driving the vehicle was supported by the officer's description of the speeding vehicle and testimony that the officer only lost sight of the vehicle for a short time but immediately recognized the car and the driver when the officer saw the vehicle again after turning a corner the officer believed the car had taken. State v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 374, 737 S.E.2d 400 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence because a police officer possessed probable cause to search the vehicle; there were three pieces of evidence supporting the officer's probable cause to search defendant's vehicle, the scent of what the officer believed to be burnt marijuana emanating from the vehicle, the passenger's admission that he had just smoked marijuana, the partially smoked marijuana cigarette the passenger produced from his sock.

       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence because a police officer possessed probable cause to search defendant's vehicle; because the officer's observations and the passenger's that he had just smoked marijuana admission provided probable cause to search the vehicle, the officer was legally entitled to search every part of the vehicle for the presence of marijuana.

        Drug Search Upheld After Traffic Stop Under Wren Rule.
   
   - Where defendant, who had been stopped for speeding and following too closely, presented a nervous appearance, gave vague answers as to ownership of car, and refused permission to search it, court properly found police had probable cause, questioning did not exceed permissible scope of the traffic stop, and detention of defendant was justified and not in violation of defendant's constitutional rights under this section. The Supreme Court further declared subjective motives of police officer immaterial and upheld use of the objective. When rule standard to determine reasonableness of police action, related to probable cause, in view of constitutional concerns. State v.

       <p>
        Drug Dog Sniff.
   
   - Where a drug dog sniff was conducted on defendant's vehicle during a traffic stop, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because (1) the officers needed no further justification in order to conduct the dog sniff since the initial traffic stop was lawful, and (2) the dog sniff did not unreasonably prolong the detention. State v. Brimmer, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 653 S.E.2d 196 (2007).

       <p>
        Instinctive action by a police dog, unguided and undirected by the police, in nuzzling the opening of a garbage bag found in a closet of defendant's residence to reveal marijuana inside the bag, which brought evidence not otherwise in plain view into plain view, was not a search within the meaning of constitutional law.

       <p>
        Search of Recent Passenger Based on Drug Dog Alert Improper.
   
   - Trial court's grant of defendant's motion to suppress was proper, because the drug dog's positive alert at the front side driver's door of a motor vehicle did not give rise to probable cause to conduct a warrantless search of the person of a recent passenger. Without probable cause more particularized to defendant, the search of defendant, a passenger, violated the Fourth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,

        Sobriety Checkpoint.
   
   - Order suppressing evidence obtained by roadway checkpoint was error because no evidence suggested that the stated proper purpose of checkpoint (sobriety) was a mask for another, unconstitutional purpose, and as such the trial court was in error in holding that the lack of such evidence required it to exclude the evidence obtained by the stop; from the available evidence, it was clear that the actual purpose of the checkpoint was the same as its stated purpose: to check for sobriety.

        Attempt to Evade Checkpoint.
   
   - Traffic stop was constitutional, regardless of the constitutionality of a license checkpoint, because the place and manner of defendant's turn in conjunction with the proximity to the checkpoint, caused the officer to suspect that defendant was violating the law, and gave the officer reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle.

        Traffic Stop for Violation of Windshield Tinting Restrictions.
   
   - A deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop a car for violating windshield tinting restrictions, even though the tinting did not violate Florida law where the car was registered and despite the fact that the deputy misunderstood the applicable statutes, since the section did not except vehicles registered in other states, and the tinting did violate <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-127" target="_blank">G.S. 20-127</a></cite>.

        Informant's tip was sufficiently reliable to justify an investigative stop
   
   of the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger, as well as a brief investigative detention of the vehicle's occupants, to search for weapons. State v. Sanchez, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 556 S.E.2d 602 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 220</cite>, 560 S.E.2d 358 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Informant's tip had sufficient reliability and specificity to constitute reasonable suspicion to stop defendant as: (1) the chief of police had known the informant for 13 years, including as a child, and knew that the informant had provided previous information about illegal drug activity that had yielded an arrest; (2) the tip did not have to be analyzed as an anonymous tip; (3) the basis for the informant's knowledge did not have to be proven under the totality of circumstances test; and (4) the informant's tip provided specific information about defendant's future actions, including correctly predicting defendant's mode of transportation, defendant's destination, and defendant's time of arrival, which, after it was corroborated by the police, sufficiently demonstrated that the informant had inside knowledge about the suspect, giving the police reasonable suspicion to believe the rest of the informant's tip.

        Improper Vehicle Stop.
   
   - Order granting defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained following a stop of his vehicle was proper because the movements of defendant's vehicle observed by the officer were nothing more than weaving, and the stop was illegal; the officer saw no other signs of a high or low speed, no prolonged weaving, no improper turns, no inappropriate use of signals, and no other evidence of any type of improper or erratic driving. State v. Kochuk, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. App.</cite> 301, 741 S.E.2d 327 (2012), rev'd, 742 S.E.2d 801, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 499 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Length of Investigative Stop.
   
   - While the officer's initial use of handcuffs was reasonable because both defendant and his companion were acting aggressively and the officer was the only officer present, the length of defendant's detention might have turned the investigatory stop into a de facto arrest, necessitating probable cause, however the trial judge failed to make findings on whether the extended detention was justified while the officer pursued his investigation or whether he unnecessarily delayed defendant's detention.

        Suspicion of Impairment Held Reasonable.
   
   - Despite lack of an observed and verifiable traffic code violation by suspect, his driving 20 miles per hour below the speed limit and weaving within his lane were actions sufficient to raise a suspicion of an impaired driver in a reasonable and experienced trooper's mind. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 386 S.E.2d 217 (1989), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 366</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 809 (1990).

       <p>
        Defendant's contention that the trial court should not have denied defendant's motion to suppress because the officer who stopped defendant's two-wheeled motorized vehicle did not have probable cause to make the stop had to be rejected; the officer was only required to have reasonable suspicion to stop defendant's vehicle because the officer did not stop defendant's vehicle based on the traffic violation of operating an unregistered vehicle, which would have required probable cause, but, instead, stopped the vehicle after observing defendant operate the vehicle in a manner that allowed the officer to reach the reasonable conclusion that defendant was driving the vehicle while defendant was impaired. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 651 S.E.2d 589 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 341</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 733 (2008).

        Blood Test on Unconscious Defendant.
   
   - In a prosecution for involuntary manslaughter and driving under the influence, the performance of a blood alcohol test on blood seized from an unconscious defendant pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a02s20-16.2ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 20-16.2(b)</a></cite> did not violate defendant's rights under the U.S. Constitution and this section, because of (1) the existence of probable cause to arrest; (2) the limited nature of the intrusion upon the person; and (3) the destructibility of the evidence. State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 334 S.E.2d 463 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly granted defendant's motion to suppress blood draw evidence a police officer collected from a nurse who was treating defendant because the officer did not advise defendant of his rights and did not obtain his written or oral consent to the blood test; the State's post hoc actions did not overcome the presumption that the warrantless search was unreasonable, and it offended the Fourth Amendment and the State Constitution. State v. Romano, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 785 S.E.2d 168 (2016), modified and aff'd, 800 S.E.2d 644, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 398 (N.C. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly granted defendant's motion to suppress blood draw evidence a police officer collected from a nurse because the record did not affirmatively show that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe defendant, who was unconscious during the blood draw, committed the implied consent offense of driving while intoxicated; the record did not affirmatively show that defendant was intoxicated while he drove, but it raised a question as to whether defendant became very intoxicated. State v. Romano, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. App.</cite> 212, 785 S.E.2d 168 (2016), modified and aff'd, 800 S.E.2d 644, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 398 (N.C. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the United States Supreme Court's Fourth Amendment precedent regarding consent, the blood draw from defendant could not be justified under subsection (b) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a02s20-16.2" target="_blank">G.S. 20-16.2</a></cite> as a per se categorical exception to the warrant requirement; the implied-consent statute, as well as a person's decision to drive on public roads, are factors to consider when analyzing whether a suspect has consented to a blood draw, but the statute alone does not create a per se exception to the warrant requirement. State v. Romano, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 678</cite>, 800 S.E.2d 644 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court correctly suppressed defendant's blood sample because subsection (b) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a02s20-16.2" target="_blank">G.S. 20-16.2</a></cite> was unconstitutional as applied to defendant since it permitted a warrantless search that violated the Fourth Amendment; blood draws could only be performed after obtaining a warrant, valid consent from the defendant, or under exigent circumstances with probable cause, but the officer who took possession of defendant's blood did not get a warrant, and there were no exigent circumstances. State v. Romano, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 678</cite>, 800 S.E.2d 644 (2017).

        Drug and Alcohol Testing.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting a county board of education summary judgment in an action filed by a teacher, the North Carolina Association of Educators, support personnel, and administrators, seeking a declaration that the board's new drug and alcohol testing policy violated N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20 because the board's policy violated the guarantee against unreasonable searches, and board employees' acknowledged privacy interests outweighed the board's interest in conducting random, suspicionless testing; the policy did not specify the "bodily specimen" employees were required to produce, the employees did not have a reduced expectation of privacy by virtue of their employment in a public school system, and the record was devoid of any evidence that the board's prior policy was in any way insufficient to satisfy its needs. Jones v. Graham County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 677 S.E.2d 171 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant entered a conditional guilty plea to habitual impaired driving and appealed the trial court's denial of his motion to suppress a blood test, the warrantless blood draw did not violate Article I of the North Carolina Constitution. State v. Fletcher, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 688 S.E.2d 94 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error to deny defendant's motion to suppress the results of a nonconsensual, warrantless, blood draw because, when defendant refused an intoxilyzer test, exigent circumstances allowed the draw, considering the totality of the circumstances, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-139.1" target="_blank">G.S. 20-139.1(d1)</a></cite>, as an officer knew any alcohol in defendant's blood would dissipate and it would take four to five hours for a blood draw if a warrant were first obtained. State v. Dahlquist, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 750 S.E.2d 580 (2013), dismissed and review denied 755 S.E.2d 614, 2014 N.C. LEXIS 203 (2014).

       <p>
        Reasonable Suspicion for Weapons Search.
   
   - Officer had reasonable suspicion to briefly search defendant for weapons during a traffic stop and the denial of defendant's motion to suppress was proper because the officer used his prior experience and training to infer that the contents of defendant's right hand may have been a weapon and this inference went beyond unparticularized suspicion or hunch; because officers were allowed to take necessary steps to ensure their safety, the officer acted reasonably when he asked to see what was in defendant's hand. Moreover, the officer was led to a reasonable suspicion because of defendant's (1) erratic answers, (2) evasive actions, (3) continued refusal to show the officer the contents of his right fist, and (4) choice to raise his fist in a manner which led the officer to believe that defendant was about to strike him. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. App.</cite> 196, 678 S.E.2d 802 (2009).

       <p>
        Limitations on Pat-Down Search.
   
   - Although a police officer was justified in conducting a limited pat-down of the defendant to determine whether the defendant was armed, once the officer concluded that there was no weapon, he could not continue to search or question the defendant in order to ascertain whether a rolled up plastic bag was contraband. State v. Beveridge, <cite class="nc_code">112 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 436 S.E.2d 912 (1993), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 560</cite>, 441 S.E.2d 105, aff'd per curiam, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 601</cite>, 444 S.E.2d 223 (1994).

        Validity of Search Where Driver Not Charged with Offense.
   
   - Fact that driver was not charged thereafter with a DUI offense was not relevant to the trooper's initial suspicions; therefore, stop and search of car was valid. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">96 N.C. App.</cite> 389, 386 S.E.2d 217 (1989), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 366</cite>, 389 S.E.2d 809 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Results Not Suppressed Though State Line Crossed.
   
   - Neither the federal nor State Constitutions required that evidence of patrolman's detection of alcohol on defendant's breath and the results of a breathalyzer test given him by a Surry County deputy sheriff be suppressed where the arresting officer did not know that defendant crossed the state line into Virginia before stopping his truck. State v. Gwyn, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 406 S.E.2d 145, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 199</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 498 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Legitimate Expectation of Privacy in Communal Dumpster.
   
   - Because communal dumpster was not within the curtilage of defendant, he retained no legitimate expectation of privacy in his garbage once he placed it in said dumpster, and the warrantless search of the dumpster, resulting in charges of trafficking in cocaine, did not violate this section. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 518 S.E.2d 14 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Legitimate Expectation of Privacy in Conversation with Confederate.
   
   - Pre-arrest warrantless recording of defendant's incriminating statements through witness did not violate defendant's right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure under this section, inasmuch as defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy regarding a conversation he voluntarily maintained with a confederate, did not violate defendant's right under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23, to be free from compulsory self-incrimination because his participation in the conversation was wholly voluntary, albeit ill-advised, and did not violate defendant's right under N.C. Const., Art. I,

       <p>
        Defendant did not have reasonable expectation of privacy within his jail cell

       </p>
       <p>
        Warrantless Strip Search Proper.
   
   - Because a reasonable person would have understood from the circumstances and exchanges between the officers and defendant that police intended to conduct a strip search of defendant's person, and she consented to the strip search without withdrawing that consent at any time, the trial court properly denied her motion to suppress the evidence seized. State v. Neal, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 660 S.E.2d 586 (2008).
       </p>

   20 privacy interests; although the strip searches were intrusive, they were conducted in a discreet manner and in a discreet location, away from the roadside, and were limited in scope to finding drugs on defendant's person.

        Search Incident to Lawful Arrest.
   
   - Defendant's motion to suppress evidence of statements he made to deputies was properly denied because an informant's detailed information regarding a shooting was sufficiently corroborated by reliable and credible evidence, which established probable cause to arrest defendant. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 253, 681 S.E.2d 460 (2009).

        Cigarette Butts.
   
   - Defendant's cigarette butt was admissible because defendant abandoned the item in defendant's home's curtilage by giving the item to an officer who offered to dispose of the item, after defendant had been arrested, making the officers' subjective intent in executing a valid arrest warrant, when the cigarette butt was seized, including any deception, irrelevant. State v. Borders, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 149, 762 S.E.2d 490 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer's seizure of defendant's discarded cigarette butt from the parking lot near his apartment without a warrant did not violate his constitutional rights because the parking lot was not located in the curtilage of defendant's building, as it was not enclosed, it was used for parking by both the building's residents and the general public, and it was only protected in a limited way. State v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 767 S.E.2d 139 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the parking lot, by dropping the cigarette butt in the lot he was deemed to have abandoned any interest in it. Because defendant voluntarily abandoned the cigarette butt in a public place, the extraction of his DNA from it did not constitute a search. State v. Williford, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 123, 767 S.E.2d 139 (2015).

        Warrantless Search Upheld.
   
   - When officers saw liquid in containers generally used to contain and transport non-taxpaid liquor, under the circumstances then existing they had sufficient reasonable cause to believe that the jars contained non-taxpaid liquor to justify the seizure of the contraband without a search warrant. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 468</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 97 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of North Carolina held that both the trial court and the Court of Appeals erred in suppressing evidence seized during a warrantless search of defendant's automobile some 20 hours after an officer, who knew defendant and was familiar with her vehicle, received information that the automobile contained several one-fourth ounce packages of marijuana; the search was not illegal, and the evidence seized should not have been suppressed. State v. Isleib, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 634</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 573 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence of alleged contraband that was seized from defendant, as the police officer's observance very early one morning of defendant's vehicle parked on the shoulder of a road near a mobile home park into which another man had just fled gave the officer reasonable suspicion and justified the investigatory stop and detention of defendant; in addition, defendant's actions in "digging" through his glove compartment and searching around the interior of the vehicle made the officer's subsequent pat-down search of defendant permissible, at which time the officer discovered the alleged contraband defendant was carrying. State v. Martinez, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 105, 580 S.E.2d 54, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 466</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 773 (2003).

       <p>
        It was not unreasonable for authorities to strip defendant and comb through his pubic without search warrant after arresting him for first degree sexual assault, kidnapping and sodomy. Arrest was supported by probable cause and evidence could easily have been concealed or destroyed. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 397 S.E.2d 647 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the search involved a motor vehicle in a public area, the only determination left for review was whether deputy had probable cause to search the van; the trial court found as facts that deputy was sufficiently experienced to make a reliable determination that what he smelled was illegal contraband (white liquor), defendant appeared to deputy to be very nervous, and
   defendant had placed cardboard over a burned-out window on the van after a tire had caught fire; therefore deputy had reasonable grounds to conclude that the van contained contraband, and that he did not need a warrant to search. State v. Corpening, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 427 S.E.2d 892 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was reasonable suspicion to justify officer's search of defendant based on a telephone tip and the officer's observations of defendant. In re Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 290, 468 S.E.2d 610 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the incriminating evidence seized was immediately apparent to the officer, the cocaine was properly seized and admitted into evidence. In re Whitley, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 290, 468 S.E.2d 610 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied where the detectives' prior knowledge of local drug activity, coupled with their 1:00 a.m. observations at the address as well as the circumstances surrounding defendant's actions, provided a sufficient basis for those experienced law enforcement officers to draw a reasonable inference "that criminal activity was afoot," id., thus warranting the investigative stop. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 530 S.E.2d 297 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's arrest was lawfully based on the fruits of a valid pat down search, the warrantless search of his person incident to the arrest, which yielded marijuana and crack cocaine, was likewise constitutional; the initial check point stop and the driver's consent to the search of his vehicle provided sufficient constitutional justification for defendant's removal from the car, and the following facts supported the constitutionality of the pat down search: The long, narrow bulge in defendant's front pants pocket, his belligerent attitude toward the detectives, his apparent intoxication, and the driver's claim that he did not know defendant's name. State v. Pulliam, <cite class="nc_code">139 N.C. App.</cite> 437, 533 S.E.2d 280 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly concluded that a warrantless search conducted after a police officer and a detective entered a hotel room was not illegal where the detective had received information that the occupants of the room possessed drugs, the detective detected and observed behavior by the room's occupants indicative of drug-related criminal activity, and scales similar to those often used by dealers to measure quantities of illegal narcotics were in plain view. State v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 595, 582 S.E.2d 62, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 509</cite>, 588 S.E.2d 372 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress drugs obtained during a warrantless search of his car, as the drugs were found during a search incident to a lawful arrest supported by probable cause after verification of an informant's tip as to the vehicle, the perpetrator, and the location and approximate time of the alleged drug activity. State v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 310, 585 S.E.2d 481 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 135</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 518 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence obtained in a warrantless search of defendant's vehicle was admissible where the officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion to believe that defendant was committing an implied consent offense based on the facts that defendant's car was weaving combined with the unusual hour and the location, in an area near bars, and the search of defendant's car was lawful based on the fact that it was admittedly consensual and not tainted by an unlawful detention. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 251, 590 S.E.2d 437 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was suspected of committing two sexual assaults and a third was reported in the area from which defendant was observed traveling at about 4:00 a.m., when it was snowing and no other vehicles were on the road, police had reasonable suspicion of criminal activity allowing them to conduct an investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle, and defendant's expired license plate independently allowed the stop. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 130, 595 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 735</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 879 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion to suppress tangible evidence obtained when an officer chased him into a premises was properly denied because defendant's earlier presence in and accessibility to the premises was insufficient to establish the requisite privacy interest for the Fourth Amendment. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 777, 600 S.E.2d 31 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Investigatory stop supported by evidence that defendant and another were observed loitering at a closed shopping center shortly before midnight wearing dark clothing in an area targeted by law enforcement officers as a high crime area, that no other vehicles were in the shopping center parking lot, and that when a vehicle defendant recognized as a law enforcement vehicle appeared, the men abruptly and hurriedly returned to their vehicle, together with the other detailed findings of fact articulated by the trial court, which adequately supported the officers' reasonable belief that defendant and the other man were involved in criminal activity. State v. Blackstock, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 50, 598 S.E.2d 412 (2004), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 283</cite>, 610 S.E.2d 208 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction for second-degree murder was upheld on appeal, because defendant failed to show any prejudice with regard to the trial court's admission of a gun residue test over defendant's objection, because defendant did not object to the admission of any statements made during the test, only the test results itself, and the trial court's finding that exigent circumstances existed was supported by the evidence in that the test had to have been administered within a few hours of the shooting and defendant admitted he was one of the last to have seen the victim alive. State v. Page, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 609 S.E.2d 432 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Police had reasonable suspicion that defendant was transporting drugs, and their warrantless stop of defendant's van was proper, where a confidential informant told police that defendant would be transporting drugs and defendant was seen by police driving the van described by the informant along the suspected drug route; after the stop, defendant's consent for an officer to enter the van and the odor of cocaine smelled by the officer inside the van justified the officers' warrantless search of the van. State v. Downing, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 790, 613 S.E.2d 35 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that defendant was extremely nervous and refused to make eye contact, that an air freshener smell came from the vehicle, that the vehicle was not registered to the occupants, and that there was a disagreement between defendant and the passenger about the trip, provided law enforcement with the reasonable suspicion necessary to conduct the exterior canine sniff. State v. Euceda-Valle, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 268, 641 S.E.2d 858, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 698</cite>, 652 S.E.2d 923 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an officer observed defendant drive over a curb, back away from the officer, and reach into a pocket in a location known for drug activity, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officer had reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop and had probable cause to seize a film canister from defendant's pocket during a pat-down for weapons based on, inter alia, defendant's actions, the area's reputation, and the officer's prior experiences. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 658 S.E.2d 501 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury, attempted first degree murder, and armed robbery were affirmed because the trial court did not err by denying defendant's suppression motion; since neither the driver nor any of the passengers had a driver's license or other form of identification in their possession, the trooper could not quickly resolve the issues arising from the initial traffic stop. State v. Hernandez, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. App.</cite> 591, 704 S.E.2d 55 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stop of defendant's vehicle was reasonable despite the investigator's good faith mistake as to the identity of the driver because although the investigators did not personally observe defendant selling narcotics, the specific and articulable facts, as well as the rational inferences from those facts, as viewed through the eyes of a reasonable, cautious officer, guided by his experience and training were sufficient to create a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot to justify a brief investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 255, 703 S.E.2d 905, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 188</cite>, 707 S.E.2d 237, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 231 (2011).

   20 in making a warrantless entry into a home where defendant was found with marijuana plants because the officer was looking for a parent of a small child found naked and alone at the side of a nearby road, no one responded to knocking on the front door, and the rear door was ajar. State v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 696 S.E.2d 554 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrantless search did not violate defendant's rights, because the officer had probable cause to believe that evidence of criminal activity was located on defendant's person when he felt something hard between defendant's buttocks outside of defendant's clothing, and the officer had observed various drug-related items in the vehicle in which defendant was riding and defendant made furtive movements toward his pants. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 267, 727 S.E.2d 712 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Strip search was reasonable because the troopers search the car and defendant's outer clothing without finding the source of the marijuana odor, which was still strong, and the officers took reasonable steps to protect defendant's privacy. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 440, 737 S.E.2d 442 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress as the officers warrantless entry into defendant's residence and arrest of defendant was proper because the officers had reasonable suspicion to initiate an investigatory stop of defendant for driving while his license was revoked in front of defendant's residence; and the officers properly pursued defendant into his residence to arrest him for resisting a public officer when he did not obey their orders to stop as the officers had probable cause to arrest defendant for resisting a public officer and began a hot pursuit of defendant, which was one of the exigent circumstances delineated by the courts. State v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 664, 794 S.E.2d 357 (2016), review denied, 797 S.E.2d 15, 2017 N.C.

       <p>
        In a case in which defendant was convicted of possession of drug paraphernalia and carrying a concealed weapon, the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized at the time of his arrest. The appellate court concluded that the undisputed facts and circumstances known to the police officer supported the conclusion that the officer had the requisite reasonable suspicion to justify a traffic stop of defendant's car, and that the trial court's findings of fact supported this conclusion as well. State v. Evans, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 610, 795 S.E.2d 444 (2017).

        Officer had reasonable suspicion to search defendant's vehicle based on evidence that late at night, the stop occurred in a high-crime area, defendant exhibited a hand gesture, defendant appeared highly nervous, defendant "bladed" his body to shield something from being seen, and defendant had a violent criminal history involving weapons.

        Warrantless Search Held Improper.
   
   - Following defendant's guilty plea to felony possession of cocaine and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia under a plea agreement in which defendant preserved his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIXa53s15A-979ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-979(b)</a></cite>, the appellate court affirmed the denial of the suppression motion; pursuant to N.C.

        Due to the paucity of the evidence presented by the State, the appellate court agreed with the defendant that crack cocaine and drug paraphernalia seized by a police officer at the hospital while he was visiting and interviewing the wounded defendant should have been suppressed, because the warrantless seizure and search of wads of brown paper uncovered as nurse undressed defendant was unconstitutional. State v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 519 S.E.2d 770 (1999).

        Although an officer's stop of a vehicle in which defendant was a passenger was supported by reasonable suspicion based on the officer's observation of the vehicle speeding, the officer's search of defendant's person exceeded the scope of defendant's consent; after defendant gave the officer consent to search his person, the officer pulled defendant's sweat pants away from defendant's body and trained his flashlight on defendant's groin area, where he saw the top of a pill bottle.

        Officer lacked reasonable articulable suspicion of criminal activity to support the stop and frisk of defendant under Terry; the report that the officer received only indicated that a black male had committed armed robbery, a description that fit a substantial percentage of the population, and there was no further description as to age, physical characteristics, or clothing.

        Officer unreasonably detained the defendant after completing a traffic stop of the defendant's cousin, the driver of the car defendant was riding in, because the cousin's nervousness, in the context of the circumstances, did not rise to the level of reasonable suspicion necessary to justify further detention; among other things, the officer did not detect alcohol and found no contraband or weapons, and the fact that the rental car the defendant had rented was one day overdue did not raise the officer's suspicions. State v. Myles, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 42, 654 S.E.2d 752, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 344</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 732 (2008).

       <p>
        Defendant was entitled to the suppression of evidence obtained from an investigatory stop and subsequent searches of defendant's jacket and car because the police officer who stopped defendant could supply no facts to support a reasonable suspicion that a crime was afoot when he stopped defendant; moreover, defendant's resistance and flight and flight from the officer was not be used as retroactive justification for the stop. State v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 313, 655 S.E.2d 726 (2008).

        Trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to suppress the drug and weapon contraband found in his hotel room as his Fourth Amendment rights were violated as a result of the police accompanying a hotel manager into his room and discovering the contraband when no exigent circumstances existed nor did defendant consent to the entry by the police.

        Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence a deputy obtained during a traffic stop of his vehicle because the deputy's stop of the vehicle based only on his "unparticularized suspicion or hunch" did not meet the minimal level of objective justification necessary for the traffic stop, and the deputy did not articulate, and the trial court did not find, any specific facts about the vehicle itself which would justify the stop; trial court's general findings that defendant's presence at that time of night in a partially developed subdivision during a time where numerous copper thefts had been reported in the county did not support the trial court's conclusion of law that the deputy had reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity was afoot.

        Trial court erred in denying defendant juvenile's motion to suppress because the seizure of marijuana from defendant's person was illegal; when the officers began questioning defendant she was seized, and when the officer ordered defendant to empty her pockets he conducted a search for which probable cause was lacking and was not incident to arrest or custody.

        Although the officers had probable cause to search the vehicle when they detected the odor of marijuana on the driver's side of the vehicle, probable cause to search the vehicle did not amount to probable cause to search defendant, a passenger in the vehicle.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was insufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that the search of defendant's person was supported by probable cause particularized with respect to defendant as the officers detected the odor of marijuana on the driver's side of the vehicle and discovered marijuana in the driver's side door, but an officer testified that he did not notice an odor of marijuana on the passenger side of the vehicle or on defendant; and there was nothing linking the marijuana to defendant besides his presence in the vehicle.

        Voluntary Consent.
   
   - Where defendant gave trooper permission to search the entire contents of defendant's suitcase and did not retract or limit the consent, the trooper had defendant's consent to open package of cocaine contained therein, and the trial court did not err in allowing the contents of the package into evidence at trial.

        Girlfriend's consent to search defendant's residence was voluntary where there was no evidence that defendant's girlfriend, who was in the hospital with shoulder pain at the time she gave consent, was not in possession of her mental faculties at the time consent was given. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 228, 634 S.E.2d 231 (2006), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 437</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 896 (2007).

       <p>
        Defendant's right against an unconstitutional search and seizure was not violated when the officers searched defendant's shop as: (1) defendant's girlfriend, who had lived with him for 13 years, consented to the search; (2) the shop was located within the curtilage of the house; (3) the officers had no reason to question the girlfriend's authority to consent to a search of the shop; and (4) the girlfriend's consent was voluntary. State v. Watkins, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 502, 640 S.E.2d 409 (2007), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 436</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 896 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Miranda warnings were not required before defendant consented to a search of a vehicle, and because any error in admitting the fruits of the search was harmless, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 598, 656 S.E.2d 329, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 364</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 743 (2008).

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence detectives seized during a search of an outbuilding that was within the curtilage of defendant's residence after he consented to a search of his property because defendant expressly consented to a search of all of the personal or real property and did not contest that the outbuilding was located within the curtilage of his residence, and the search of the outbuilding was within the scope of consent; the property included the interior of the mobile home and also outbuildings located within the curtilage of the residence, and defendant made no objection to the search of the outbuilding.

        Reasonable Suspicion Found.
   
   - Officer had reasonable suspicion to approach defendant juvenile because defendant screamed an obscenity at him; while merely stating an obscenity to another individual, whether that person is a policeman or a civilian, may be protected speech, an officer is not precluded from approaching any individual who is standing in public and yelling obscenities, as such actions might lead to a breach of the peace.

       <p>
        Officer had reasonable suspicion to approach defendant juvenile and her companions because the officer had something more than reasonable suspicion that defendant was in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa39s14-313ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 14-313(c)</a></cite>; the officer saw defendant smoking a cigarette while carrying a pack of cigarettes in her hand and verified that defendant was only fifteen years old.

        Court of appeals erred in concluding that a police officer lacked reasonable suspicion to detain defendant for questioning and that the trial court erred in denying defendant's suppression motion because the circumstances established a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot; the court of appeals placed undue weight on the officer's subjective interpretation of the facts rather than focusing on how an objective, reasonable officer would have viewed them.

   - Deputy did not have a reasonable suspicion to stop the truck and defendant's motion to suppress was improperly denied because the anonymous tip about a possible drunk driver provided no description of the car in the ditch, the truck used to pull it out, or how many people were involved, and the details in the tip were not sufficient to even establish identifying characteristics, let alone to allow the deputy to corroborate the details; when the deputy passed a car covered in mud and came up behind a truck, he saw no equipment to indicate the truck had pulled, or had been able to pull, a car out of a ditch; and the truck was not operating in violation of the law.

        What Warrants are Prohibited.
   
   - Judicial warrants, general in terms and unsupported by preliminary oath or sworn evidence and for conduct not committed in the immediate presence of the magistrate, are forbidden by the federal Constitution and by this section. Brewer v. Wynne, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. 319</cite>, 79 S.E. 629, 1915B Ann. Cas. 319 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        The general warrants against which this constitutional provision speaks did not specify items to be searched for or persons to be arrested, nor were they supported by showings of probable cause that any particular crime had been committed. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section proscribes warrants that empower officials to search for evidence of a particular offense without specifically naming the person against whom the offense is charged, the particular place to be searched or the items to be seized. Brooks v. Taylor Tobacco Enters., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 529, 251 S.E.2d 656, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 759</cite>, 260 S.E.2d 419 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Anticipatory Warrant
   
   - Three requirements that must be observed before a search is executed pursuant to an anticipatory search warrant: (1) the anticipatory warrant must set out, on its face, explicit, clear, and narrowly drawn triggering events which must occur before execution may take place; (2) those triggering events, from which probable cause arises, must be (a) ascertainable, and (b) preordained, meaning that the property is on a sure and irreversible course to its destination; and finally, (3) no search may occur unless and until the property does, in fact, arrive at that destination. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 588 S.E.2d 497 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        An anticipatory warrant to search the premises when an intercepted package containing contraband was delivered was properly executed where: (1) the warrant clearly established explicit triggering events on its face which were definable and preordained; (2) although the package was no longer in the house when the search occurred, the package was delivered, accepted, and taken into the house by defendant; (3) the delivery of the package linked the house to criminal activity inside, giving rise to probable cause for the search; and (4) the warrant specifically allowed the officers to search the premises to find and seize cocaine generally and to identify the participants of the crime; thus, a trial court correctly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the anticipatory search warrant. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 382, 588 S.E.2d 497 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Anticipatory search warrant sufficiently incorporated by reference the attached affidavit, which clearly identified the triggering events required to execute the warrant, and the two documents could be read together to provide the specificity and particularity required under the U.S. Const., Amend. IV, N.C. Const., Art. I,

       </p>
       <p>
        Anticipatory search warrant, which provided that authority for the search contained in the warrant was not commenced until a confidential informant gave a prearranged signal that marijuana was seen at a residence, was valid because (1) the affidavit supporting the warrant was reliable and the information before a trial court was obtained in a reliable manner because the police were able to independently confirm a number of statements the informant made, and the trial court had information before it as to the informant's year-long history of purchasing drugs from defendant, as well as police officers' testimony that they considered the information reliable; (2) the warrant contained clear triggering events; (3) the triggering events were ascertainable and preordained; and (4) no search could have taken place until after those triggering events occurred. State v. Stallings, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 376, 657 S.E.2d 915, appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 370</cite>, 663 S.E.2d 859 (2008).

       <p>
        Totality of Circumstances Test Adopted.
   
   - For resolving questions arising under this section with regard to the sufficiency of probable cause to support the issuance of a search warrant, the Supreme Court of North Carolina adopts the totality of circumstances test of Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983) and Massachusetts v. Upton, 466 U.S. 727, 104 S. Ct. 2085, 80 L. Ed. 2d 721 (1984) and rejects the two-pronged test of Aguilar v. Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964) and Spinelli v. United States, 393 U.S. 410, 89 S. Ct. 584, 21 L. Ed. 2d 637 (1969). State v. Arrington, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 633</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 254 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the totality of circumstances test, the two prongs of
   <i>
    Aguilar
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    Spinelli
   </i>
   - veracity and basis of knowledge - are still relevant, but are not to be accorded independent status. The task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the "veracity" and "basis of knowledge" of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place. And the duty of the reviewing court is simply to ensure that the magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed. State v. Arrington, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 633</cite>, 319 S.E.2d 254 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Carolina Supreme Court has adopted the "totality of the circumstances" test to determine the sufficiency of probable cause to issue a warrant under this section. State v. Isleib, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 599, 343 S.E.2d 234 (1986), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 634</cite>, 356 S.E.2d 573 (1987).

        After-the-Fact Scrutiny of Affidavit Should Not Be De Novo Review.
   
   - After-the-fact scrutiny by courts of the sufficiency of an affidavit in support of a warrant should not take the form of de novo review. State v. Tuggle, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 392 S.E.2d 654 (1990).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Particular Description of Things to Be Seized Required.
   
   - The requirement that warrants shall particularly describe the things to be seized is to prevent the seizure of one thing under a warrant describing another and to leave nothing to the discretion of the officer executing the warrant in determining what is to be taken. State v. Foye, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 188 S.E.2d 67 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Description of Books.
   
   - The particularity requirement is to be accorded the most scrupulous exactitude when the things to be seized are books and the basis for the seizure is the ideas which they contain. When First Amendment rights are not involved, the specificity requirement is more flexible. State v. Foye, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 188 S.E.2d 67 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Description of Narcotics.
   
   - The words "illegally held narcotic drugs" described the things to be seized with sufficient particularity to prevent the warrant from being a general search warrant within the prohibition of U.S. Const., Amend. IV and this section. State v. Shirley, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 440, 183 S.E.2d 880, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 729</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 885 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The description in the search warrant was particular enough to prevent the warrant from being a general search warrant within the prohibition of U.S. Const., Amend. IV and this section where the affidavit upon which it was based referred only to "narcotic drugs, the possession of which is a crime" and did not describe the things to be seized with more particularity. State v. Foye, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 200, 188 S.E.2d 67 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Incorporation of Affidavit.
   
   - Where an affidavit complied with the provisions of the applicable statute and met the constitutional standard of reasonableness and probable cause requisite to the issuance of a search warrant, the search warrant, by reference to the affidavit, which was made a part of the warrant, described with reasonable certainty the premises to be searched, sufficiently indicated the basis for the finding of probable cause, and sufficiently described the contraband for which the search was to be conducted. State v. Murphy, <cite class="nc_code">15 N.C. App.</cite> 420, 190 S.E.2d 361 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit Sufficient to Find Probable Cause.
   
   - Affidavit stating that a confidential informant (CI) bought cocaine from defendant at defendant's house, that the officer knew and trusted the CI, that the CI made a controlled buy from defendant after meeting with the officer, and that the officer witnessed several hand-to-hand transactions between defendant and visitors to defendant's house, provided probable cause to support the issuance of the search warrant. State v. Stokley, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 336, 646 S.E.2d 640 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 243</cite>, 660 S.E.2d 542 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Police officer's affidavit, based on information from an informant the officer had known for years, was sufficient for the issuance of a search warrant under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa11s15A-244" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-244</a></cite> because under the totality of the circumstances the affidavit provided a magistrate with probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant for defendant's home under U.S. Const., Amend. IV and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 701, 649 S.E.2d 646, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 89</cite>, 656 S.E.2d 281 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant pled guilty to violating, inter alia, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-95ol1d3" target="_blank">G.S. 90-95(d)(3)</a></cite> and (a)(1), 90-113.22, and 90-108(a)(7), he argued unsuccessfully that there was not a nexus between the presence of drugs in his storage unit and the existence of drugs at his house to provide the requisite probable cause for the search warrant of his residence. There was sufficient evidence offered in support of the search warrant for defendant's residence to provide probable cause to believe that contraband would be found in that location, and, given the circumstances of the case, there was no reason to doubt the informant's reliability and basis of knowledge. State v. Washburn, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 685 S.E.2d 555 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 811</cite>, 692 S.E.2d 87 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate had a substantial basis to find that probable cause existed to issue the challenged search warrant, where the affidavit stated that, based on the amount of marijuana found in a car the detective stopped, the occupants appeared to be drug dealers, drug dealers typically keep evidence of drug dealing in their homes, the mother of one of the car's occupants stated that her son lived at defendant's address, and her description of the premises matched the actual premises. State v. Allman, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 292</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 301 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Search warrant was supported by probable cause as required by the Fourth Amendment and this section, as the affidavit listed the officer's training and experience, provided defendant's history of drug-related arrests, and stated that the detective had discovered marijuana residue in the trash from defendant's residence, along with correspondence addressed to defendant. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 360</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 282 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained in a search of defendant's residence was appropriate because, based on an affiant detective's training and experience, the conduct of a middleman in meeting and traveling with a confidential informant to defendant's residence and in entering and returning from the residence in controlled buys by the informant, and the detective's personal observations, a magistrate had a substantial basis to find probable cause existed to believe controlled substances were located at the residence. State v. Frederick, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 814 S.E.2d 855, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 547</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 346, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 912 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrant for the search of a residence was supported by probable cause where the officer's knowledge of a controlled purchase of crack cocaine and her credibility determination of the confidential informant based on previously working with that informant rendered the affidavit sufficient under the totality of the circumstances test. State v. Caddell, - N.C. App.
   - , 833 S.E.2d 400 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable cause existed to support the issuance of a search warrant for defendant's residence because the warrant was issued based on information contained in a law enforcement officer's affidavit relating to the sale of illegal drugs at another location earlier that day by other residents of the home so as to provide a nexus between the residence and suspected criminal activity. The information set out in the affidavit allowed the magistrate to infer that evidence related to the criminal activity was likely to be found at the residence. State v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 332</cite>, 841 S.E.2d 277 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress because the application to obtain defendant's cell-site location information contained all the information necessary from which the trial court could have issued a warrant supported by probable cause, and in fact, the trial court in its order specifically found that probable cause existed to obtain this information. State v. Gore, - N.C. App.
   - , 846 S.E.2d 295 (2020).
       </p>

        Affidavit Insufficient to Find Probable Cause.
   
   - Where the affidavit contained a mere naked assertion that the informant at some time saw a "room full of marijuana" growing in the defendant's house, and the officer affiant made no attempt to corroborate the informant's story, but merely verified that the defendant lived in the house in question, the affidavit did not contain sufficient information on which to find probable cause, nor could the evidence seized as a result of the search be admitted under the "good faith exception" to the exclusionary rule in view of the fact that the officer took no reasonable steps to comply with U.S. Const., Amend. IV. State v. Newcomb, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 92, 351 S.E.2d 565 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant was properly suppressed because, inter alia, the affidavit supporting the search warrant merely stated that the confidential informant had visited the described location and made controlled purchases of cocaine at the location, without particularly stating which, if any, of the two dwellings the informant entered to make the purchases. In addition, the special agent had only been working in law enforcement for two years at the time the agent applied for the search warrant, and failed to include facts regarding whether the agent observed the transactions between the confidential informant and the seller, thereby failing to establish the identity of the seller as defendant. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 587, 664 S.E.2d 421 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit was not sufficient to support a finding of probable cause, because the affiadavit contained false information, including a statement that a new information had proven reliable in the past, when the officer's testimony clearly showed that he had not had any sort of prior relationship with the informant and knew little or nothing about him. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 727 S.E.2d 322 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the totality of the circumstances, the search warrant affidavit for defendant's home failed to provide a substantial basis for the magistrate to conclude that probable cause existed, and therefore the appellate court properly affirmed the trial court's order granting defendant's motion to suppress, because the officers' verification of mundane information, a detective's statements regarding defendant's utility records, and the officers' observations of defendant's gardening supplies were not sufficiently corroborative of the anonymous tip of an indoor marijuana growing operation or otherwise sufficient to establish probable, notwithstanding the officers' professional training and experience. State v. Benters, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 660</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 593 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Detective's affidavit did not allege sufficient facts to support the existence of probable cause to search defendant's residence, which she shared with her boyfriend and his brother, where the circumstances in the affidavit that the boyfriend and his brother were engaged in drug dealing and had lied to officers about where they lived were insufficient to establish probable cause that evidence of illegal activity existed at the residence. State v. Allman, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. App.</cite> 685, 781 S.E.2d 311, rev'd on other grounds, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 1114 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the special agent did not act in bad faith when she submitted her application for a search warrant and attached the affidavit for determination of probable cause, the affidavit failed to establish the required nexus between the object sought, evidence of a clandestine methamphetamine laboratory, and the place to be searched, as there was no evidence that the place alleged was defendant's residence or that any subject objects were there. State v. Parson, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 142, 791 S.E.2d 528 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress where the supporting affidavit provided no indication as to when the alleged criminal activities occurred, and since the affidavit was invalid, any evidence obtained as a result of the search warrant was erroneously admitted at trial; the supporting affidavit to the search warrant application was completely devoid of any indication as to when the events used to establish probable cause occurred. State v. Logan, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (July 6, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit in support of a search warrant application did not provide sufficient facts from which the magistrate could conclude there was probable cause because it did not specify when the purported events occurred nor did it indicate sufficient facts from which the magistrate could reasonably infer the timing of such events; therefore, the search warrant obtained as a result of the affidavit was invalid and resulted in an unreasonable search and seizure. State v. Logan, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (July 6, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Production of Search Warrant.
   
   - Where a search is made under conditions requiring the issuance of a search warrant, and the State attempts, over objection, to justify the search and seizure by the possession of a valid search warrant, the State must produce the search warrant, or if it has been lost, must prove such fact and then introduce evidence to show its contents and regularity on its face, unless the production of the warrant is waived by the accused. State v. McMilliam, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 771</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 202 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Severable Provisions.
   
   - Provisions of warrant which authorized police to search both for drugs and for "stolen goods" were severable, and the police could constitutionally search for the listed drugs or items of the same class, but the warrant could not authorize a general exploratory search of defendant's home and inventory of its contents. State v. Connard, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 327, 344 S.E.2d 568 (1986), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 392</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 238 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Withdrawal of a blood sample from a person is a search subject to protection by this section.
   
   State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 709</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 553 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the state constitution, a search warrant must be issued before a blood sample can be obtained,
   
   unless probable cause and exigent circumstances exist that would justify a warrantless search. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 709</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 553 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Blood Sample Taken Without Consent or Search Warrant Unconstitutional.
   
   - Where defendant was already in custody, obtaining a sample of his blood pursuant to a nontestimonial identification order under Article 14 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 15A</a></cite> (G.S. 15A-271, et seq.), absent his consent or a search warrant, violated his rights under this section to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, and the evidence should have been suppressed. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 709</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 553 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Cumulative Evidence Held to Support Determination.
   
   - Although no single piece of evidence in the affidavit was conclusive, nevertheless, the information from all three pieces was consistent, and their cumulative evidence supported the determination that there was a "fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime" would be found at the defendant's residence. State v. Tuggle, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 164, 392 S.E.2d 654 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Rights Not Violated.
   
   - Where probable cause existed to support issuance of search warrant for defendant's hair, saliva, and blood pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa11s15A-242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-242(4)</a></cite>, the State did not violate the defendant's rights, under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20, by failing to obtain a nontestimonial identification order, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa14s15A-273" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-273</a></cite>, or to provide defendant with the right to counsel during the execution of the search warrant, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa14s15A-279ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-279(d)</a></cite>. State v. Grooms, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 50</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 713 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 838, 122 S. Ct. 93, 151 L. Ed. 2d 54 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        While defendant was an overnight guest in the premises searched pursuant to a search warrant, he did not show that he personally had an expectation of privacy there, or that such an expectation was reasonable; therefore, he had no standing to object to the search of the premises. State v. Sanchez, <cite class="nc_code">147 N.C. App.</cite> 619, 556 S.E.2d 602 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 220</cite>, 560 S.E.2d 358 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        When, after a proper investigatory stop and protective search of defendant's vehicle, money, gloves and headgear from rapes and robberies he had committed were observed in plain view, a magistrate had probable cause to issue warrants to search defendant's home, business, vehicle, and person. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. App.</cite> 130, 595 S.E.2d 213, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 735</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 879 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit Sufficient to Support Finding of Probable Cause Despite Alleged False Statements Contained Therein.
   
   - Affidavit containing allegedly false statements was not invalid where other statements supported finding of probable cause; among other things, the unchallenged statements showed that 20 different sources complained to police about criminal activity at the subject residence and a confidential informant made a controlled buy of cocaine at the residence. State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 165, 628 S.E.2d 796 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Stop of Vehicle After Defendant Turned Away Just Prior to Checkpoint.
   
   - Denial of motion to suppress was upheld as totality of circumstances justified officer's pursuing and stopping defendant's vehicle to inquire as to why defendant turned away before checkpoint. In addition to the fact of defendant's legal turn immediately prior to the checkpoint, the following facts combined to allow the officer to make a reasonable inquiry to determine whether defendant was trying to evade the checkpoint: (1) the late hour; (2) the sudden braking of the truck when defendant crested the hill and could see the checkpoint, to the point that the headlights dipped as the front of the truck dove towards the street; (3) the abruptness of defendant's turn into the nearest apartment parking lot; and (4) defendant's behavior in first backing the truck into one space, pulling out and proceeding towards the parking lot exit, and then re-parking when he spotted the patrol car approaching him. State v. Bowden, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 718, 630 S.E.2d 208 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient Evidence to Support Reasonable Cause.
   
   - Sufficient evidence supported a reasonable cause to believe a search of a residence would produce contraband evidence of defendant's criminal activity. Because of the history and apparent continuous nature of defendant's counterfeit trademark business, evidence that occurred twenty months prior to the execution of the search warrant was not so far removed to be considered stale as a matter of law. State v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 848, 817 S.E.2d 232 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence Sufficient to Support Stop When Not Free to Leave.
   
   - When a deputy turned the deputy's vehicle around and activated the deputy's blue lights after arrival upon the scene and then the defendant stopped walking and voluntarily talked with the deputy, and when the defendant failed to provide a photo identification to the deputy, but provided the defendant's name and address this encounter was properly classified as a stop. The State does not contest that the defendant was seized to implicate the Fourth Amendment or this constitutional provision. A reasonable person would not have felt at liberty to ignore the deputy's presence and the use of blue lights on the deputy's marked vehicle, and continue to walk away. State v. Hester, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 803 S.E.2d 8 (2017).

       No Claim Exists under this Section Where a Different State Remedy Was Available.
   
   - Summary judgment was proper in favor of the defendant city on each of plaintiff's state constitutional claims arising under this section and Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 to 21, 35, and 36, where the plaintiff bus driver had an adequate state tort remedy for her alleged injury resulting from the defendant police officer's conduct. Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 538 S.E.2d 601 (2000).

   19, 20, 21, and 35, based on the officer's alleged use of excessive force, because the fact that the citizen had to overcome the affirmative defense of public officer immunity to succeed on the citizen's tort claims did not negate the claims' adequacy as a remedy, so a direct cause of action under the North Carolina Constitution was not permitted.

       Search and Seizure.
   
   - Where an officer observed defendant drive over a curb, back away from the officer, and reach into a pocket in a location known for drug activity, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officer had reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop and had probable cause to seize a film canister from defendant's pocket during a pat-down for weapons based on, inter alia, defendant's actions, the area's reputation, and the officer's prior experiences.

       Habeas Petitions.
   
   - Ordering two habeas petitioners' release was error where they were held due to an immigration-related process by a sheriff who was a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government. Thus, the court's state law authority to inquire into the lawfulness of petitioners' detentions had been superseded by federal law. Although the trial court had authority to make an initial determination as to its authority, an examination of the applications themselves should have led it to summarily deny the habeas corpus petitions. Chavez v. McFadden, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 458</cite>, 843 S.E.2d 139 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       While a trial judge presented with an application for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus has the authority to determine whether it is entitled to act upon any such petition, it should (1) summarily deny an application seeking the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus that alleges that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer by a sheriff who is a party to a 287(g) agreement with the federal government and (2) deny a petitioner's request for discharge in the event that the return filed by a sheriff who has entered into a 287(g) agreement with the federal government claims that the petitioner is being held pursuant to an immigration-related arrest warrant or detainer.

       Statute Prescribing Inmate Grievance Procedures Upheld.
   
   - Former G.S. 148-113, requiring an inmate to exhaust his administrative remedies before he is entitled to judicial review of a grievance or complaint within the jurisdiction of the Inmate Grievance Commission, did not conflict with constitutional and statutory provisions guaranteeing the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, since former G.S. 148-113 only prescribed the method by which the inquiry into the lawfulness of an inmate's detention is to be conducted.

   - The power of the court to discharge a person acquitted of crime because of insanity upon habeas corpus cannot be made to depend solely upon certification by the superintendents of the several State hospitals that he is sane and safe.

       The principles of this section are dear to every free man;
   
   they are his shield and buckler against wrong and oppression, and lie at the foundation of civil liberty. They are declared to be the rights of the citizens of North Carolina and ought to be vigilantly guarded. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. 66</cite> (1854); State v. Snipes, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 743</cite>, 117 S.E. 500 (1923).

       "Indictment".
   
   - The word "indictment" means indictment by a grand jury as defined by the common law. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 439</cite>, 163 S.E. 581 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "indictment" is used in this section to signify a written accusation of a crime drawn up by the public prosecuting attorney and submitted to the grand jury, and by them found and presented on oath or affirmation as a true bill. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Presentment".
   
   - As to the meaning of the term "presentment," see State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It is an essential of jurisdiction that a criminal offense should be sufficiently charged
   
   in a warrant or an indictment. State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 409</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 770 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A valid indictment is a condition precedent to jurisdiction
   
   of the superior court to determine the guilt or innocence of a defendant and to the authority of the court to render a valid judgment in the matter. State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967); State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 409</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 770 (1968); State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 556</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 457 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section requires a bill of indictment,
   
   unless waived, for all criminal actions originating in the superior court, and a valid bill is necessary to vest the court with authority to determine the question of guilt or innocence. State v. Bissette, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. 514</cite>, 108 S.E.2d 858 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       A valid indictment is essential to the jurisdiction of the court in a criminal case. State v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 541</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 103 (1975); State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 335 S.E.2d 770 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a criminal prosecution where no presentment or impeachment is involved and no waiver of indictment has been made, a valid bill of indictment is essential to the jurisdiction of the court to try defendant for a felony. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 613</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 361 (1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       Order denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence was void because the trial court was without jurisdiction to entertain and rule upon the motion as defendant had not been indicted or waived indictment at the time of the hearing. State v. Wolfe, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 581 S.E.2d 117 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Remand for re-sentencing on felony child abuse inflicting serious physical injury was improper because the indictment failed to allege an essential element required for proof of that crime: that injury be inflicted by a parent or any other person providing care to or supervision of a child less than 16 years of age; however, the indictment and jury verdict did support a conviction for class A1 misdemeanor assault. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 732, 632 S.E.2d 516 (2006).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       One charged with a capital felony may only be prosecuted on an indictment
   
   found by a grand jury. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Indictments are Not Required.
   
   - The provisions of this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24, when read together, empower the legislature to provide means other than indictments by grand juries for the trial of petty misdemeanors, with the right of appeal. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952); State v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 68</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 461 (1956).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional requirement that criminal trials must be upon a bill of indictment is subject to two exceptions: (1) the legislature may provide means other than indictments by grand juries for the trial of petty misdemeanors; and (2) when represented by counsel, an accused may, in all except capital cases, waive indictment under rules prescribed by the legislature. State v. Stevens, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 364</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 521 (1965).
      </p>
      <p>
       District court had jurisdiction to try defendant for operating a motor vehicle with an open container of alcohol while alcohol remained in defendant's system because the citation issued to defendant identified the crime and stated defendant had an open container of alcohol after drinking, (2) defendant filed no motion objecting to the sufficiency of the offense charged in the citation, and (3) any failure to allege facts supporting every element of the offense was not a jurisdictional defect, as the North Carolina Constitution required no grand jury to make a probable cause determination for misdemeanors tried in district court as a jurisdictional prerequisite. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 364, 805 S.E.2d 701 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 548</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 340, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 911 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to affirm a decision upholding an order granting defendant's motion to dismiss because a citation issued for driving while subject to an impairing substance tolled the statute of limitations, and the citation was a constitutionally and statutorily proper criminal pleading that conveyed jurisdiction to the district court to try defendant; because a citation could serve as the charging document for misdemeanors, the purpose of the statute of limitations was satisfied by its issuance. State v. Curtis, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 355</cite>, 817 S.E.2d 187 (2018).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Indictment on Appeal to Superior Court.
   
   - Until the legislature prescribes regulations governing waiver of an indictment in a case heard in superior court on an appeal from an inferior court, an accused in such a case may not waive indictment and be tried upon an information. State v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 169 S.E.2d 32 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Superior court prosecution violated defendant's Constitutional right because due to the State's improper prosecution in superior court, defendant had to appear in that court to seek dismissal of the prosecution and had to appear before the court of appeals following the State's appeal. State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Trial on Appeal in Superior Court May Be Upon Original Accusation.
   
   - Where the General Assembly declares an offense below the grade of felony to be a petty misdemeanor and provides for prosecution of such offense in an inferior court upon accusation other than indictment, and confers upon such inferior court final jurisdiction of such prosecutions subject to the right of appeal to the superior court, the defendant on appeal from conviction in the inferior court may be tried in the superior court upon the original accusation without an indictment; but when there has been no trial in the inferior court, and the prosecution has merely been transferred to the superior court upon defendant's demand for jury trial, trial in the superior court upon the original warrant is a nullity, and a statute providing for such trial is unconstitutional. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       A defendant convicted in a recorder's court having final jurisdiction of the offense charged could be tried in the superior court on appeal upon the original warrant without an indictment. State v. Doughtie, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 228</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 642 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       The superior court has no jurisdiction to try an accused for a specific misdemeanor on the warrant of an inferior court unless he is first tried and convicted for such misdemeanor in the inferior court and appeals to the superior court from the sentence pronounced against him by the inferior court on his conviction for such misdemeanor. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 109</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 189 (1954); State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 596</cite>, 99 S.E.2d 764 (1957); State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 185</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 355 (1957); State v. Guffey, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 94</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 827 (1973); State v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 205 S.E.2d 322 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver of Indictment in Non-Capital Cases.
   
   - One charged with a noncapital felony or with a misdemeanor may be tried initially in the superior court only upon an indictment, except when he is represented by counsel he may be tried upon information signed by the prosecuting attorney when written waiver of indictment by defendant and his counsel appears on the face of the information. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).
      </p>
      <p>
       A person charged with the commission of a misdemeanor cannot be tried initially in the superior court except upon an indictment found by a grand jury, unless he waives indictment in accordance with regulations prescribed by the legislature. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 205</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 602 (1953).
      </p>
      <p>
       By virtue of this section an accused in a criminal proceeding, when represented by counsel, may, in all except capital cases, waive indictment under rules prescribed by the legislature. State v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 622, 169 S.E.2d 32 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court's order denying defendant's motion for appropriate relief was reversed where there was no formal waiver signed by both defendant and his counsel on or attached to the bill of information meeting the statutory requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsVIa32s15A-642ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-642(c)</a></cite>, and thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to accept defendant's guilty plea and enter the original judgment. State v. Nixon, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 823 S.E.2d 689 (2019).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Substantial Alteration of Indictment.
   
   - In a case in which defendant appealed her conviction for negligent child abuse, the appellate court concluded that the trial court committed reversible error during the trial by permitting the State to amend the indictment. The amendment, which constituted a substantial alteration, allowed the jury to convict defendant of conduct not alleged in the original indictment and found by the grand jury. State v. Frazier, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 840, 795 S.E.2d 654, review denied, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 317 (2017).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment must clearly and positively identify the person charged
   
   with the commission of the offense; omission of the name of the defendant, or a sufficient description if his name is unknown, in the body of the indictment, is a fatal and incurable defect. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 613</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 361 (1981).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       All Essential Elements of Offense Must Be Charged.
   
   - An indictment, whether at common law or under a statute, to be good must allege lucidly and accurately all the essential elements of the offense endeavored to be charged. State v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 409</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 770 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the essential elements of the offense must be alleged in an indictment charging a statutory offense. State v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 541</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 103 (1975); State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">77 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 335 S.E.2d 770 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Short Form Murder Indictment Lacking Elements of Premeditation and Deliberation Upheld.
   
   - The court rejected the defendant's argument that because the indictment failed to allege two essential elements of first degree murder, i.e., premeditation and deliberation, his conviction of first degree murder based thereon violated Article I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19, 22 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that the defendant had adequate notice of the charge against him, as North Carolina has for nearly 100 years authorized the use of the short form murder indictment as sufficient to allege the elements of premeditation and deliberation, and the jury was properly required to find those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 530 S.E.2d 562 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment is constitutionally sufficient if it apprises defendant of the charge
   
   against him with enough certainty to enable him to prepare his defense and to protect him from subsequent prosecution for the same offense. The indictment must also enable the court to know what judgment to pronounce in case of conviction. State v. Lowe, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 596</cite>, 247 S.E.2d 878 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       If an indictment charges the offense in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner
   
   and contains averments sufficient to enable the court to proceed to judgment, and to bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense, it is sufficient. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Offenses Which Indictment Will Support.
   
   - Remand for sentencing and entry of judgment for attempted voluntary manslaughter was appropriate because, although the indictment against defendant for attempted first-degree murder failed to include the essential element of malice aforethought, the jury's guilty verdict of attempted first-degree murder necessarily meant that they found all of the elements of the lesser-included offense of attempted voluntary manslaughter. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 762 S.E.2d 894 (2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of Statutory Language.
   
   - An indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient as a general rule when it charges the offense in the language of the statute. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Aggravating Circumstances for the Death Penalty.
   
   - Heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating circumstance under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1e9" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(e)(9)</a></cite> was argued to be unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, and that that vagueness could not be cured through appellate narrowing after Ring; although the issue was not raised in the lower court so as to be properly addressed on appeal, the highest court found the issue to be in the public interest, addressed the issue to further develop its jurisprudence under N.C. R. App. P. 2, and determined that the circumstance was constitutional under the Sixth Amendment because (1) the pattern jury instructions included language approved by the Court that narrowed the definition of the circumstance, and (2) the appellate review of the circumstance as submitted to the jury did not make the appellate court a "co-finder of fact" with the jury. State v. Duke, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 110</cite>, 623 S.E.2d 11 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Aggravating Circumstances of Capital Offense Need Not Be Alleged.
   
   - The defendant's murder indictment complied with the requirements of this section and did not violate his constitutional rights; because defendant had notice that he was charged with first degree murder and the elements thereof, as well as his eligibility for the death penalty, the State was not required to allege the supporting aggravating circumstances. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 18 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 910, 122 S. Ct. 250, 151 L. Ed. 2d 181 (2001), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 854</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 854 (2005).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Requirement to Instruct Indicting Grand Jury on Elements of Crime.
   
   - A court is not required to instruct the indicting grand jury on the elements of the crime in question. State v. Treadwell, <cite class="nc_code">99 N.C. App.</cite> 769, 394 S.E.2d 245 (1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An indictment returned by a grand jury not legally constituted is not a valid indictment.
   
   State v. Yoes, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 616</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 386 (1967); State v. Ray, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 556</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 457 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Dismissal When Indictment Is Invalid.
   
   - When the indictment charging defendant with the commission of crime is invalid, defendant's motion to dismiss the action for want of jurisdiction should be allowed. State v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 318</cite>, 180 S.E. 598 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       While defendant abandoned error as to one of the six challenged indictments filed against him, each alleging charges of first-degree sexual offense, the trial court erred in failing to dismiss the remaining five upon defendant's motion as fatally defective, given that they erroneously charged two similar but distinct crimes and effectively charged neither. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 647 S.E.2d 475 (2007), rev'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 169</cite>, 655 S.E.2d 831 (2008), State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 647 S.E.2d 475 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where Proceedings Are Invalid.
   
   - This section means action by the grand jury according to the practice at common law, and does not permit open hearings before the grand jury. Thus, where the court sent for the grand jury and permitted the solicitor to examine a State's witness in open court before the grand jury, after the grand jury had returned two identical bills of indictment against the defendant, submitted on successive days, "not a true bill," and thereafter the solicitor submitted another identical bill to the grand jury which was returned "a true bill," defendant's verified plea in abatement and motion to quash, made before pleading, should have been allowed, and upon appeal from the court's denial of the motion the judgment would be reversed, with leave to the solicitor to send another bill before a different grand jury, if so advised. State v. Ledford, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 724</cite>, 166 S.E. 917 (1932).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where defendant was tried at a special term of criminal court upon an indictment returned by a grand jury drawn for the special term, but there was no order by the Governor that a grand jury be drawn for such term as provided by former G.S. 7-78, defendant's motion in arrest of judgment, made for the first time in the Supreme Court upon appeal, would be allowed pursuant to this section. State v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 90</cite>, 179 S.E. 450 (1935). See also, State v. Boykin, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 407</cite>, 191 S.E. 18 (1937).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It is competent to send as many bills of indictment as may be necessary
   
   to the grand jury to get before them necessary witnesses and evidence from which they may decide the propriety of submitting the accused to trial. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 249</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 691 (1946); State v. Mercer, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 371</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 866 (1959).

      <p>
       Assault with Deadly Weapon.
   
   - A justice of the peace had no jurisdiction of an assault with a deadly weapon except to bind the defendant over, and by the provisions of this section, the superior court could proceed to trial only upon indictment duly found and returned. State v. Myrick, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 688</cite>, 163 S.E. 803 (1932). See also, State v. Clegg, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 675</cite>, 200 S.E. 371 (1939).

      <p>
       Attempted Murder Indictment.
   
   - Where defendant's indictment for attempted first degree murder was deficient, under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   22 and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a15s15-144" target="_blank">G.S. 15-144</a></cite>, because it omitted phrase "and of his malice aforethought," the appellate court, after defendant was convicted by a jury of attempted first degree murder, arrested the judgment and remanded the matter for sentencing and the entry of judgment for attempted voluntary manslaughter, which the indictment supported; the failure of the criminal pleading to charge the essential elements of the stated offense was an error of law that could be corrected upon appellate review even though no corresponding objection, exception, or motion was made in the trial division. State v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 574 S.E.2d 17, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 64</cite>, 579 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 540 U.S. 928, 124 S. Ct. 338, 157 L. Ed. 2d 231 (2003).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the original indictment charging defendant with attempted first-degree murder was constitutionally and statutorily sufficient to provide jurisdiction, allege attempted voluntary manslaughter, and was not fatally defective, no manifest necessity existed to declare a mistrial over defendant's objections, the State was barred from re-indicting defendant on attempted murder or manslaughter and the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion to dismiss the subsequent indictment. Therefore, defendant's double jeopardy rights were violated by his subsequent indictment, prosecution, trial, and conviction of attempted first-degree murder. State v. Schalow, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 334, 795 S.E.2d 567 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Short-form indictment was sufficient to vest the trial court with subject-matter jurisdiction over the attempted first-degree murder charge because the prosecution properly included the legal element of malice aforethought; and, despite the usage of the term "slay" instead of the term "murder," the short-form indictment provided such certainty in the statement of the accusation as would identify the offense with which defendant was charged. State v. Tart, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 73</cite>, 824 S.E.2d 837 (2019).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Kidnapping.
   
   - An indictment charging that defendant "unlawfully, did feloniously and forcibly kidnap" a person named was not defective for failure to charge additionally that the victim was forcibly carried away against her will. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A preliminary hearing
   
   is not a constitutional requirement nor is it essential to the finding of an indictment. State v. Hairston, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 220</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 633, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 888, 93 S. Ct. 194, 34 L. Ed. 2d 145 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Motion to Suppress Properly Denied.
   
   - Because defendant's initial seizure and incarceration were not unconstitutional, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress the evidence seized from defendant's person. State v. Hocutt, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 628 S.E.2d 832 (2006).

        Search and Seizure.
   
   - Where an officer observed defendant drive over a curb, back away from the officer, and reach into a pocket in a location known for drug activity, defendant's motion to suppress was properly denied because the officer had reasonable suspicion to make an investigatory stop and had probable cause to seize a film canister from defendant's pocket during a pat-down for weapons based on, inter alia, defendant's actions, the area's reputation, and the officer's prior experiences. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 454, 658 S.E.2d 501 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which the trial court granted defendant's motion to suppress finding that his arrest was illegal and as such was a violation of his right to be free from unreasonable seizures, the State appealed, arguing successfully that the trial court erred in basing its decision on whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave during the interaction, rather than determining whether there existed special circumstances which would justify a law enforcement officer's actions, and whether those actions were the least intrusive means of carrying out the purpose of the stop. The trial court had to determine whether special circumstances existed that would have justified the officer's use of handcuffs such that they remained the least intrusive means reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of the stop. State v. Carrouthers, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 415, 683 S.E.2d 781 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Counsel May Assist Prosecuting Attorney.
   
   - The trial court has discretionary power to allow private counsel to assist the prosecuting attorney in the trial of a case, it being the duty of the court to permit only such assistance as fairness and justice may require, and such power does not impinge on the provisions of this section. State v. Carden, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 404</cite>, 183 S.E. 898, cert. denied, 298 U.S. 682, 56 S. Ct. 960, 80 L. Ed. 1402 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prejudicial Argument.
   
   - In a capital case, any argument made by the prosecuting attorney or by private prosecution appearing for the State which suggests to the jury that they can depend upon either judicial or executive review to correct any errors in their verdict and to share their responsibility for it is an abuse of privilege and is prejudicial to the defendant. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 395</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 445 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's contention that district attorney's argument to the jury referring repeatedly to the fact that defense counsel was from another part of the State constituted prejudicial error and denied defendant due process and the effective assistance of counsel would be overruled where defense counsel had opened the door with abusive comments attacking the credibility of two State witnesses and the honesty of two local law-enforcement officers. State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 512</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 303, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 912, 97 S. Ct. 301, 50 L. Ed. 2d 278 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant's constitutional rights under Article I, Sections 19, 23, and 27 of the North Carolina Constitution were not violated by the prosecution's argument in opposition to the "catchall" mitigating circumstance of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1f" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(f)</a></cite> that the jury should not give any mitigating value to the fact that his accomplice was not sentenced to death where the prosecution did not imply that the accomplice's sentence could be treated as a nonstatutory aggravating circumstance. State v. Roseboro, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 536</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1019, 121 S. Ct. 582, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Non-Prejudicial Argument.
   
   - Prosecutor's arguments, including statements comparing defendant's cozy life in prison and his numerous protections under the Constitution with victims' lack of opportunities, was unlikely to have influenced the jury's sentencing recommendations and, therefore, did not deny defendant his constitutional due process rights. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Informing Defendant of His Rights.
   
   - Defendant was not "in custody" for Miranda purposes as a reasonable person in defendant's position would have concluded he was free to terminate the interviews if he so chose. State v. Corbett, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 313</cite>, 451 S.E.2d 252 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Present a Defense.
   
   - Trial court did not err by excluding the testimony of a doctor under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 404, because his testimony did not constitute evidence of the decedent's character for violence, but rather testified that the decedent was an angry person who had thoughts of violence. Because the trial court's exclusion of the expert's testimony was within the bounds of the rules of evidence, defendant's right to present a defense under U.S. Const., amend. VI and this section was not violated. State v. McGrady, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 753 S.E.2d 361 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred by excluding the testimony of three character witnesses pertaining to the victim's past specific instances of violent conduct because the testimony was permitted under this section as defendant claimed he acted in self-defense, and the exclusion of the evidence denied defendant his constitutional right to present a complete defense. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 802 S.E.2d 477 (2017), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 535</cite>, 819 S.E.2d 322 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        State Cannot Violate Right to Prove Element of Charge Against Defendant.
   
   - State cannot violate defendant's right against self-incrimination to prove an element of charges against defendant. State v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 528, 808 S.E.2d 450 (2017), appeal dismissed, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 318 (2018), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 493</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 532 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was denied a new trial on the sexual exploitation of a minor convictions because defendant's age was not an element of that offense. State v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. App.</cite> 528, 808 S.E.2d 450 (2017), appeal dismissed, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 318 (2018), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">372 N.C. 493</cite>, 831 S.E.2d 532 (2019).

        Right to Testify.
   
   - The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 provide a criminal defendant with the right to testify, but do not place upon the trial court the duty of informing a pro se or represented defendant of this right; the trial court did not err by not asking defendant whether he wished to present evidence or testify on his own behalf after defense counsel told the court that defendant would offer no evidence. State v. Murray, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 631, 572 S.E.2d 845 (2002), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 467</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 778 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial by denying the defendant's pre-trial motion to continue
   
   the trial to a date more than 20 days after the defendant was charged in a true bill of indictment with habitual felon status; the assistant district attorney handling the case, notified the court that the State was not going to proceed with the habitual felon charge until a later date, if at all, and after the jury verdict was announced, the State dismissed the defendant's habitual felon indictment so that defendant was sentenced solely on the substantive charges against the defendant. State v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 576 S.E.2d 377, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 166</cite>, 580 S.E.2d 698 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When a motion to continue is based on a constitutional right, the trial court's ruling becomes a question of law
   
   and, upon appeal, it is subject to review by examination of the particular circumstances as presented by the record, and the denial of a motion to continue, regardless of its nature, is grounds for a new trial only upon a showing by defendant that the denial was erroneous and that his case was prejudiced as a result of the error. If the error amounts to a constitutional violation, as is here contended, there is prejudice requiring a new trial unless the State satisfies this court that the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 591</cite>, 369 S.E.2d 593 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Impartial Jury and Fair Trial.
   
   - Trial court's failure to question the jurors about the third jury note did not violate defendant's right to an impartial jury and a fair trial because the jury's safety concern did not arise from an improper and prejudicial matter. State v. Mackey, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 774 S.E.2d 382 (2015).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Instructions.
   
   - Pattern jury instruction used by trial court was internally consistent and meaningful, and did not misuse the term "extenuating," nor define the term "mitigating circumstance" in such a way as to confuse jurors or violate the defendant's due process and fundamental fairness rights. State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 518</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 131 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1164, 120 S. Ct. 1181, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        While trial court's jury instructions may have been confusing initially, the court ultimately set forth the required elements as to felonious assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and, therefore, did not violate the defendant's constitutional rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I, Sections 19 and 27. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional rights where no conflict existed between the "Issues and Recommendation as to Punishment" form and the oral instructions given by the trial court. State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 518</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 131 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1164, 120 S. Ct. 1181, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (2000).

       <p>
        Instruction Informing Jury of Death Sentence.
   
   - Denial of defendant's written request for an instruction that "should you [the jury] return a verdict of guilty to the alleged crime of rape, the death penalty will be imposed by this Court" did not deny him his constitutional right of due process as guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amends. V and XIV and by N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 and 36 and this section, since the record revealed that each juror knew that the sentence of death would be imposed upon the return of a verdict of guilty. State v. Bernard, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 321</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 327 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Pecuniary Gain Instruction Not Violative of Constitutional Rights.
   
   - Jury instruction regarding capital felony committed for pecuniary gain to support submission of aggravating circumstance under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXVa100s15A-2000ol1e6" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-2000(e)(6)</a></cite> did not violate defendant's due process and fair trial rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19 although the gun may have been intended for his personal use, it had pecuniary value. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Error in conducting an informal meeting in chambers to discuss jury instructions,
   
   outside the presence of defendant, prior to the formal charge conference held in open court, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Brogden, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 534</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 158 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bench Conferences.
   
   - Where the trial court reconstructed the substance of the bench conferences with the prospective jurors for the record and, before ruling, gave the defendant an opportunity to be heard, these exchanges at the bench which constituted reversible error did not deprive the defendant of his constitutional right to be present at every state of the proceeding. State v. Ali, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 394</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 183 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although trial court held private, unrecorded, sidebar conferences with a number of jury pool members, because these conferences took place prior to the commencement of defendant's trial, no error, constitutional or otherwise, was committed. State v. Rannels, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 644</cite>, 430 S.E.2d 254 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's Contacts with Jurors.
   
   - The transcript lent support to contention that the trial judge did in fact go to the grand jury room to instruct the prospective jurors that they were at break; however, there was no prejudicial error based on this contact. State v. Gay, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 467</cite>, 434 S.E.2d 840 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Fair Trial Abridged by Trial Court's Comments.
   
   - Defendant was entitled to a new trial, as the trial court's extraneous comments regarding defense counsel, including a statement to the effect that "13 people" would get sick if defense counsel explored the same point one more time and that defense counsel was acting unethically regarding a witness statement given to police that the defense counsel referred to but which was not admitted into evidence, were improper and suggested the trial court was favoring the State in defendant's assault trial; since the comments were made in front of the jury, defendant was entitled to a new trial on the charge. State v. Brinkley, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 583 S.E.2d 335 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions were reversed as a trial court made comments that deprived defendant of a fair trial and violated his rights to due process when the trial court, inter alia: (1) sustained the trial court's own objections and refused to allow defendant to continue to question the state's star witness about the witness's use of a false identification; (2) admonished defense counsel when counsel attempted to question the witness about the witness's criminal record; (3) chided counsel when the trial court ruled on the state's objections; and (4) scolded counsel outside the presence of the jury when counsel attempted to make a record of the answers to questions that the trial court would not allow counsel to ask in the jury's presence. State v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 640 S.E.2d 770 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Swearing of Prospective Jurors.
   
   - Defendant had no right to be presen't when prospective jurors were preliminarily sworn, oriented and qualified for jury service in general, without regard to any particular case or trial. State v. Workman, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 482</cite>, 476 S.E.2d 301 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The common law does not recognize a right of discovery
   
   in criminal cases. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S. Ct. 868, 47 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Destruction of Evidence.
   
   - Destruction of marijuana by the State for lack of storage facilities, where the State made random samples, photographs and a copy of the laboratory report available to defendants, did not violate defendants' rights of confrontation under this section, nor infringe defendants' due process rights under the federal and State Constitutions. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 602, 292 S.E.2d 163, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 559</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 372 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the State destroyed a knife that was involved in defendant's alleged crimes after defendant's convictions were affirmed, defendant's due process rights were not violated because (1) defendant never claimed the evidence was destroyed in bad faith, and, (2) despite the knife's unavailability, defense counsel was able to elicit impeaching testimony from the State's witnesses concerning the knife. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 488</cite>, 724 S.E.2d 492 (2012).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        One who is detained under a charge of driving under the influence
   
   has the same constitutional and statutory rights, including the rights given under this section, as any other accused. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Revocation of Driver's License Cannot Constitute Double Jeopardy.
   
   - Revocation of defendant's driver's license did not constitute criminal punishment and, thus, defendant's conviction for driving while impaired did not violate N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 and 23. State v. Hinchman, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 666 S.E.2d 199 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of access to a witness to a breathalyzer test when the State's sole evidence of the offense of driving while impaired is the personal observations of the authorities
   
   would constitute a flagrant violation of defendant's constitutional right to obtain witnesses under this section as a matter of law and would require that the charges be dismissed. State v. Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 513, 369 S.E.2d 378, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 367</cite>, 373 S.E.2d 551 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonsupport.
   
   - In a prosecution under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.049.html#t49a01s49-2" target="_blank">G.S. 49-2</a></cite>, a verdict upon the issues of paternity and nonsupport, if resolved in favor of the State, is sufficient to support a judgment against defendant without a general verdict by the jury of guilty. This does not contravene the provisions of this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24, requiring trial and verdict by jury in criminal cases. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Interrogation.
   
   - Second interrogation of a defendant was not unconstitutional under the facts of the case, and the trial court did not err by admitting the statement obtained by law enforcement officials during that second interrogation because uncontradicted evidence introduced during the suppression hearing supported the conclusion that the law enforcement officials involved in the investigation of one incident honored the defendant's invocation of his right to remain silent regarding another incident, and thereafter no questioning touched on that other incident and fresh Miranda warnings were given. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 620 S.E.2d 204 (2005), vacated in part, rev'd in part, on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 565</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 841 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Failure to Request Competency Hearing or Make Motion Regarding Competency Waived Due Process Claim.
   
   - Defendant waived the claim that defendant's right to due process was violated when the trial court failed to ensure that defendant had the mental capacity to understand the nature and object to the proceedings, to consult with counsel, and to assist in her defense, because defendant did not request a competency hearing or make a motion detailing the conduct resulting in a question as to defendant's capacity to proceed after defendant's was not given anti-anxiety medication on one day of trial. State v. Goode, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 677 S.E.2d 507 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Rebuttal of Insanity Defense with Psychiatric Evidence.
   
   - A fair opportunity to rebut a defendant's insanity defense may include more than one psychiatric examination of the defendant. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant relies on the insanity defense and introduces expert testimony on his mental status, the prosecution may introduce expert testimony derived from prior court-ordered psychiatric examinations for the purpose of rebutting that testimony without implicating U.S. Const., Amend. V or this section of the Constitution of North Carolina. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's absence during the final two hours of jury deliberations,
   
   did not result in substantial and irreparable prejudice to her case and was harmless error with regard to denying her the constitutional right to be present at every stage of her trial. State v. Webster, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 72, 431 S.E.2d 808, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 180</cite>, 438 S.E.2d 206 (1993), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 674</cite>, 447 S.E.2d 349 (1994), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 180</cite>, 438 S.E.2d 206 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to be present at every stage of the trial
   
   was not violated. State v. May, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 609</cite>, 434 S.E.2d 180 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1198, 114 S. Ct. 1310, 127 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge's ex parte interrogations of two seated jurors, conferences with counsel in chambers, out of the presence of the defendant, and the judge's failure to reconstruct those actions in the defendant's presence violated the defendant's right to be present at every stage; however, because the court found that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant was not entitled to a new trial. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 345</cite>, 471 S.E.2d 379 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1061, 117 S. Ct. 695, 136 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not violate the defendant's right to a fair trial because the defendant's trial had not commenced when the court held unrecorded bench conferences and deferred five jurors before the trial court began defendant's trial. The five jurors were not excused at a stage of the defendant's trial, and the defendant did not have the right to be present at the conferences. State v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 573 S.E.2d 668 (2002).

        Although defendant's constitutional right to be present at every stage of defendant's criminal trial was violated when the trial court refused to allow defense counsel to review jury questions, the violation of that right was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt; the record revealed that the questions indicated that the jury had already agreed unanimously on second-degree murder, which was defendant's ultimate conviction, and was confused about whether their rejection of first-degree murder had to be unanimous. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 654 S.E.2d 730 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Error in excluding defendant from an in-chambers conference prior to the sentencing hearing was harmless, because defendant was given an opportunity to be heard at the hearing and the trial court reported the class level for each offense and any aggravating and mitigating factors on the record in open court. State v. Wright, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. App.</cite> 640, 711 S.E.2d 797 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the trial court's failure to disclose the third jury note violated defendant's right to presence, defendant was not prejudiced because had the trial court disclosed the note and defendant had renewed his objection under N.C. R. Evid. 403, the trial court would not have had any reason to change its ruling admitting the inmate's testimony of defendant's confession and threats to potential witnesses. State v. Mackey, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 774 S.E.2d 382 (2015).

       <p>
        Failure to Include Defendant in Discussion Regarding Removal of Leg Shackles.
   
   - Even if trial judge's conversation with defendant's standby counsel, held outside defendant's presence, concerning whether or not to remove his leg shackles constituted a "stage" in the proceeding, the error in excluding defendant was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 560, 518 S.E.2d 222 (1999), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 119</cite>, 541 S.E.2d 468 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's announcement of his ruling in open court could not reasonably be characterized as a hearing,
   
   much less one at which defendant's presence was required where judge simply took a final step in the process of deciding whether to release any part of defendant's prison records to the prosecution and announced his decision from the bench. State v. Rich, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 50</cite>, 484 S.E.2d 394, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1002, 118 S. Ct. 573, 139 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1997).

        <b>
         Defendant's Rights to Due Process or Effective Assistance of Counsel Not Violated.
        </b>
        - Defendant failed to establish at the pretrial hearing that the denial of his motion for a continuance would violate his right to due process or the effective assistance of counsel, as he did not argue at the pretrial hearing that the trial of the charges was unusual or complex and the charges all arose from a single incident of high speed driving. State v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 800 S.E.2d 734 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial Court Did Not Deprive the Defendant of a Fair Trial by Denying the Defendant's Motion for a Mistrial.
   
   - Defendant was not denied his rights to confrontation, to effective assistance of counsel, to due process, to a jury trial, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when the trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial based on the alleged misconduct of a juror; the juror's inadvertent failure to disclose 40-year-old information she had forgotten did not amount to concealment, and the juror demonstrated no bias. State v. Maske, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 40</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 521 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Intervene Ex Mero Motu.
   
   - Defendant's rights to due process and a fair trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   18, 19, 23, 24, and 27 were not violated by the trial court's failure to intervene ex mero motu in the prosecutor's closing argument, as while comparisons between criminal defendants and animals were strongly disfavored, the state's use of an analogy to animals in packs helped explain the complex legal theory surrounding premeditation and deliberation. State v. Oakes, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 703 S.E.2d 476, review denied and dismissed <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 197</cite>, 709 S.E.2d 918, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 541 (2011).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Remain Silent Not Violated.
   
   - State's cross-examination of defendant and its closing argument did not violate defendant's right to remain silent; it was not apparent that the State was commenting on post-Miranda silence when the State asked defendant "So, you didn't want to tell them (the police) that you had acted in self-defense?" In addition, the closing argument was not improper and was supported by witnesses' testimony. State v. Herndon, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 629 S.E.2d 170 (2006), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 539</cite>, 634 S.E.2d 542 (2006).

       <p>
        Defense Counsel Not Ineffective for Failing to Object Where Testimony Properly Admitted.
   
   - Testimony regarding an officer's interaction with a detective and a third individual was non-hearsay since it was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show how the officer formed a reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in the robbery at issue, which in turn justified including defendant's photo in a lineup shown to the robbery victim; since this testimony was properly admitted, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to it. State v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 628 S.E.2d 434 (2006), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 358</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 357 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial counsel's failure to object to the admission of testimony of a director of a rape crisis center about the general reactions and characteristics of sexual assault victims was not ineffective assistance of counsel as defendant failed to show that trial counsel's failure to object fell below a standard of reasonableness, or that the trial result would have been different absent the error. State v. Simmons, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 662 S.E.2d 559 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Rights Not Violated.
   
   - It was error to hold that the State violated defendant's rights under the Constitution because as a result of the State's improper prosecution in superior court, defendant had to appear in that court to seek dismissal of the prosecution and had to appear before the court of appeals following the State's appeal State v. Baker, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 221, 822 S.E.2d 902 (2018).

       <p>
        Purpose of the provision guaranteeing the right to be informed
   
   of the accusation is to enable the defendant to have a fair and reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense, to avail himself of his conviction or acquittal as a bar to subsequent prosecution for the same offense, and to enable the court, on conviction, to pronounce sentence according to law.

        Section Embodies Common-Law Rule.
   
   - This constitutional guaranty is, in essence, an embodiment of the common-law rule requiring the charge against the accused to be set out in the indictment or warrant with sufficient certainty to identify the offense with which he is sought to be charged, protect him from being twice put in jeopardy for the same offense, enable him to prepare for trial, and enable the court to proceed to judgment according to law in case of conviction. State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 396</cite>, 77 S.E.2d 796 (1953); State v. Nugent, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 100</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 781 (1955).

        When Jeopardy Attaches for Dismissed Charges.
   
   - Jeopardy attached with respect to charges dismissed by the State at the close of its evidence. State v. Poston, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 591 S.E.2d 898 (2004).
   <br />

       <p>
        It is an essential of jurisdiction that a criminal offense shall be sufficiently charged
   
   in a warrant or an indictment. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 711</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 849 (1961).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Must Allege All Essential Elements of Offense.
   
   - An indictment, whether at common law or under a statute, to be good must allege lucidly and accurately all the essential elements of the offense sought to be charged. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 711</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 849 (1961); State v. Sutton, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 188 S.E.2d 596 (1972).

        An indictment charging a statutory offense must allege all of the essential elements of the offense. State v. Crabtree, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 541</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 103 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment Must Be Sufficient to Protect Defendant Against Subsequent Prosecution.
   
   - The allegations in a bill of indictment must particularize the crime charged and be sufficiently explicit to protect defendant against a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 711</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 849 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Special Form or Particular Words are Not Required.
   
   - This section does not require that the accused be informed of the charge against him in any special form or particular words, except that it must be by presentment or indictment. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 318</cite>, 85 S.E. 7 (1915); State v. Carpenter, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 767</cite>, 92 S.E. 373 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since no conclusion could be reached by reading the indictment other than that defendant was in custody at the time he allegedly committed malicious conduct by a prisoner, the trial court had jurisdiction over his case, as the State adequately alleged the offense such that defendant was notified of the offense against which he was called to defend. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 622 S.E.2d 204 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 365</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 188 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment that charges in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner
   
   the criminal offense the accused is put to answer affords the protection guaranteed by this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   22. State v. Helms, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 740</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 241 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        If an indictment charges the offense in a plain, intelligible and explicit manner and contains averments sufficient to enable the court to proceed to judgment, and to bar a subsequent prosecution for the same offense, it is sufficient. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficiency of Charging Offense in Words of Statute.
   
   - While it is a general rule prevailing in this State that an indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient if the offense be charged in the words of the statute, the rule is inapplicable where the words of the statute do not in themselves inform the defendant of the specific offense of which he is accused so as to enable him to prepare his defense or plead his conviction or acquittal as a bar to further prosecution for the same offense, as where the statute characterizes the offense in mere general or generic terms, or does not sufficiently define the crime or set forth all its essential elements. In such situation, the statutory words must be supplemented by other allegations which so plainly, intelligibly and explicitly set forth every essential element of the offense as to leave no doubt in the mind of the defendant and the court as to the offense intended to be charged. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 711</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 849 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment for a statutory offense is sufficient as a general rule when it charges the offense in the language of the statute. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court rejected the defendant's argument that because the indictment failed to allege two essential elements of first degree murder, i.e., premeditation and deliberation, his conviction of first degree murder based thereon violated Article I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19, 22 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution. The court found that the defendant had adequate notice of the charge against him, as North Carolina has for nearly 100 years authorized the use of the short form murder indictment as sufficient to allege the elements of premeditation and deliberation, and the jury was properly required to find those elements beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 530 S.E.2d 562 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's indictment included the critical language found in the statute, alleging that he failed to meet his obligation to report, and this language was consistent with that found in the charging statute and provided defendant sufficient notice to prepare a defense; additional detail about the reporting requirement was neither needed nor required, and thus the indictment was valid and conferred jurisdiction upon the trial court. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 620</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 268 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Relationship of Dates of Alleged Offenses Listed in Indictment to Double Jeopardy.
   
   - If, as the general rule provides, the date of an offense is not material, then the critical issue is whether there is an indictment for each alleged offense; when there is a corresponding number of indictments and offenses, then double jeopardy would only be a concern if the dates on the indictment are material. State v. Poston, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 591 S.E.2d 898 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent evidence of the same number of incidents as indictments, time would have a most important effect upon the punishment, because a defendant will have received two consecutive terms of imprisonment for identical offenses based upon the same act, in violation of defendant's Fifth Amendment right not to be twice tried for the same offense. State v. Poston, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 591 S.E.2d 898 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The time fixed in a bill of indictment
   
   usually is not an essential fact, and generally the State may prove that the crime was committed on another date; but when the State fixes the date in the indictment and the defendant presents evidence of an alibi relating to that date, time becomes of the essence, and the State may not, after the defendant has presented his alibi evidence and rested his case, introduce evidence tending to show the defendant's commission of the crime charged on another date. To permit a conviction on such evidence would violate rights guaranteed by this section. State v. Vincent, <cite class="nc_code">35 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 241 S.E.2d 390 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Testing Sufficiency of Warrant or Indictment.
   
   - A motion to quash is a proper method of testing the sufficiency of a warrant or an indictment to charge a criminal offense. State v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 711</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 849 (1961).

        Aggravating Circumstances of Capital Offense Need Not Be Alleged.
   
   - The defendant's murder indictment complied with the requirements of this section and did not violate his constitutional rights; because defendant had notice that he was charged with first degree murder and the elements thereof, as well as his eligibility for the death penalty, the State was not required to allege the supporting aggravating circumstances. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 18 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 910, 122 S. Ct. 250, 151 L.

       <p>
        State-court murder indictments are not required to allege the aggravating circumstances to be presented against capital defendants. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 257</cite>, 582 S.E.2d 593, cert. denied, 539 U.S. 985, 124 S. Ct. 44, 156 L. Ed. 2d 702 (2003).

        A warrant or indictment charging dissemination or possession of obscenity

        Indictment for Larceny and Receiving Stolen Goods.
   
   - Defendant had a constitutional right to have a bill of indictment for larceny and receiving stolen goods state the kind of property he was alleged to have taken or received, so that he could know precisely what he was called upon to meet, in order to have a fair and reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense, and so that, in the event of a conviction, the record might show with accuracy the exact offense of which he was convicted. The use of the embrasive word "meat" in the bill of indictment deprived the defendant of this substantial constitutional right. State v. Nugent, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 100</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 781 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an indictment for larceny, the description "automobile parts . . . of one Furches Motor Company" sufficiently identified the property alleged to have been stolen, as the description identified the type of parts and the owner from whom they were taken. State v. Foster, <cite class="nc_code">10 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 177 S.E.2d 756 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for larceny, the property alleged to have been taken should be described by the name usually applied to it in its condition at that time, and, if possible, the number, kind, quality, and other distinguishing features. State v. Hartley, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 249 S.E.2d 453 (1978), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 738</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 179 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where warrant which charged defendant with breaking and entering
   
   for the purpose of threatening to kill charged only a misdemeanor, and where defendant received his first notice that he was charged with breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny when the indictment was returned on the day of the trial, defendant was forced into a trial for which he was not allowed sufficient time to prepare his defense. State v. Smathers, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 226</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 112 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Fatal Variance Between Warrant and State's Evidence.
   
   - There was no fatal variance between a warrant and the State's evidence at trial on a charge of assaulting a government officer, as evidence showed the officer was performing the official act of arresting defendant when defendant assaulted the officer; whether the arrest was for communicating threats or for being intoxicated and disruptive in public was immaterial. State v. Roman, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. App.</cite> 730, 692 S.E.2d 431 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Kidnapping.
   
   - An indictment charging that defendant "unlawfully, did feloniously and forcibly kidnap" a person named was not defective or violative of N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   22 or this section for failure to charge additionally that the victim was forcibly carried away against her will. State v. Norwood, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 424</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 253 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge to Jury Held to Violate Section.
   
   - A charge to the jury which virtually put the defendant upon trial for an additional offense to that named in the bill, namely, conspiring with others than those alleged, violated the provisions of this section that "in all criminal prosecutions every man has the right to be informed of the accusation against him." State v. Mickey, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 608</cite>, 178 S.E. 220 (1935).

        <b>
         Indictment Properly Dismissed.
        </b>
        - In defendant's conviction for robbery with firearm, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss the indictment based on the State's withholding of evidence favorable to defendant, as any possible violation of defendant's rights was completely cured and without prejudice. State v. Geddie, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Feb. 18, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal to Superior Court.
   
   - The superior court has no jurisdiction to try an accused for a specific misdemeanor on the warrant of an inferior court unless he is first tried and convicted for such misdemeanor in the inferior court and appeals to the superior court from the sentence pronounced against him by the inferior court on his conviction for such misdemeanor. State v. Guffey, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 94</cite>, 194 S.E.2d 827 (1973).

       </p>
       <p>
        The word "confront"
   
   does not simply secure to the accused the privilege of examining witnesses in his behalf, but is an affirmance of the rule of the common law that in trials by jury the witness must be present before the jury and accused, so that he may be confronted; that is, put face to face. And this, of course, includes the right of cross-examination. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">47 N.C. 66</cite> (1854); State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 74</cite> (1870); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 600</cite>, 107 S.E. 466 (1921); State v. Maynard, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 653</cite>, 113 S.E. 682 (1922); State v. Snipes, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 743</cite>, 117 S.E. 500 (1923); State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 727</cite>, 119 S.E. 170 (1923); State v. Hightower, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 300</cite>, 121 S.E. 616 (1924); State v. Hartsfield, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 357</cite>, 124 S.E. 629 (1924); State v. Breece, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 92</cite>, 173 S.E. 9 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "confront" secures to the accused the right to have his witnesses in court and to examine them in his behalf. It further secures to the accused a fair opportunity to prepare and present his defense, which right must be afforded him not only in form but in substance. State v. Hackney, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 230</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 778 (1954); State v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 550</cite>, 112 S.E.2d 85 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of confrontation is an absolute right
   
   rather than a privilege, and it must be afforded an accused not only in form but in substance. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant is entitled to a full and fair cross-examination upon the subject of the witness' examination-in-chief, and this is an absolute right rather than a privilege. State v. Bumper, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 670</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 457 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to compulsory process is not absolute,
   
   and a state may require that a defendant requesting such process at state expense establish some colorable need for the person to be summoned, lest the right be abused by those who would make frivolous requests. State v. House, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 189</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 654 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Actual Presence Required.
   
   - The essential characteristic of defendant's constitutional right to presence is just that, his actual presence during trial. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the N.C. State Constitution, defendant's actual presence is required throughout his trial, not just at particularly important junctures. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an in-chambers conference occurred between the trial judge and counsel without defendant, defendant's constitutional right to be present at every stage of his capital trial was violated. State v. Meyer, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 619</cite>, 481 S.E.2d 649 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in-chambers discussion, which occurred outside of defendant's presence, was not included in the record, the court did not know the substance of the in-chambers conference held with the attorneys in defendant's absence; consequently, the court was unable to determine whether the error committed was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt and ordered a new sentencing proceeding. State v. Meyer, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 619</cite>, 481 S.E.2d 649 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Certain Violations of Right May Be Harmless.
   
   - Notwithstanding an accused's right to be present, at all stages of trial, certain violations of this right may be harmless if such appears from the record. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bench Conferences Not Violative of Right to Be Present.
   
   - A defendant's state constitutional right to be present at all stages of his capital trial is not violated when, with defendant present in the courtroom, the trial court conducts bench conferences, even though unrecorded, with counsel for both parties. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant's constitutional right to be present at all stages of his capital trial is not violated when the trial court conducts a bench conference among the lawyers in open court where defendant is present in the courtroom. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 586</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 174 (1997), cert. denied, - N.C.
   - , 502 S.E.2d 611 (1998).

       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional right to be present at all stages of his capital trial is not violated when, with defendant present in the courtroom, the trial court conducts bench conferences, even though unrecorded, with counsel for both parties.

        Chambers Conference.
   
   - Although it was error to conduct a chambers conference with counsel for the state and counsel for defendant in the defendants absence, the error did not mandate automatic reversal. State v. Addison, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 741, 496 S.E.2d 412 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        State carried the burden of demonstrating that error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where the court conducted a chambers conference with counsel for the state and counsel for defendant in the defendants absence. State v. Addison, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 741, 496 S.E.2d 412 (1998).

        Bailiff's Communication with Jurors.
   
   - Defendant who was charged with murder and armed robbery was not denied his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the North Carolina Constitution, N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23, because the trial court told the bailiff to remind that jurors that they were not to discuss the case with anyone while the jury was not deliberating, and the bailiff gave that instruction while defendant was not present. State v. Coleman, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 587 S.E.2d 889 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Be Present Not Violated When Jurors Excused During Bench Conferences.
   
   - Defendant's right to be present during all stages of his trial pursuant to this section was not violated when the trial court excused jurors during bench conferences State v. Neal, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 608</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 734 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 1125, 118 S. Ct. 1072, 140 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If, however, the subject matter of the conference implicates the defendant's confrontation rights,
   
   or is such that the defendant's presence would have a reasonably substantial relation to this opportunity to defend, the defendant would have a constitutional right to be present. State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 202</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 832 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's absence during certain conferences and discussions in his capital trial did not prejudice defendant in any way
   
   and was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, where defendant's counsel was present, as was the court reporter, who recorded and transcribed the complete proceedings, the subjects of the conferences and discussions were either points of law, procedural matters, or administrative matters, none of which involved communication with the jury, and no witness gave testimony concerning defendant's guilt. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 1</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 288 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Be Present at Every Stage.
   
   - This section is the sole source of the criminal defendant's nonwaivable state right to be present at every stage of his capital trial and of the corollary duty imposed on the trial court to insure his presence. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The confrontation clause of the Constitution of North Carolina guarantees the right of the defendant to be present at every stage of the trial. This state constitutional protection afforded to the defendant imposes on the trial court the affirmative duty to insure the defendant's presence at every stage of a capital trial. The defendant's right to be present at every stage of the trial ought to be kept forever sacred and inviolate. In fact, the defendant's right to be present at every stage of his capital trial is not waivable. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 65</cite>, 418 S.E.2d 213 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the trial court's failure to disclose the third jury note violated defendant's right to presence, defendant was not prejudiced because had the trial court disclosed the note and defendant had renewed his objection under N.C. R. Evid. 403, the trial court would not have had any reason to change its ruling admitting the inmate's testimony of defendant's confession and threats to potential witnesses. State v. Mackey, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. App.</cite> 586, 774 S.E.2d 382 (2015).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Does Not Apply to Physical Evidence.
   
   - This section only pertains to witnesses, and does not create a constitutional right of confrontation to physical evidence. State v. Alston, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 707, 373 S.E.2d 306 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Includes Opportunity to Face Accusers and Witnesses with Other Testimony.
   
   - Defendants have a constitutional right of confrontation, which cannot lawfully be taken from them, and this includes the right of a fair opportunity to face the accusers and witnesses with other testimony. State v. Garner, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 361</cite>, 166 S.E. 180 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant has the constitutional right, in a criminal prosecution, to confront his accusers with other testimony. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 176 S.E.2d 41 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to face one's accusers and witnesses with other testimony is guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. VI, which is made applicable to the states by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, and by this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972); State v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 644</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 551 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Cross-Examine.
   
   - The right of a defendant to confront his accusers includes the right to cross-examine them on any subject touched on in their examination-in-chief, and a witness testifying to facts incriminating defendant on his examination-in-chief may not deprive defendant of his right to cross-examine him on the ground that answers to questions asked on cross-examination might tend to incriminate the witness. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 796</cite>, 188 S.E. 639 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to confront affirms the common-law rule that in criminal trials by jury the witness must be present and subject to cross-examination under oath. State v. Bumper, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 670</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 457 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party to either a civil or criminal proceeding may elicit from an opposing witness on cross-examination particular facts having a logical tendency to show that the witness is biased against him, hostile to his cause, or interested adversely to him in the outcome of the litigation. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 395</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 445 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most jealously guarded rights in the administration of justice is that of cross-examining an adversary's witnesses. State v. Carey, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 254</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 387 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3209, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1209 (1976); State v. Harrill, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 186</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 325, death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).

   - Nothing in the record showed that defendant was prejudiced by his absence during part of the presentation of the prosecution's evidence in defendant's capital case where all proceedings took place in open court; everything that took place was reflected in the record, and the record showed that defense counsel were in court and participated throughout defendant's absence to protect his interest, the trial judge told counsel they could confer with defendant as to the possibility of his return at any time, and the trial judge undertook to perform his duty to assure defendant's presence. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).

        Right Not Violated When Court Conducted Bench Conferences with Counsel for Both Parties.
   
   - A defendant's state constitutional right to be present at all stages of his capital trial was not violated when the trial court conducted bench conferences with counsel for both parties while the defendant was present in the courtroom. State v. Upchurch, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 439</cite>, 421 S.E.2d 577 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court conducted numerous bench conferences with counsel in which defendant did not participate, nothing in the record indicated that defendant was not present in the courtroom during their discussions, the trial court received no evidence during any of these bench conferences, and most of the discussion concerned mechanical aspects of the proceedings, including lunch breaks, presentation of proposed instruction by the trial court to counsel for their comments, and argument of technical motions or objections out of the jury's hearing; therefore, because defendant was represented by counsel during each of these conferences, nothing in the record demonstrates how defendant's presence would have served any useful purpose, nor does defendant demonstrate how the conferences impinged upon his opportunity to defend and failed to demonstrate any violation of his constitutional protections. State v. Bacon, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 66</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 542 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1159, 115 S. Ct. 1120, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1083 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's unrecorded private communications with three prospective jurors,
   
   perhaps violative of defendant's nonwaivable constitutional right to be present at every stage of his trial, were harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt because the record adequately revealed the substance of those communications and the jurors were properly excused. State v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 483</cite>, 515 S.E.2d 885 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Violated by Court's Private Bench Conferences with Jurors.
   
   - The fact that the jury recommended and the trial court entered a sentence of life imprisonment did not change the capital nature of that trial or his status as a capital defendant in that trial. Therefore, the unwaiveable requirement of his presence applied at every stage of his trial and was violated by the trial court's private bench conferences with prospective jurors. State v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 680</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 228 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury selection is a stage of a capital trial at which the defendant must be present. The trial court erred by conducting bench conferences with prospective jurors out of the hearing of the defendant and his counsel. Therefore, the Supreme Court had to order a new trial. State v. Moss, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 65</cite>, 418 S.E.2d 213 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion of Defendant from In Camera Hearing with Juror.
   
   - Although it is clearly error for the trial court to communicate with a juror in chambers in the absence of defendant, counsel, or a court reporter, not every violation of a constitutional right is prejudicial. Where the record of an in camera hearing attended only by a juror, the trial judge, counsel, and a court reporter reflected the benign substance of the conversation, the juror's growing unease with her ability to impose the death penalty, and where after the hearing the juror was promptly and properly removed for cause, obviating the possibility that anything said to her privately by the trial court might infect the jury as a whole, this action was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Artis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 278</cite>, 384 S.E.2d 470 (1989), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1023, 110 S. Ct. 1466, 108 L. Ed. 2d 604 (1990), in light of Calvert v. Peebles, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 334</cite> (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error for the trial court to exclude the defendants, their counsel, and the court reporter from its private conversations with prospective jurors prior to excusing those jurors. State v. Johnston, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 680</cite>, 417 S.E.2d 228 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it is error for the trial court to conduct a chambers conference with counsel for the state and counsel for defendant in defendant's absence, where defendant was present during the questioning of a juror and was fully apprised of the facts underlying the reasons for the juror's excusal, defendant had full opportunity to be heard and to lodge any objection he might have. State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 243</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 298 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1135, 115 S. Ct. 953, 130 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1995).

        Judge's Ex Parte Communications with Jury Before Verdict Rendered.
   
   - Where, during the course of the trial, the presiding trial judge engaged in an ex parte communication with the jury, and prior to reconvening court, the judge entered the jury room where the jurors had gathered and was alone with the jurors, this conduct on the part of the presiding judge violated the defendant's rights under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   23 and this section, and U.S. Const., Amends. VI and XIV. State v. Callahan, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 344, 401 S.E.2d 793 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming arguendo that judge's chance meeting in the corridor with jurors during a recess at which time judge and jurors discussed, inter alia, cameras in the courtroom and selection of a foreman, did constitute a "stage" of a capital proceeding, the error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where there existed in the record a reconstruction of the ex parte conversations. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">331 N.C. 122</cite>, 415 S.E.2d 732 (1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1055, 113 S. Ct. 983, 122 L. Ed. 2d 136, rehearing denied, 507 U.S. 967, 113 S. Ct. 1404, 122 L. Ed. 2d 776 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the court found two prospective jurors were ineligible to serve due to their recent service as prospective jurors, and third prospective juror, who had arranged to be a pallbearer at a funeral, was deferred for a "manifestly unobjectionable" reason, the error of the judge in communicating ex parte with the prospective jurors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 401</cite>, 439 S.E.2d 760 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ex parte "communication" between judge and jury,
   
   wherein the trial judge routinely inquired about any problems individual jurors might have that he needed to know about, did not violate defendant's state and federal constitutional rights to be present during the proceedings against him, where the trial judge's statement indicated that no such problems were either expressed by the jurors or discussed with them by the trial judge. State v. Laws, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 81</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 609 (1989), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1465, 108 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was a sufficient record of the substance of ex parte communications between the judge and both prosecutor and defense counsel and defendant had opportunity to challenge the ruling in open court when it was announced in his presence, defendant was not prejudiced by the communications. State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 243</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 298 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1135, 115 S. Ct. 953, 130 L. Ed. 2d 895 (1995).

       <p>
        Private Discussion Between Judge and Jurors who had been Dismissed.
   
   - Defendant's State and federal constitutional rights to be present at all stages of his trial were not violated when the trial court talked privately with jurors, since the transcript showed that the trial judge sent all those who still were prospective jurors home and indicated that he was going to talk only to those whom he had dismissed from jury service. State v. Laws, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 81</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 609 (1989), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1465, 108 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        No violation of defendant's constitutional right to be present at every stage of his trial, pursuant to this section, occurred on account of the trial court's alleged ex parte communication with, and the excusing of, a juror. The trial court's memorialization of the private communication between the prospective juror, the clerk and the trial court, which was neither questioned nor objected to by defendant or his counsel, disclosed that the prospective juror was excused for a valid reason and that the communication was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Holder, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 530 S.E.2d 562 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bailiff's Communication with Prospective Jurors.
   
   - Where the bailiff was ordered to engage in unrecorded communications with prospective jurors and the trial jury, the actions of the clerk involved the clerk's administrative duties of calling the jury roll and explaining to the jurors what time they needed to arrive at court and did not relate to the consideration of defendant's guilt or innocence; therefore, no constitutional violation occurred. State v. Bacon, <cite class="nc_code">337 N.C. 66</cite>, 446 S.E.2d 542 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1159, 115 S. Ct. 1120, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1083 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of cross-examination rests in the discretion of the trial judge,
   
   and his rulings thereon will not be disturbed absent a showing of abuse of discretion. State v. Royal, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 515</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 517 (1980); State v. Moses, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 279 S.E.2d 59, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 318</cite>, 281 S.E.2d 390 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial Judge May Limit Cross-Examination for Purposes of Impeachment.
   
   - When cross-examination is made for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a witness, the method and duration of the cross-examination for these purposes rest largely in the discretion of the trial court, and the trial court may properly exclude such cross-examination when it becomes merely repetitious or argumentative. State v. Bumper, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 670</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 457 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To convict the defendant under the theory of aiding and abetting,
   
   the State has the burden of proving, among other things, that the crimes alleged have in fact been committed. Although it is not required that the principal be convicted, the guilt of the principal must be established beyond a reasonable doubt. This burden cannot be carried by testimony concerning judgments rendered in other trials to which the defendant was not a party and not able to cross-examine witnesses. The admission of such evidence violates defendant's right to confrontation under the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of North Carolina. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 361</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 225 (1987), overruling State v. Duncan, <cite class="nc_code">28 N.C. 98</cite> (1846) and State v. Chittem, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. 49</cite> (1830).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Undue Repetition, Argumentativeness and Peripheral Inquiry Should Be Banned.
   
   - While it is axiomatic that the cross-examiner ought to be allowed wide latitude, the trial judge has the responsibility to exercise his discretion in such a way that unduly repetitive and argumentative questioning, as well as inquiry into matters which are only peripherally relevant, are banned. State v. Royal, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 515</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 517 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Prepare and Present Defense Guaranteed.
   
   - The constitutional right of a defendant in a criminal prosecution to confront his accusers and adverse witnesses with other testimony, as provided by this section, includes the right to a fair opportunity to prepare and present his defenses, which right must be accorded him not only in form, but in substance as well. State v. Whitfield, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 696</cite>, 175 S.E. 93, cert. denied, 293 U.S. 556, 55 S. Ct. 114, 79 L. Ed. 658 (1934); State v. Utley, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 39</cite>, 25 S.E.2d 195 (1943); State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 497</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 520 (1949), discussed in 27 N.C.L. Rev. 544 (1949); State v. Speller, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 345</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 294 (1949); State v. Whisnant, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 736</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 545 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of confrontation carries with it not only the right to face one's accusers and witnesses with other testimony, but also the opportunity fairly to present one's defense. State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 349</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 389 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Due process requires that every defendant be allowed a reasonable time and opportunity to investigate and produce competent evidence, if he can, in defense of the crime with which he stands charged and to confront his accusers with other testimony. State v. Baldwin, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 690</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 526 (1970); State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 105</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 426 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Every defendant is entitled under the Constitution to have a reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense. This includes the right to consult with his counsel and to have a fair and reasonable opportunity, in the light of all attendant circumstances, to investigate, to prepare, as well as to present his defense. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 176 S.E.2d 41 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is implicit in the guarantees of assistance of counsel and confrontation of one's accusers and witnesses that an accused have a reasonable time to investigate, prepare and present his defense. However, no set length of time for investigation, preparation and presentation is required, and whether defendant is denied due process must be determined upon the basis of the circumstances of each case. State v. Vick, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 37</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 335, cert. dismissed, 423 U.S. 918, 96 S. Ct. 228, 46 L. Ed. 2d 367 (1975); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 681</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 437 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of a defendant charged with a criminal offense to present to the jury his version of the facts is a fundamental element of due process of law, guaranteed by the federal and state constitutions. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 118</cite>, 505 S.E.2d 277 (1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1075, 119 S. Ct. 1475, 143 L. Ed. 2d 559 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Right Not Denied by Refusing Continuance.
   
   - The denial of a continuance is not prejudicial error where the record fails to show that it would have enabled defendant and his counsel to obtain additional evidence or otherwise present a stronger defense. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 497</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 520 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying the defendant's motions for a continuance before trial and during trial as the defendant failed to prove he would acquire proof of his innocence because of the continuance. State v. Marecek, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. App.</cite> 479, 568 S.E.2d 237 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a continuance did not deprive him of his constitutional rights because defendant was on notice that the victim's wife was a witness he would wish to consult with about his case; defendant's motion for a continuance was not supported by an affidavit and did not describe with any particularity what the wife's testimony would be beyond "exculpatory statements" that would "impeach her own husband and would impeach his credibility." State v. McMillian, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Apr. 20, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        When Motion for Continuance Presents Question of Law.
   
   - When a motion for a continuance in a criminal case is based on a right guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, the question presented is one of law and not of discretion, and the decision of the court below is reviewable. State v. Farrell, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 321</cite>, 26 S.E.2d 322 (1943); State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. 349</cite>, 128 S.E.2d 389 (1962); State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">7 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 172 S.E.2d 249 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motion for continuance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and his ruling thereon is not subject to review on appeal, except in a case of manifest abuse; however, when the motion is based on a right guaranteed by the federal and State Constitutions, the question presented is one of law and the order of the court is reviewable. State v. Phillip, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 263</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 386, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 1003, 84 S. Ct. 1939, 12 L. Ed. 2d 1052, rehearing denied, 379 U.S. 874, 85 S. Ct. 28, 13 L. Ed. 2d 83 (1964); State v. Brower, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 644</cite>, 224 S.E.2d 551 (1976); State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 681</cite>, 228 S.E.2d 437 (1976); State v. Beeson, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 602</cite>, 234 S.E.2d 595 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a motion for continuance is ordinarily addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial court's ruling is not subject to review absent abuse of discretion, if the motion is based on the constitutional right of confrontation, in that the refusal of the motion denied defendant a reasonable time within which to prepare and present his defense, the decision of the trial court is reviewable as a question of law. State v. Abernathy, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 147</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 373 (1978); State v. Parton, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 55</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 410 (1981), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 432</cite>, 333 S.E.2d 743 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Presence of Witnesses Required.
   
   - The right of confrontation confirms the common-law rule that, in criminal trials, the witnesses must be present and subject to cross-examination. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Not in All Cases.
   
   - The right guaranteed by this section does not mean that never under any circumstances shall a criminal charge be prosecuted except by the presence of living witnesses. State v. Dowdy, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 432</cite>, 58 S.E. 1002 (1907).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A good faith effort to obtain witness's presence must be shown to justify use of his prior testimony.

        Where Child Is Victim.
   
   - When considering admission of a child victim's statement to a social worker when the child is found to be incompetent as a witness, the confrontation clause and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rule 803(24) require a case-by-case examination of the facts. State v. Deanes, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 508</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 249 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1101, 109 S. Ct. 2455, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction of Transcribed Testimony.
   
   - The constitutional right of confrontation is not denied an accused by the introduction at a subsequent trial of the transcribed testimony given at a former trial of the same action by a witness who has since died, become insane, left the State permanently or for an indefinite absence, become incapacitated to testify in court as a result of a permanent or indefinite illness, or absented himself by procurement of, or connivance with, the accused. The accuracy of the transcription must be attested and it must appear that the defendant had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the witness. State v. Prince, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 769</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 897 (1967); State v. Biggerstaff, <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 191 S.E.2d 426 (1972).

   - While this section gives to the accused the right to confront his accusers, such does not apply when the facts, from their very nature, can only be proved by a duly authenticated copy of a record. State v. Dowdy, <cite class="nc_code">145 N.C. 432</cite>, 58 S.E. 1002 (1907).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statements falling within an exception to the general prohibition against hearsay
   
   may be admitted into evidence without violating a defendant's right to confrontation, if the evidence is reliable. State v. Stager, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 278</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 876 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where hearsay proffered by the prosecution comes within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, this constitutional provision was not violated, even though no particularized showing was made as to the necessity for using such hearsay or as to its reliability or trustworthiness. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 644</cite>, 503 S.E.2d 101 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Hearsay in Criminal Trial.
   
   - A prosecutor is prohibited by U.S. Const., Amend. VI and this section from introducing any hearsay evidence in a criminal trial unless two requirements are met. The prosecution must show both the necessity for using the hearsay testimony and the inherent trustworthiness of the original declaration. State v. Gregory, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 565, 338 S.E.2d 110 (1985), cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 382</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 901 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Hearsay in Sentencing Proceedings.
   
   - Trial court did not err in admitting hearsay evidence of an alleged bribe offered to the witness by defendant at defendant's sentencing; further, the use of this hearsay evidence did not violate the Confrontation Clause. State v. Sings, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 162, 641 S.E.2d 370, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 574</cite>, 2007 N.C. LEXIS 885 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a two-prong constitutional test for the admission of hearsay under the confrontation clause,
   
   i.e., necessity and trustworthiness. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 484 S.E.2d 405 (1997), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 644</cite>, 503 S.E.2d 101 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecution in a criminal trial must, as prerequisite to the introduction of hearsay evidence, show the necessity for using the hearsay testimony and establish the inherent trustworthiness of the original declaration. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 129, 484 S.E.2d 405 (1997), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 644</cite>, 503 S.E.2d 101 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In-Court Identification.
   
   - Where the evidence shows that witness had a good and sufficient opportunity to observe a defendant at the time the offense was being committed, and testifies that his in-court identification is based on his observation made at that time, the test of "clear and convincing evidence" is met. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 210 S.E.2d 876, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 470</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 123 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there is objection to an in-court identification by a witness who participated in an illegal lineup procedure, such evidence must be excluded unless it be determined on voir dire that the in-court identification is of independent origin and therefore not tainted by the illegal lineup. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Out-of-Court Declarations of Codefendant.
   
   - Even when the right of confrontation is afforded to a defendant implicated in the out-of-court declarations of a codefendant, the prejudicial impact of testimony of the codefendant's declarations must be evaluated in the light of the competent evidence admitted against the nondeclarant defendant. The gap between the impact of evidence which is not admitted against but incriminates the nondeclarant and of competent evidence of minimal probative value admitted against him in a given case may be so great as to constitute a denial of due process. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 322</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 858 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of Codefendant's Confession Inculpating Accused.
   
   - An accused's constitutional right of cross-examination is violated at his joint trial with a codefendant who does not testify, when the court admits the codefendant's confession inculpating the accused, notwithstanding jury instructions that the confession must be disregarded in determining the accused's guilt or innocence. State v. Heard, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 167</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 826 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        In joint trials of defendants it is necessary to exclude extrajudicial confessions unless all portions which implicate defendants other than the declarant can be deleted without prejudice either to the State or declarant, and if such deletion is not possible, the State must choose between relinquishing the confession or trying the defendants separately, assuming (1) that the confession is inadmissible as to the codefendant, and (2) that the declarant will not take the stand. State v. Heard, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 167</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 826 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The improper admission of evidence
   
   which violates the right of confrontation does not constitute prejudicial error unless there is a reasonable possibility that such evidence contributed to defendant's conviction. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecution's privilege to withhold the identity of an informant
   
   is founded upon public interest in effective law enforcement and its application turns on the facts of each particular case. State v. Ketchie, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 387</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 207 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Rights of Person Accused of Offense involving Intoxication.
   
   - When a person is taken into police custody for an offense of which intoxication is an essential element, time is of the essence, as intoxication does not last. Thus, if one accused of driving while intoxicated is to have witnesses for his defense, he must have access to his counsel, friends, relatives, or some disinterested person within a relatively short time after his arrest. The statute says he is entitled to communicate with them immediately, and this is true whether he is arrested at 2:00 A.M. or 2:00 P.M. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate correctly imposed pretrial release restriction requiring a sober responsible adult to take custody of the defendant pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Va26s15A-534.2" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-534.2</a></cite>; there was no constitutional violation of defendant's constitutional right to obtain evidence on his own behalf. State v. Bumgarner, <cite class="nc_code">97 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 389 S.E.2d 425, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 599</cite>, 393 S.E.2d 873 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A criminal defendant is entitled to offer evidence in defense at trial,
   
   either through her own testimony or through the testimony of other witnesses. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 403</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 234, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Court May Not Forbid Defendant to Offer Detrimental Evidence.
   
   - The trial court is not authorized to forbid a defendant appearing in propria persona to offer evidence, otherwise competent, for the reason that, in the judgment of the court, however sound, such evidence would be detrimental to the defendant. The defendant, whether represented by counsel or appearing in propria persona, is entitled to use his own judgment as to the wisdom of introducing otherwise competent evidence. To deny him this right is to deny him his constitutional rights afforded both by U.S. Const., Amend. VI and this section. State v. House, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 189</cite>, 244 S.E.2d 654 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of Showing Denial of Right.
   
   - Appellant has the burden of showing not only error but also prejudicial error on appeal of trial judge's refusal to allow cross-examination of a witness. State v. Harrill, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 186</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 325, death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden is on defendant to show a clear denial of the right of confrontation. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">51 N.C. App.</cite> 613, 277 S.E.2d 546 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Right.
   
   - The accused has the right to insist upon the production of his accusers, but this is a right which may be and is waived by failure to assert it in proper time. The right must be insisted upon in express terms and a general objection to the evidence is not sufficient. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 784</cite>, 25 S.E. 783 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant may waive the general right to be present at his trial by his voluntary and unexplained absence from court. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 242, 650 S.E.2d 612, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 89</cite>, 656 S.E.2d 280 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of Confrontation Is Applicable to Contempt Proceedings.
   
   - The right of confrontation of the witnesses against an accused is applicable to contempt proceedings; thus, an adjudication of contempt against defendant based on the affidavit of the receiver of a corporation was invalid. Lowder v. All Star Mills, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 561</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 247 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of Confrontation Does Not Apply to Civil Actions.
   
   - The right accorded defendant in a criminal prosecution to confront the witnesses against him does not apply to civil actions. Chesson v. Kieckhefer Container Co., <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 378</cite>, 26 S.E.2d 904 (1943).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proper standard for reversal in reviewing violations under this section of defendant's right to be present at all stages
   
   of his capital trial is the rigorous standard prescribed for review of violations of defendant's right to be present at trial under the federal Constitution. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The proper standard for reversal in reviewing violations of defendant's state constitutional right to be present at his capital trial is the "harmless beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, and not the standard apparently prescribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1443ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1443(a)</a></cite>. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Rights.
   
   - For a case in which a defendant was held to have waived his rights under this section through his insufficiently explained absence from trial, see State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 174</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 61 (1991).

        Admission of Business Records Did Not Violate Defendant's Right of Confrontation.
   
   - State investigative reports that gave the results of DNA tests incriminating defendant were properly admitted at his trial for murder and rape under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 803(8), as public records, even though the investigator who made the records did not testify. His supervisor testified, the reports concerned routine matters and recorded only ministerial observations, and defendant's right of confrontation was not violated. State v. Forte, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 427</cite>, 629 S.E.2d 137 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of nonhearsay raises no Confrontation Clause concerns;
   
   testimony regarding an officer's interaction with a detective and a third individual was non-hearsay, and raised no Confrontation Clause concerns, since it was not admitted to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather to show how the officer formed a reasonable suspicion that defendant was involved in the robbery at issue, which in turn justified including defendant's photo in a lineup shown to the robbery victim. State v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 628 S.E.2d 434 (2006), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 358</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 357 (2007).

       <p>
        DNA Tests Incriminating Defendant Properly Admitted.
   
   - State investigative reports that gave the results of DNA tests incriminating defendant were properly admitted at his trial for murder and rape as business records under G.S. 8C-1-803(6), even though the investigator who made the reports did not testify. His supervisor testified, and the reports were not testimonial but were neutral and were not prepared exclusively for trial, and defendant's right of confrontation was not violated. State v. Forte, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 427</cite>, 629 S.E.2d 137 (2006).

        Depositions taken in the absence of a defendant
   
   could not be read against him. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. 103</cite> (1794).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The taking of depositions in another state in the absence of the defendant
   
   was assumed by the court to be a "stage" of his capital trial. However, it was clear that all of the testimony of the witnesses during the taking of those depositions tended to support mitigating circumstances. The admission of those depositions into evidence during the capital sentencing proceeding, therefore, could not possibly have harmed the defendant. Accordingly, the State bore its burden of showing that any error as a result was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. McCollum, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 208</cite>, 433 S.E.2d 144 (1993), cert. denied, 512 U.S. 1254, 114 S. Ct. 2784, 129 L. Ed. 2d 895, reh'g denied, 512 U.S. 1278, 115 S. Ct. 26, 129 L.

       <p>
        Improper Materials Published to Jury.
   
   - The defendant's confrontation rights were violated in his murder prosecution, where the prosecutor's notes of an interview with an alleged accomplice as well as a typewritten list of statements attributed to the defendants by an accomplice were inadvertently included among exhibits published to the jury, and neither of the documents had been admitted into evidence and both contained inadmissible material. State v. Hines, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 457, 508 S.E.2d 310 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>

        Business Records.
   
   - Entries in the course of business, made upon the books of a railroad company by one who was at the time an agent of the company, and was still living, but was absent from the State, were held not competent evidence of the facts therein set forth upon the trial of a third person for crime. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 74</cite> (1870).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Voir Dire.
   
   - The questioning of jurors in defendant's absence erroneously deprived defendant of his right to be present at his trial, but the error was harmless where the court was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's absence during the preliminary questioning of prospective jurors did not result in the rejection of any juror whom defendant was entitled to have on the panel or the seating of any juror whom defendant was entitled to reject either for cause or peremptorily. State v. Payne, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 377</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 582 (1991).

       </p>
       <p>
        A capital murder defendant's constitutional right to be present at every stage of the proceedings was not violated by holding 10 bench conferences outside his presence, where the defendant was present in the courtroom and represented by counsel at each conference, and the only unrecorded conference occurred during voir dire of a prospective juror who was excused for cause because her views would prevent or substantially impair her performance as juror. State v. Bonnett, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 417</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 563 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1124, 119 S. Ct. 909, 142 L. Ed. 2d 907 (1999).

       <p>
        No Right to Be Present at Pre-Trial Venue and Venire Negotiations.
   
   - The defendants' federal and state constitutional rights to be present at every stage of their capital trial were not violated when the court ordered the jury drawn from a special venire; although they were not present during out-of-court meetings relating to change of venue or a special venire which took place prior to commencement of defendants' trial, they were present at the hearing on change of venue; furthermore, when the trial court proposed a special venire, both defendants agreed, through counsel. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>, 533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 931, 121 S. Ct. 1379, 1380, 149 L.

        Private Discussions with Prospective Jurors.
   
   - In capital case, trial court's error in having unrecorded private discussions with prospective jurors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as the record did not indicate that any action was taken by the trial judge as a result of these discussions. State v. Scott, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 564 S.E.2d 285 (2002), appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 443</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 508 (2002).

        Trial court's action in excusing prospective jurors as a result of its private unrecorded bench conferences

       <p>
        Ex Parte Communication with and Dismissal of Jurors Held Harmless.
   
   - The court's dismissal of six prospective jurors after unrecorded, private bench discussions was harmless where the preliminary questioning of prospective jurors did not result in the rejection of any juror whom defendant was entitled to have on the panel or the seating of any juror whom defendant was entitled to reject either for cause or peremptorily. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 281</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 849 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Clerk of Court's Communication with Jurors.
   
   - The trial court's direction to the clerk of court to meet privately with jurors about transportation and other logistical matters did not violate the defendants' constitutional rights, although the court omitted a warning to some of the jurors that "no one can answer or would answer any questions about any other aspect of the trial"; absent proof to the contrary, the appellate court assumed that the clerk did not discuss bus routes or travel time or other information which might relate to the crime but limited any discussion to logistics and administrative matters. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>, 533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 931, 121 S. Ct. 1379, 1380, 149 L.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Handling and Disclosure of Jury Notes.
   
   - The trial court did not violate defendant's federal or state constitutional rights to presence and effective assistance of counsel by refusing to disclose the full content of notes from the jury, failing to let counsel see or read the notes, or responding without eliciting and considering the informed positions of defendant and his counsel where the court substantially disclosed the content, heard from counsel and responded in open court to each of the communications. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 1</cite>, 539 S.E.2d 243 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 839, 122 S. Ct. 95, 151 L. Ed. 2d 55 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Absence of Material Witness.
   
   - Defendants' right to confrontation was not denied by refusal of a motion to continue, on the ground of the absence of a material, expert, fingerprint witness, where the prosecuting attorney agreed that he would not offer evidence as to fingerprints. State v. Rising, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 747</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 221 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not violate this section by denying a capital murder defendant's motions for a recess or continuance and for a mistrial after an eyewitness could not be located; defendant had the benefit of witness' tape-recorded statements to both the Sheriff's Department and his own counsel, and the evidence indicated the witness had gone into hiding for a long period under circumstances indicating no likelihood of locating him within a reasonable period of time. State v. Roper, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 337</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 600, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 902, 112 S. Ct. 280, 116 L. Ed. 2d 232 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to present witnesses to confront the evidence against him because his counsel's unsworn statement in support of a continuance, regarding the testimony of a witness whose location had just been discovered the day before, failed to provide detailed proof of a reason for delay and actually supported the State's case. State v. Cody, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. App.</cite> 722, 522 S.E.2d 777 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred by allowing a witness's deposition testimony to be entered into evidence in lieu of her live testimony due to her military deployment in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804, U.S. Const. amend. VI, and this article because the trial court failed to make the required findings of fact to demonstrate unavailability for the purposes of Rule 804 or the Confrontation Clause, the State failed in its burden of showing that the witness could not be made present at trial by process or other reasonable means, and the State failed in its burden of proving it had carried its constitutionally required burden of demonstrating that it had made a good-faith effort to obtain the witness' presence at trial. State v. Clonts, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 95, 802 S.E.2d 531 (2017), aff'd, review improvidently allowed, in part, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 191</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 796, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 426 (2018).

        Inability of Codefendants to Communicate.
   
   - Findings in post-conviction proceedings that petitioners, although jointly tried, were not allowed to communicate with one another prior to trial, and that their attempts to contact witnesses and friends were unsuccessful, did not support the lower court's conclusion of law that petitioners had not been denied any rights guaranteed to them by this section and N.C.

       <p>
        Analysis of Evidence by Expert.
   
   - In defendant's trial on a charge of first degree murder, the trial court erred by denying defendant's motion for a continuance so she could find an expert to analyze the State's expert's conclusion that there was blood splatter on defendant's clothes which suggested that defendant was present when a victim was struck, and the appellate court ordered a new trial because the State did not carry its burden of showing that the trial court's ruling was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Barlowe, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 249, 578 S.E.2d 660 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of the results of laboratory tests performed by a non-testifying witness did not violate defendant's right to confrontation, under U.S. Const., Amends. VI and XIV or N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 because defendant was able to cross-examine a witness qualified as an expert who relied on the test results in giving an expert opinion. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 102, 654 S.E.2d 814, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 371</cite>, 662 S.E.2d 391 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motions to strike the death penalty and to suppress ballistics evidence. Because the State's failure to preserve potentially useful evidence from a crime scene was negligent at worst and there was no suggestion of bad faith, defendant's due process rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§

   19 and 23 were not violated. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 514</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 239 (2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 851, 130 S. Ct. 129, 175 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court abused its discretion in excluding defendant's expert from testifying about tampering on defendant's computer, as the expert was experienced with the subject matter and was in a better position to have an opinion on the subject than was the trier of fact. State v. Cooper, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. App.</cite> 442, 747 S.E.2d 398 (2013), dismissed,

       <p>
        Inspection of Files of State Bureau of Investigation.
   
   - Where there was no contention that anything in the files of the State Bureau of Investigation was admitted in evidence and the record showed that no member of the Bureau testified during the trial, defendants' contention that they were entitled to an inspection of the files of the Bureau in regard to its investigation of the case was untenable, and denial of their petition for such inspection did not violate any of their rights under this section or under U.S. Const., Amends. V, VI, VII and XIV. State v. Goldberg, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 181</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 334, cert. denied, 377 U.S. 978, 84 S. Ct. 1884, 12 L. Ed. 2d 747 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        State's Failure to Turn Over Ballistics Testing.
   
   - Defendant's right to confrontation was violated when the trial court, after ordering the State to turn over test-fired bullets and underlying data examinations for a defense ballistics examination, upon the State's revelation that it had lost the original shells, refused to require the State to retest the weapon in question and allowed the State's ballistics expert to testify. State v. Canady, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 242</cite>, 559 S.E.2d 762 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Withdrawal of Witness Before Cross-Examination.
   
   - Where, during the testimony of a witness, the prosecution asks for and receives permission to withdraw the witness to be recalled later, but closes its case without recalling the witness, defendant, if he wishes to assert his right to cross-examine the witness, must request the court to have the witness return to the stand, and when he fails to do so, he may not assert that he was deprived of his constitutional right of confrontation. State v. Gattison, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 669</cite>, 146 S.E.2d 825 (1966), overruled on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 276</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 133 (1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        Use of Closed-Circuit Television in Courtroom Held Adequate to Allow Defendant to Cross-Examine Child Victim.
   
   - Where, in prosecution for taking indecent liberties with a four-year-old child, during voir dire hearing as to victim's competency as a witness, defendant, although absent from the courtroom, was able to hear all testimony, interact freely with his attorney, and through his attorney confront the victim, thereby accomplishing effective cross-examination, the exclusion of defendant did not violate N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   18, 19 or 23, as the trial court's use of a closed-circuit television and its act of providing defendant and his attorney adequate opportunity to communicate during the victim's testimony were sufficient to permit defendant to hear the evidence and to refute it. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 584, 367 S.E.2d 139 (1988).
       </p>

        Trial court did not err, pursuant to G.S.
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   15A-1225.1, in its decision to permit a juvenile witness to testify against defendant in the presence of the jury and attorneys, while making defendant go to another room where defendant could watch the proceedings in real time on closed circuit television because defendant's constitutional right to confrontation was not violated as there was a phone in the room so that defendant could cause a signal to flash on the phone on defense counsel's table to indicate that defendant wished to speak with the attorney and defendant's trial counsel had a full opportunity to cross-examine the witness when the witness was on the stand. Furthermore, the testimony of a licensed clinical social worker and psychotherapist, who had years of training and experience in providing therapy to young victims of trauma, supported the trial court's findings of fact and those findings of fact, in turn, supported the trial court's conclusions of law. State v. Lanford, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 189, 736 S.E.2d 619 (2013).

       <p>
        State Fulfilled Confrontation Clause Requirement by Showing Good Faith Attempt.
   
   - Where a four-year-old child was unable to answer question put to her regarding sexual abuse due to fear, the judge's declaration that the child "is simply going to be unable to testify," amounted to an implicit declaration of unavailability; the State fulfilled the constitutional requirement of the confrontation clause by showing a good faith attempt to secure the witness for trial since the State produced the witness and attempted to elicit her testimony. State v. Chandler, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 172</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 728 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        State Violated Confrontation Clause Requirement Where Good Faith Efforts Were Not Shown.
   
   - In a capital murder case, defendant's confrontation rights were violated where there was insufficient evidence to support a conclusion that the State employed good-faith efforts to contact and produce a witness at sentencing. State v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 433</cite>, 584 S.E.2d 765 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of Prior Testimony.
   
   - Where a trial was terminated prior to verdict at the instance of defendant in order to obtain other counsel, the testimony of a witness at such trial, with full cross-examination taken in open court and properly attested, was properly admitted in evidence at the subsequent trial when it appeared that the witness was then on military duty outside the boundaries of the United States, and the admission of such testimony did not violate defendant's right of confrontation. State v. Prince, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 769</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 897 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        The admission of co-conspirator/brother's prior trial testimony did not violate the defendant's state or federal constitutional rights to confrontation and cross-examination; where the testimony was trustworthy and more probative than any other evidence which the State could produce through reasonable efforts. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 537 S.E.2d 518 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of Hearsay Evidence Pursuant to an Exception for an Unavailable Declarant.
   
   - Appellate court erred in finding that defendant's right to confrontation pursuant to N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 was violated by allowing an officer to testify pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), that the deceased victim picked defendant from a lineup; although the hearsay statement was testimonial, and thus implicated the confrontation clause, the error was harmless pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1443ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1443(b)</a></cite>, as the outcome of the trial probably would have been the same if the lineup was excluded. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 1</cite>, 619 S.E.2d 830 (2005), vacated, remanded, Lewis v. North Carolina, 126 S. Ct. 2983, 165 L.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's admission of the victim's testimony from a domestic violence protective order hearing
   
   did not violate his right to confront the witness against him as guaranteed by both the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and this section, nor did it violate <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rules 803(3), 404(b), and 403 of the North Carolina Rules of Evidence, where the hearsay statements constituted, and were admissible as, statements of the declarant's then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition and where their probative value outweighed their prejudicial effect. State v. Thibodeaux, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 570</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 797 (2000), cert denied, 531 U.S. 1155, 121 S. Ct. 1106, 148 L. Ed. 2d 976 (2001).

       <p>
        Record Showing Guilty Plea by Codefendant.
   
   - In a prosecution for aiding and abetting, admission of record showing that codefendants had pleaded guilty to the offense deprived defendant of her right of confrontation. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 773</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 236 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant changed his plea
   
   from guilty to not guilty and requested the court to allow him time to obtain witnesses from other states, it was error for the court to force him to trial on the succeeding day, since, under the facts of the case, defendant was not given time to prepare for trial. State v. Whisnant, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 736</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 545 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Deprivation of Right to Call for Evidence.
   
   - Where the effect of failure of the arresting officer and of the custodian of the arrested person to perform their respective duties was such as to deprive the person of the constitutional right to call for evidence in his favor, his subsequent conviction lacked the required due process of law and could not stand. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Extrajudicial statements made by defendants which implicated a codefendant

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Death Certificate.
   
   - Defendant's right to confrontation and his right to fundamental fairness in a criminal trial guaranteed by due process were violated by the admission in evidence of the hearsay and conclusory statement in the victim's death certificate. State v. Watson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 221</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 289, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1043, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 493 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disclosure of Informant.
   
   - Disclosure of informant whose information led the police to defendant would not be relevant or helpful to defendant where there was ample independent evidence of his guilt. State v. McDougald, <cite class="nc_code">18 N.C. App.</cite> 407, 197 S.E.2d 11, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 756</cite>, 198 S.E.2d 726 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant did not contend that informant participated in or witnessed alleged crime, he had no constitutional right to discover the name of the informant. State v. Ketchie, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 387</cite>, 211 S.E.2d 207 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inspection of Witness' Statement.
   
   - Defendants' constitutionally protected rights of confrontation, due process, and equal protection were violated by the denial of their request to inspect what they contended was a written pretrial out-of-court statement by the State's witness. State v. Chavis, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 148, 210 S.E.2d 555 (1974), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 434 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1080, 96 S. Ct. 868, 47 L. Ed. 2d 91 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Search Warrant and Affidavit.
   
   - It is error to allow a search warrant together with the affidavit to obtain the search warrant to be introduced into evidence, because the statements and allegations contained in the affidavit are hearsay statements which deprive the accused of his rights of confrontation and cross-examination. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 394, 210 S.E.2d 876, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 470</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 123 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of Evidence Held Proper.
   
   - In defendant's trial on charges of first degree murder, first degree burglary, second degree kidnapping, and robbery with a dangerous weapon, the trial court properly admitted the videotaped statement defendant's wife gave to police, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(5), after defendant's wife refused to testify for the State at defendant's trial, properly admitted letters one of defendant's co-conspirators wrote to a girlfriend urging the girlfriend to lie about the girlfriend's involvement in the co-conspirator's attempt to conceal evidence of the crime, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C. R. Evid. 804(b)(3), (b)(5), and properly admitted evidence of similar crimes defendant committed shortly after the murder, pursuant to G.S. 8C-1, N.C. R. Evid. 404(b). State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 446, 577 S.E.2d 640 (2003), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 547</cite>, - S.E.2d - (2004), cert. denied, 543 U.S. 1058, 125 S.

       </p>
       <p>
        Court of Appeals erred by failing to find that any error that the trial court might have committed by admitting the challenged portion of the officer's testimony, regarding the victim's statements that defendant had kept the victim in her apartment for about two hours and engaged in a physical struggle with her, was non-prejudicial, as the victim's statements provided the officer with information which led him to ensure defendant was no longer in the apartment and a threat to the victim.

   - Even though it was error to admit the State's physician's deposition testimony at defendant's murder trial even though the defendant took advantage of his right to cross examine the physician at the deposition, because the defendant did not have the right to confront him at trial; the error was harmless error in view of the overwhelming testimonial and other evidence that the victim died and of the defendant's guilt. State v. Ash, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 611 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 66</cite>, 621 S.E.2d 878 (2005).

   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23, a trial court's confrontation clause analysis of a statement should proceed as follows: the initial determination is whether the statement is testimonial or nontestimonial, and if the statement is testimonial, the trial court must then ask whether the declarant is available or unavailable to testify during the trial; if the declarant is unavailable pursuant to the <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, N.C.

   so prejudiced his defense as to amount to a denial of due process and his right to confrontation where defendant was precluded under the circumstances of the joint trial from introducing evidence of codefendant's out-of-court statement, which would have strengthened defendant's alibi defense. State v. Alford, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 372</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 222, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 46, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        New Trial Required Where In-Chambers Conference Held in Defendant's Absence.
   
   - Because in-chambers conference that took place with the attorneys in defendant's absence at conclusion of testimony by forensic psychiatry expert was not recorded, and the nature and content of the private discussion could not be gleaned from the record, the State failed to meet its burden of showing that holding in-chambers discussion in defendant's absence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, and a new trial was ordered. State v. Exum, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 291</cite>, 470 S.E.2d 333 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Plain Error Review.
   
   - Defendant's claim that he was deprived of his constitutional rights under the Confrontation Clause by the admission of out-of-court statements was waived under N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1) because defendant lodged only a general objection but did not object on constitutional grounds and did not assert on appeal plain error, as permitted under Rule 10(c); thus, plain error review was waived, and defendant's constitutional argument was not properly before the court on appeal. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 287, 639 S.E.2d 78, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 364</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 555 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Error in Quashing Subpoena Where Defendant Never Showed Necessity for Compliance.
   
   - In an armed robbery prosecution, the trial court did not err in allowing the state's motion to quash the defendant's subpoena for "all the sawed-off shotguns confiscated by the Greensboro Police Department" since the date of the robbery, since defendant never stated why compliance with the subpoena was necessary to his defense, and the burden was on defendant not only to show error but also to show that the error complained of affected the result adversely to him. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 489</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 116 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly determined that in-court identifications were not tainted
   
   by a pretrial photographic procedure, where the court found upon supporting voir dire evidence that the witnesses had ample opportunity to observe defendant during the course of the robbery in question; the in-court identifications of defendant were of independent origin based solely on what the witnesses saw at the time of the robbery and did not result from any out-of-court confrontation, photograph, or pretrial identification procedure; and the pretrial photographic procedures were not so unnecessarily suggestive as to lead to irreparable mistaken identification. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 489</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 116 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's Recordation of Findings.
   
   - Defendant was not prejudiced by any error that might have resulted from a proceeding, conducted after an evidentiary hearing outside the presence of the jury and after the trial court ruled on defendant's suppression motions in open court, in which the judge merely recorded his own observations with the aid of the prosecutor and a witness; the record was silent as to whether the defendant was present or absent. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 287</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 799 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1117, 121 S. Ct. 868, 148 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of Confrontation Clause Was Not Shown.
   
   - Where defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine both witnesses in his murder trial the confrontation clause was not violated as to the victim's grandmother's testimony concerning what she told the defendant and as to the letter written from the victim to the defendant, authenticated by two witnesses. State v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 675</cite>, 375 S.E.2d 156 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        A capital murder defendant's confrontation rights were not prejudicially violated by his absence from an in-chambers conference, where the court allowed the defendant's request to record the trial in its entirety and discussed possible sequestration of certain witnesses, because these discussions did not relate in any material way to the pending charges. State v. Hayes, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 154, 502 S.E.2d 853 (1998), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 79</cite>, 511 S.E.2d 302 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearsay testimony concerning statements made by a child to a licensed psychological associate during an evaluation interview by a medical center's child sexual abuse team did not violate the defendant's confrontation rights, where the child was found incompetent to testify, and the statements were found to be trustworthy in that they were made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment, and there was no evidence that law enforcement officials were involved in the decision to evaluate the child. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. App.</cite> 488, 504 S.E.2d 84 (1998), aff'd in part and modified in part, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 413</cite>, 527 S.E.2d 644 (2000).

        Defendant's confrontation rights under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 were not violated when the trial court refused to allow defendant to cross-examine the witness about the witness's disciplinary record, as there were confidentiality concerns about the record pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsVIa29s115C-402" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-402</a></cite>, and defendant failed to show how the disciplinary record was relevant to impeach the witness's credibility under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008C.html#t8Cs8C-1" target="_blank">G.S. 8C-1</a></cite>, Rule 608(b). State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 451, 584 S.E.2d 86 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error in the limitation on defendant's cross-examination of the victim where the reasons for her unwillingness to testify and the possibility of her being held in contempt did not bear on her credibility or bias toward defendant, nor was whether she believed defendant had been tried "enough" relevant to any matter at issue in the trial. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 616 S.E.2d 306 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant's cross-examination was not restricted by law, and the trial court did not limit the scope of the examination, defendant's only limitation in cross-examining the police captain was his inability to play the lost videotape to the jury, and defendant had ample opportunity to cross-examine the captain regarding the quality of the videotape, his viewing of the videotape, and about what he saw on the videotape; defendant's confrontation rights under the Sixth Amendment were vindicated and his right to confrontation under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   23 was not violated. State v. Thorne, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 393, 618 S.E.2d 790 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to presence was not violated when the trial judge met with the jury to thank them for their service before discharging them because the jury's service was complete at the time; the meeting occurred after the jury had delivered a unanimous verdict, had been polled, and the trial court recorded the verdict. State v. Badgett, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 234</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 206 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to confrontation was not violated when the trial court refused to allow defendant to cross-examine a witness regarding the witness's alleged biased because there was no evidence that the witness, an inmate, received concessions for participating in the case against defendant. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 648 S.E.2d 896, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 704</cite>, 653 S.E.2d 878 (2007), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 372</cite>, 664 S.E.2d 560 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not show that law enforcement officers' statements identifying defendant by defendant's nickname constituted inadmissible hearsay and, thus, defendant did not show a prerequisite for a Confrontation Clause violation, namely, that hearsay was involved; the law enforcement officers' identification of defendant was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted, but instead was admitted to show why their investigation focused on defendant in a case where defendant shot another person. State v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 653 S.E.2d 892 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subpoena defendant served on an out-of-state witness called by the State was invalid because the witness was in North Carolina pursuant to the State's summons and thus, the trial court did not err in releasing the witness after he testified for the State. State v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. App.</cite> 64, 763 S.E.2d 577 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's challenge to the admission of recorded phone calls failed because, even if the recordings contained hearsay, the evidence was overwhelming and, thus, there was no possibility of a different outcome had the jury not heard the phone calls, and because the recorded statements made by the women defendant talked to while in jail were not testimonial, the statement's admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause. State v. Roberts, - N.C. App.
   - , 836 S.E.2d 287 (2019), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">374 N.C. 269</cite>, 839 S.E.2d 350, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 293 (N.C. 2020).

       </p>
       <p>
        Brevity and Reliability of Witness.
   
   - Where testifying witness observed defendant during the day, from a short distance, and long enough to notice his unseasonable clothing, witness's identification of him was not too brief and therefore not inherently incredible, and its admittance into evidence was not violative of his due process rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

   19 and 27. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unavailable Witness.
   
   - Where the record demonstrated the necessity for using hearsay declarations (in this case, unavailability of the witness), and the inherent trustworthiness of the declarations, defendant's confrontation rights were not violated. State v. Deanes, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 508</cite>, 374 S.E.2d 249 (1988), cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1101, 109 S. Ct. 2455, 104 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where child victim was unavailable to testify against defendant/father, admission of hearsay statements did not infringe upon the defendant's constitutional right to confront witnesses. State v. Pretty, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 517 S.E.2d 677, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 117</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 745 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject Matter of Bench Conference.
   
   - No error where the court documented the subject matter of the bench conference, either at the time of the conference or later in the transcript, and the record demonstrated that none of these conferences implicated defendant's right to confrontation. State v. Harden, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 542</cite>, 476 S.E.2d 658 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of the trial court to grant defendant's requested recess
   
   so that defendant could get a bench warrant for a defense witness did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment right under the United States Constitution to have compulsory process to obtain witnesses and his right under the North Carolina Constitution to confront his accusers with witnesses and other testimony pursuant to this section. State v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 750</cite>, 487 S.E.2d 751 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's exclusion of defendant's proposed cross-examination regarding co-defendant's outstanding warrants
   
   was reasonable in view of its repetitive and cumulative effect, was at any rate harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt, and was not a violation of the North Carolina Constitution. State v. McNeil, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 657</cite>, 518 S.E.2d 486 (1999), cert. denied, 529 U.S. 1024, 120 S. Ct. 1432, 146 L. Ed. 2d 321 (2000).

       </p>
       <p>
        Although a juvenile was not present during an evaluator's testimony by conference call,
   
   excluding him was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, as the conference call occurred in the presence of the juvenile's counsel, who cross-examined the witness, the substance of the conference call was placed on the record, the evaluator's opinion was reduced to writing and available to all parties, and the juvenile did not object to his own absence. In re Lineberry, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 572 S.E.2d 229 (2002).

        New Trial Ordered Where Detective Allowed to Read a Witness' Statement Taken During Questioning.
   
   - Defendant's confrontation clause rights were violated when a trial court allowed a detective to read into evidence a statement the detective took while questioning a suspect in a stolen goods case; regardless of whether the man was unavailable, the statement was testimonial since it was taken in the course of interrogations and defendant had not had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the man regarding his statements; since that was the State's only evidence showing defendant knew the items he possessed were stolen, the error was not harmless and defendant was entitled to a new trial on charges of possession of stolen goods in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa06s14-17.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-17.1</a></cite>.

        <b>
         Requested Instructions.
        </b>
        - In defendant's conviction for robbery with firearm, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's requested jury instructions that the victim had an interest in this case because of pending criminal charges; although the trial court's instruction was more general than defendant's requested instructions, it substantially conformed with defendant's request, and defendant was also allowed to cross-examine the victim regarding the pending criminal charges, and was allowed to argue the point to the jury. State v. Geddie, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Feb. 18, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Continuance Motion.
   
   - Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a continuance where the State, in defendant's attempted first-degree murder and assault with a deadly weapon case, presented defendant with a statement on the morning of trial that it had obtained from the man who had allegedly sold defendant the gun used in the shootings involved in defendant's case; defendant had not shown evidence that he would have been better prepared had the motion to continue been granted or that he was materially prejudiced by the denial of his motion, and defendant was given a recess by the trial court to allow his counsel to interview the man. State v. Bethea, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 43, 617 S.E.2d 687 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional right to presence at trial was not violated by the denial of motions for continuance because defendant's absence from the second and third days of trial was only explained by contact with a defense witness, not defense counsel or the trial court, indicating that defendant was in the hospital with chest pains; a letter indicating that defendant had been in the hospital for observation did not offer a diagnosis or prognosis, and, thus, no medical emergency was shown, so defendant's absence could not be deemed involuntary. State v. Russell, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 625, 655 S.E.2d 887 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of motion for a continuance to secure the attendance and testimony of a sergeant as a necessary and material witness for the defense was not erroneous because defendant did not articulate any specific facts about which the sergeant would testify and which would substantiate defendant's defense. State v. Walston, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 134, 666 S.E.2d 872 (2008).

        Defendant's Presence During Drawing of Prospective Jurors.
   
   - Defendant was not deprived of his right to presence under the confrontation cause of the Constitution of North Carolina, as nothing suggested that the clerk failed to draw prospective jurors at random, in open court, and in defendant's presence. State v. Badgett, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 234</cite>, 644 S.E.2d 206 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Harmless Error.
   
   - While a trial court found juror misconduct violating defendant's constitutional rights where a juror looked up a drug on the Internet, the trial court properly denied a motion for appropriate relief because the constitutional violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where there was no reasonable possibility that the mentioning of the Internet finding could have had an effect on an average juror.

        Right to Counsel Guaranteed.
   
   - An accused's right to counsel in a criminal prosecution is guaranteed by the U.S. Const., Amend. VI and is applicable to the states through U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19 and this section. State v. Shores, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 402 S.E.2d 162 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant has the constitutional right to be represented by counsel
   
   whom he has selected and employed. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 497</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 520 (1948); State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the State and federal Constitutions secure to every man the right to be defended in all criminal prosecutions by counsel whom he selects and retains. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 176 S.E.2d 41 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Guarantee Effective Assistance.
   
   - The right to counsel is not intended to be simply an empty formality, but is intended to guarantee effective assistance of counsel. State v. Mathis, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 660</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 245 (1977); State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 231</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 332 (1978); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional right to counsel has long been recognized as an entitlement to the effective assistance of counsel. State v. Vickers, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 90</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 599 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to counsel does not guarantee the best available counsel,
   
   errorless counsel, or satisfactory results for the accused. State v. Sneed, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 606</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 867 (1974); State v. Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to select his own counsel cannot be insisted upon in a manner that will obstruct
   
   an orderly procedure in courts of justice, and deprive such courts of the exercise of their inherent powers to control the same. State v. Poole, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 308</cite>, 289 S.E.2d 335 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Counsel May Be Forfeited
   
   - The defendant forfeited his right to counsel and the trial court did not err by requiring him to proceed pro se, without conducting an inquiry pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>, where he was twice appointed counsel as an indigent, each time releasing his appointed counsel and retaining private counsel. Defendant was disruptive in the courtroom on two occasions, refused to cooperate with his counsel and assaulted him, resulting in an additional month's delay in the trial. State v. Montgomery, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 521, 530 S.E.2d 66 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court may find that a criminal defendant has forfeited the right to counsel. In such a case, the court is not required to follow the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>, which the court would otherwise be required to do before permitting a defendant to proceed pro se. A finding that a defendant has forfeited the right to counsel requires egregious dilatory or abusive conduct on the part of the defendant which undermines the purposes of the right to counsel and prevents the trial court from complying with <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>.

       </p>
       <p>
        Absent egregious conduct by the defendant, a defendant must be advised of the right to counsel, the consequences of proceeding without counsel, and the nature of the charges and proceedings and the range of permissible punishments before the defendant can proceed without counsel. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>. Thus, where the defendant's behavior was not so egregious as to prevent the court from proceeding, or to create a danger of any kind, forfeiture of the constitutional right to counsel has not occurred. State v. Simpkins, - N.C.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant had not engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of the right to counsel where his untimely objection, questions, and speaking out of turn for 20 minutes at the start of the proceeding before he was required to proceed pro se, while frustrating to the court, was not so egregious as to frustrate the purposes of the right to counsel. Moreover, nothing in the record suggested that he was rude or disrespectful to the trial court. State v. Simpkins, - N.C.
   - , 838 S.E.2d 439 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in determining that defendant forfeited his constitutional right to counsel because forfeiture required egregious misconduct that obstructs or delays the proceedings, and nothing in the record indicated that defendant's difficulty cooperating with his two court-appointed attorneys had delayed or obstructed the proceedings. State v. Patterson, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (July 21, 2020).

        The rights of communication go with the man into the jail,
   
   and reasonable opportunity to exercise them must be afforded by the restraining authorities. The denial of an opportunity to exercise a right is a denial of the right. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).

        Communication Not Limited to Receiving Professional Advice from Attorney.
   
   - Under this section, a defendant's communication and contacts with the outside world are not limited to receiving professional advice from his attorney. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant is entitled to consult with friends and relatives and to have them make observations of his person. The right to communicate with counsel and friends necessarily includes the right of access to them. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a person is a defendant's lawyer, as well as his friend, does not impair his right to see the defendant at a critical time of the proceedings. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).

       </p>
       <p>
        The refusal of a jailer to permit the defendant's attorney to confer with him
   
   while he was in jail is a denial of a constitutional right. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 176 S.E.2d 41 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).

         Denial of Opportunity to Consult with Counsel, Family or Friends.
        </b>
        - Where defendant was held in custody for nearly ten days without the opportunity to consult with counsel, or confer with his own family and friends, or have his interests protected, and was questioned during this entire period intermittently, denied sleep, and removed from one place to another, all the time being denied the opportunity to consult with counsel or friends, or appear before a committing magistrate, and other requirements such as being fully advised of his constitutional rights were not properly afforded defendant, his rights under this section were directly violated.

        Counsel Must Have Opportunity to Investigate, Prepare and Present Defense.
   
   - Since the law regards substance rather than form, the constitutional guaranty of the right of counsel contemplates not only that a person charged with crime shall have the privilege of engaging counsel, but also that he and his counsel shall have a reasonable opportunity in the light of all attendant circumstances to investigate, prepare and present his defense. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 279, 176 S.E.2d 41 (1970), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The right to the assistance of counsel includes the right of counsel to confer with witnesses, to consult with the accused and to prepare his defense. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972); State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Implicit in the constitutional right to effective counsel is that an accused and his counsel shall have a reasonable time to investigate, prepare and present the defense. State v. Minshew, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 593, 235 S.E.2d 866 (1977).

        Amount of Preparation Time.
   
   - Effective assistance of counsel, as guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. VI and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19 and this section, is denied unless counsel has adequate time to investigate, prepare and present his client's defense. Even so, no set time is guaranteed and whether a defendant is denied effective assistance of counsel must be determined upon the circumstances of each case. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978); State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The circumstances surrounding the trial court's denial of the defendant's motion to continue did not demonstrate that it was unlikely that the defendant could have received effective assistance of counsel. The defendant failed to offer evidence tending to establish a violation of his constitutional right to a reasonable time to investigate, prepare and present his defense for murder charge and did not show that he had inadequate time to confer with counsel or that counsel had inadequate time to prepare for trial. State v. Tunstall, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 320</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 331 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Responsibility of Defendant for Lack of Preparation Time.
   
   - The conduct of a defendant in failing either to retain counsel or to avail himself of his right to court appointed counsel, if he is indigent, may make him solely responsible for any lack of trial preparation on the part of his counsel. State v. McDiarmid, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 243 S.E.2d 398 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was offered an opportunity to contact counsel, and he assured officers that he would seek his own counsel to assist him, and continued to assure the officers that he intended to employ private counsel, defendant's constitutional rights were not violated by eight days' delay in appointment of counsel. State v. Avery, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 459</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 142 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3209, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1209 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Failure to Grant Continuance is Denial of Effective Assistance.
   
   - Where after the convening of the term the trial court ordered a special venire from another county to try defendant for rape, and counsel for defendant challenged the array on the ground that persons of defendant's race had been excluded from the jury list solely because of their race, but the court refused the request of counsel for time to investigate and secure evidence in support of such challenge to the array, although counsel obtained evidence from members of the special venire and bystanders of the courtroom tending to sustain the challenge, it was held that as it appeared that defendant was prejudiced by denial of reasonable opportunity to procure evidence in support of his challenge to the array, a new trial would be awarded for the denial of defendant's constitutional right to be properly represented by counsel. State v. Speller, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 345</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 294 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless counsel suggests the existence of material witnesses or information that would possibly lead to material evidence or material witnesses, the mere failure to grant a continuance in order to make an investigation would not, in and of itself, constitute a denial of effective assistance of counsel. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for kidnapping and assaulting a policeman with a firearm, the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion for a continuance where the 17 days defendant's counsel had to prepare for trial was not a reasonable time under the circumstances. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 643, 251 S.E.2d 647, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 178</cite>, 254 S.E.2d 39 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant was entitled to a new trial because the court's denials of his repeated motions for a continuance resulted in a violation of his constitutional rights to effective assistance of counsel, to confront his accusers, and to due process of law. Defendant's counsels had only thirty-four days to prepare for a complex, bifurcated capital case, involving multiple incidents in multiple locations over a two-day period, which they took over from another attorney who had done little other than filing pretrial motions while trying to persuade the defendant to accept a plea bargain. No evidence existed that any witness interviews had been performed; the orders based on the trial court's rulings on pretrial motions had not been prepared; and a jury questionnaire was not submitted for distribution to prospective jurors. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 119</cite>, 529 S.E.2d 671 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err or violate defendant's constitutional rights in denying defendant's motion for a continuance to permit defendant to procure an expert witness to evaluate and testify as to the State of North Carolina's DNA evidence because defendant had sufficient time to review the evidence against defendant and to procure the assistance of an expert, but simply failed to do so in time. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 742 S.E.2d 315 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There are no set rules to determine whether a defendant has been deprived of effective assistance
   
   of counsel; rather each case must be approached upon an ad hoc basis, viewing circumstances as a whole in order to determine this question. State v. Hensley, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 231</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 332 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of inadequacy of representation cannot be determined solely upon the amount of time counsel spends
   
   with the accused or upon the intensiveness of his investigation. State v. Sneed, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 606</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 867 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test of effective assistance of counsel
   
   is whether the assistance given was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases. State v. Vickers, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 90</cite>, 291 S.E.2d 599 (1982); State v. Scober, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 469, 328 S.E.2d 590 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial could not be relied on as having produced a just result. State v. Dockery, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 336 S.E.2d 719 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Farce and Mockery of Justice Test.
   
   - The incompetency of counsel for the defendant in a criminal prosecution is not a constitutional denial of his right to effective counsel unless the attorney's representation is so lacking that the trial has become a farce and a mockery of justice. State v. Sneed, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 606</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 867 (1974); State v. Mathis, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 660</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 245 (1977); State v. McDiarmid, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 230, 243 S.E.2d 398 (1978); State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Each case must be approached upon an ad hoc basis,
   
   viewing the circumstances as a whole, in order to determine whether an accused has been deprived of effective assistance of counsel. State v. Sneed, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 606</cite>, 201 S.E.2d 867 (1974); State v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C.

       <p>
        Breach of Attorneys' Duty Does Not Automatically Require Reversal.
   
   - The duties of an attorney representing a criminal defendant include the duty of loyalty, a duty to advocate defendant's cause, and the duty to consult with defendant, investigate defendant's case and keep defendant informed. However, a breach of one of these duties does not automatically require reversal of defendant's conviction. Defendant must also demonstrate that the professionally unreasonable conduct of his counsel resulted in prejudice to defendant. State v. Dockery, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 336 S.E.2d 719 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For case upholding finding of fact that defendant's counsel was not ineffective but that if he was, defendant did not show any prejudice,
   
   see State v. Swann, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 666</cite>, 370 S.E.2d 533 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointment on Day Before Trial.
   
   - It is not ipso facto a denial of effective assistance because counsel were notified of their appointment and on the same day learned that the cases would be called for trial the following day. State v. Alderman, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 14, 212 S.E.2d 205 (1972), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 261</cite>, 214 S.E.2d 433 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflict of Interest.
   
   - Defendant's rights under the Sixth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 and 23 were not violated by the denial of defense counsel's motion to withdraw since an inquiry was conducted into counsel's allegation that counsel had a conflict of interest under N.C. Rev. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a) because a former client was called as a witness against defendant; there was no conflict since: (1) counsel had represented the witness three years prior to defendant's trial and was no longer representing the witness; (2) counsel had no recollection as to specifics of the witness's case aside from the fact that the witness had been convicted; (3) counsel's statement that counsel would review counsel's file to see if counsel had any information to help defendant proved that counsel was committed to defendant's case; and (4) counsel made significant inroads to undermine the witness's credibility. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 651 S.E.2d 924 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        As defendant was effectively forced to go to trial while represented by trial counsel who had previously represented one of the State's witnesses and who acknowledged being in the possession of confidential information which might be useful for purposes of cross-examining that witness, defendant was entitled to a new trial. State v. Gray, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 431, 736 S.E.2d 837 (2013), review denied, 747 S.E.2d 534, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 784 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Physical Incapacity.
   
   - The question of effective assistance of counsel involving the physical incapacity of counsel does not turn on the physical incapacity of counsel as such, since this may or may not deprive a defendant of effective representation. Rather, it is necessary to examine counsel's specific acts or omissions. The reviewing court must approach such questions ad hoc and in each case view the circumstances as a whole. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding the defense attorney's hearing disability, his efforts and the assistance of co-counsel provided defendant with effective legal representation throughout the criminal proceedings. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Improper Mitigating Factors Tendered.
   
   - The defendant's right to present a complete defense, including evidence of mitigating circumstances, pursuant to this section, was not violated by the exclusion of friend of defendant's statement regarding the effect defendant's death would have on him; a third party's feelings are irrelevant to the capital sentencing proceeding. State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 122</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 334 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 840, 122 S. Ct. 96, 151 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of Continuance to Prepare Closing Argument.
   
   - Defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel was not denied when the trial court refused to continue the trial to give the defendant's counsel the weekend to prepare a closing argument for the guilt-innocence determination phase of the trial; defense counsel's closing argument met an objective standard of reasonableness and was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in capital cases. State v. Laws, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 81</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 609 (1989), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1022, 110 S. Ct. 1465, 108 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of Testimony of Second Psychiatric Examination.
   
   - Defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated by admission of second treatment team's testimony as to information obtained during second court-ordered psychiatric examination, even though that admission was for the purpose of determining his capacity to proceed, as opposed to his sanity at the time of the crime; defendant had the opportunity to discuss with his lawyer whether or not to submit to the second court-ordered examination and to discuss its scope as well, and the absence of express language in the second order specifying defendant's examination to determine his mental state at the time of the offenses was not significant. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990), in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 532</cite>, 402 S.E.2d 577 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a murder prosecution, the admission of psychiatric testimony as to defendant's mental state at the time of the crime did not affect his right to counsel because he had placed his mental condition in issue when he moved to continue the trial due to his psychiatric illness and asserted the defense of diminished capacity and inability to formulate the intent to kill, and he had the opportunity to consult with counsel concerning the scope of the examination conducted by the testifying psychiatrist. State v. McClary, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 70, 577 S.E.2d 690, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 466</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 466 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that defendant was convicted
   
   does not show that his counsel was either incompetent, neglectful or ineffective. State v. Mathis, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 660</cite>, 239 S.E.2d 245 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden on Defendant to Show Supportable Defense.
   
   - In bringing an ineffective assistance claim based on the failure to adequately present a defense, the central question is whether a supportable defense could have been developed. The burden of showing the probability that this defense existed is on the defendant. State v. Dockery, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 190, 336 S.E.2d 719 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial Court Hearings on Effectiveness of Counsel.
   
   - The trial judge, who actually sees the lawyer's behavior, is better able than an appellate court to evaluate the overall effectiveness of representation. State v. Richards, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 474</cite>, 242 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant did not waive her right to conflict free counsel, she argued that she claimed possession of the heroin and the paraphernalia to protect her boyfriend, and because he was represented by defense counsel's boss, there was a potential for a conflict under N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 1.7(a); thus, a hearing should have been held. State v. Mims, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 403, 637 S.E.2d 244 (2006).

        The question of alleged failure of counsel to render effective representation can be considered on direct appeal.

       <p>
        Decision Not to Introduce Evidence.
   
   - The trial court's deferral of its ruling on whether introduction of certain evidence by defendant would open the door to permit the State to introduce irrelevant and prejudicial evidence about defendant's prior convictions did not improperly chill the defendant's rights to introduce evidence; his decision not to introduce the evidence was purely tactical and did not implicate any rights. State v. Holman, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 174</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 18 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 910, 122 S. Ct. 250, 151 L.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Ineffective Representation Shown.
   
   - The counsel's substandard performance was prejudicial to the rape defendant, where the defense's failure to produce any evidence to support the theories proffered at the outset of the trial, including consent of the victim and inability of the defendant to perform the alleged acts, formed the basis of one of the principal closing arguments made by the State in favor of conviction. State v. Moorman, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 387</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 502 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was denied the effective assistance of appellate counsel because (1) defendant showed counsel was objectively unreasonable when counsel did not raise dispositive authority establishing that the trial court's disjunctive jury instruction on a charge of possession of a weapon by a felon was plain error, including an improper acting in concert instruction, when it was impossible for an appellate court to determine on which of two theories in the instruction defendant was convicted, and (2) defendant showed prejudice from counsel's error denying defendant the opportunity to have the case decided on the merits and a reasonable probability that, had appellate counsel cited the dispositive authority, defendant would have been granted a new trial. State v. Collington, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. App.</cite> 127, 814 S.E.2d 874 (2018), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 792</cite>, 820 S.E.2d 812, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 1041 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate counsel's performance was deficient in failing to challenge the trial court's findings of fact regarding the detectives' knowledge of the vehicle's inspection status at the time of the initial stop because it was not a strategic decision but rather was an oversight. Defendant was prejudiced because had counsel challenged the findings there was a reasonable probability that the court would have concluded that the finding that the stop was initiated because of the inspection violation was not supported by competent evidence as the detectives could not have known that the vehicle's inspection was expired at the time the vehicle was stopped. State v. Baskins, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 589, 818 S.E.2d 381 (2018), review denied, stay lifted, stay denied, 824 S.E.2d 409, 2019 N.C. LEXIS 250 (2019).

       <p>
        Defendant's Burden to Show Ineffectiveness of Counsel.
   
   - Defendant's first degree murder conviction for stabbing his wife to death was affirmed because defendant failed to show ineffective assistance of counsel as he did not meet his burden of showing a reasonable probability that, but for defense counsel's failure to raise an issue at trial, the result of his proceedings would have been different. State v. Nguyen, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 632 S.E.2d 197, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 653</cite>, 637 S.E.2d 189 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel failed because defendant failed to satisfy his burden that there was a reasonable probability that a different outcome would have occurred if counsel had presented additional evidence of defendant's drug and alcohol problem. State v. Laney, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 631 S.E.2d 522 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointment of Counsel for Limited Purpose of Furnishing Advice.
   
   - Defendant was not prejudiced in any respect by the appointment of counsel for the limited purpose of furnishing advice to him if so requested, even though defendant did waive counsel and conducted his own defense. State v. Harper, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 30, 202 S.E.2d 795, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 375</cite>, 205 S.E.2d 100 (1974).

       <p>
        Rule Requiring Objection to Evidence When Offered Applies to Unrepresented Defendant.
   
   - Unless necessary to obviate manifest injustice, the rule applicable to a represented defendant, that the admission of incompetent evidence alone is not ground for a new trial where there was no objection at the time the evidence was offered, applies equally to an unrepresented nonindigent defendant. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 322</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 858 (1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant is entitled to counsel at every critical stage
   
   of the proceedings against him. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a defendant is granted a general right to counsel to assist in his or her defense, that right does not attach to all events leading to trial. The right attaches only to "critical" stages of the proceedings, those proceedings where the presence of counsel is necessary to assure a meaningful defense. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 163</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 352, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1981), rehearing denied, 454 U.S. 1165, 102 S. Ct. 1041, 71 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Determining When Proceeding Is a Critical Stage.
   
   - In deciding whether a particular proceeding constitutes a critical stage, courts must focus their inquiry on whether the presence of counsel is necessary to preserve the defendant's basic right to a fair trial as affected by his right to meaningfully cross-examine the witnesses against him and to have effective assistance of counsel at the trial itself. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 163</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 352, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1981), rehearing denied, 454 U.S. 1165, 102 S. Ct. 1041, 71 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The guarantee of counsel only applies to "critical stages" of the prosecution, and what constitutes a critical stage is determined both from the nature of the proceedings and from the facts in each case. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">39 N.C. App.</cite> 728, 252 S.E.2d 100 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In Connection with Right to Testify.
   
   - Defendant was improperly forced to choose between testifying in defendant's own behalf or being represented by counsel at trial; by choosing to testify, defendant was forced to relinquish defendant's constitutional right to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23. The error was not harmless under subsection (b) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1443" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1443</a></cite> since the right to counsel was so basic to a fair trial that its infraction could never be treated as harmless error. State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 650 S.E.2d 656 (2007), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 89</cite>, 656 S.E.2d 280 (2007), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 89</cite>, 656 S.E.2d 280 (2007), State v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Administration of Gunshot Residue Test.
   
   - The administration of a gunshot residue test is not a critical stage of the criminal proceedings to which the constitutional right to counsel attaches. State v. Odom, <cite class="nc_code">303 N.C. 163</cite>, 277 S.E.2d 352, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 587 (1981), rehearing denied, 454 U.S. 1165, 102 S. Ct. 1041, 71 L. Ed. 2d 322 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Pretrial Identification Proceedings.
   
   - A defendant has a constitutional right to presence of counsel during a pretrial identification only when adversary judicial criminal proceedings have been instituted against him prior to the confrontation. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 272 S.E.2d 384 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant's initial forfeiture did not carry over to his resentencing hearing, and a new inquiry conducted pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite> was required for defendant to properly waive the right to counsel at the resentencing hearing; since no such inquiry occurred, defendant was deprived of the right to counsel at the resentencing hearing and was entitled to be resentenced. State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. App.</cite> 450, 697 S.E.2d 392 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Identification in One-Man Showup Conducted at Victim's Home.
   
   - The trial court properly admitted a burglary victim's in-court identification of defendant and evidence of the victim's identification of defendant in a one-man showup conducted at the victim's home within an hour after the crime and at a time when defendant was without counsel and had not waived counsel since (1) defendant was not entitled to counsel at the one-man showup because he was not in custody, (2) there was no reasonable possibility that the one-man showup could have led to a mistaken identification or contributed to defendant's conviction, and (3) the in-court identification of defendant by the victim was independent in origin and was not influenced by the showup. State v. Tann, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 89</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 720 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Lineup.
   
   - Accused is constitutionally guaranteed counsel at an in-custody lineup identification. When counsel is not present at the lineup, testimony of witnesses that they identified the accused at the lineup is rendered inadmissible, and any in-court identification is also rendered inadmissible, unless the trial judge first determines on a voir dire hearing that the in-court identification is of independent origin and is untainted by the illegal lineup. State v. Ingram, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 35, 200 S.E.2d 417 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless presence of counsel at a lineup is understandingly waived by the accused, testimony concerning the lineup must be excluded in absence of counsel's attendance. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Examination of Photographs.
   
   - Right to counsel's presence is not extended to out-of-court examinations of photographs which include a suspect, whether he is in custody or at liberty. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        An accused has no constitutional right to the presence of counsel when eyewitnesses are viewing photographs for purposes of identification, and this is true regardless of whether the suspect is at liberty or in custody at the time. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 582</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 326 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable Cause Hearing.
   
   - A probable cause hearing is a "critical stage" of the criminal process entitling an indigent person to appointed counsel if he desires assistance of counsel. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had waived his right to have assigned counsel at the preliminary hearing, but made a specific request for a lawyer prior to the selection of the jury at his trial in the superior court, he was entitled to be represented by counsel. State v. Haire, <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 198 S.E.2d 31 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Instructions.
   
   - The trial court committed reversible error by administering admonitions to the jurors out of open court and in the absence of the defendant, counsel, or a court reporter. State v. Payne, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 138</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 612 (1987); State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 101</cite>, 418 S.E.2d 471 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court erred in refusing to allow defendant's counsel to examine the questions that the jury posed in defendant's murder trial, the circumstances did not completely deprive defendant of counsel; after the trial court received the questions, the trial court merely repeated the original jury instructions that it had given and did not give any new instructions. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 207, 654 S.E.2d 730 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        What Constitutes Critical Stage Where Offense Involves Intoxication.
   
   - A critical stage has been reached in a defendant's case when, immediately after officers have interrogated the defendant and conducted their test for sobriety, they charge him with the offense of driving while intoxicated. The denial of counsel at this point makes it impossible for a defendant to have disinterested witnesses observe his condition and to obtain a blood test by a doctor - the only means by which defendant might prove his innocence. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant's guilt or innocence of driving while intoxicated depends upon whether he is intoxicated at the time of his arrest. His condition then is the crucial and decisive fact to be proven. Permission to communicate with counsel and friends is of no avail if those who come to the jail in response to a prisoner's call are not permitted to see for themselves whether he is intoxicated. In this situation, the right of a defendant to communicate with counsel and friends implies, at the very least, the right to have them see him, observe and examine him, with reference to his alleged intoxication. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 547</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 462 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial for Misdemeanors.
   
   - Defendant was not denied his constitutional right to counsel by failure of the trial court to appoint counsel to represent him in the consolidated trial of two misdemeanors, where neither offense was a serious offense, notwithstanding the fact that the maximum punishment for the two offenses could have been seven months. State v. Speights, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 32, 182 S.E.2d 204, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 137</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 152 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile Proceedings.
   
   - In order to comply with due process in a juvenile delinquency proceeding, the right of the juvenile to be represented by an attorney must be considered and an attorney provided or there must be a proper waiver of this right. In re Walker, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 356, 188 S.E.2d 731, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 28</cite>, 191 S.E.2d 702 (1972).

       <p>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a cardinal principle of criminal law
   
   that an indigent defendant has the right under U.S. Const., Amend. VI to assistance of counsel for his defense. State v. Luker, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 532, 310 S.E.2d 63 (1983), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. App.</cite> 644, 316 S.E.2d 309 (1984).

       </p>
       <p>
        Prompt appointment of counsel in a capital case is mandatory
   
   and is required by this section. State v. Pearce, <cite class="nc_code">266 N.C. 234</cite>, 145 S.E.2d 918 (1966).
   <br />

       <p>
        Statute Making Appointment of Counsel for Indigents Discretionary Held Unconstitutional.
   
   - Former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a01s15-4.1" target="_blank">G.S. 15-4.1</a></cite>, insofar as it purported to leave to the discretion of the trial judge the appointment of counsel for indigent defendants charged with serious offenses, was unconstitutional. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial judge must make an express finding as to defendant's indigency
   
   or lack of indigency. State v. Pickens, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 200 S.E.2d 405 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant is charged with a serious crime, it is important for the trial judge to determine in the first instance the question of indigency and for the record to show whether lack of counsel results from indigency or choice. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>

        Defendant is entitled to a detailed investigation into his economic situation.
   
   State v. Pickens, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 200 S.E.2d 405 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Absence of Standards.
   
   - The theory that right to counsel has been denied because of absence of definite standards for determining indigency has been rejected by the Court of Appeals. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 379, 219 S.E.2d 277 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Defendant Prejudiced by Insufficient Inquiry.
   
   - Although it was incumbent upon the trial court to make a more sufficient inquiry into defendant's financial status and to determine the question of his indigency, defendant was not prejudiced unless he could show that he did not voluntarily and intelligently waive counsel. State v. Pickens, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 63, 200 S.E.2d 405 (1973).
   <br />

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigent Defendant May Waive Right to Counsel.
   
   - The purpose of the statutory provision for appointment of counsel, at public expense, for indigent defendants is to put indigent defendants on an equality with affluent defendants in trials upon criminal charges. To deny, or to restrict the right of the indigent to waive counsel, i.e., to represent himself, while permitting the affluent defendant to exercise such right, has no reasonable relation to the objective of equal opportunity to prevail at the trial of the case. Such classification is beyond the power of the legislature. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).
       </p>

   19 and 23 by continuing to question defendant after appointed provisional counsel arrived at the sheriff's office and requested to see defendant where defendant voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, initialed the form, and did not request an attorney at any time before he made a statement. State v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 103</cite>, 711 S.E.2d 122 (2011), cert. denied, 132 S. Ct. 1541, 2012 U.S. LEXIS 1493, 182 L. Ed. 2d 176 (U.S. 2012).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant may Represent Himself.
   
   - A defendant in a criminal proceeding has a right to handle his own case without interference by, or the assistance of, counsel forced upon him against his wishes. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972); State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 498, 211 S.E.2d 539 (1975), overruled on other grounds, State v. Barnes, 3<cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 380 S.E.2d 118 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant on the trial of a criminal case, including a coram nobis proceeding at which the defendant is present and witnesses are to be examined and cross-examined, has a right to conduct and manage his own case pro se. The right to act pro se is a right arising out of the federal Constitution and not the mere product of legislation or judicial decision. State v. Mems, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 658</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 164 (1972).

        Revocation of Waiver of Appointed Counsel.
   
   - Trial court did not err when the court allowed defendant to be represented by counsel because there was no evidence that the trial court expressly forced appointed counsel on defendant; after defendant voluntarily revoked his waiver of appointed counsel and informed the trial court that he would no longer represent himself but would be represented by his court-appointed attorney, the trial court ensured that representation by the court-appointed attorney was fully defendant's choice before the court appointed defense counsel.

        Request for Substitution of New Counsel.
   
   - Trial court's denial of defendant's request to have appointed counsel removed was not error, because appointed counsel was an experienced attorney and defendant's disagreements as to trial strategy and defense counsel's questioning on cross-examination was not sufficient to render counsel's assistance ineffective.

        Facts Held Insufficient to Sustain Finding of Nonindigency.
   
   - The fact that the defendant was a painter capable of earning $60.00 per week when he was able to obtain work and that he had made little, if any, effort to secure counsel, either privately or by court appointment, was not sufficient to sustain a finding that he was not indigent at the time of trial and, therefore, not entitled to a court-appointed attorney when one was requested at the trial.

        Right to Represent Oneself.
   
   - A defendant's right to represent himself is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; by this section of the North Carolina Constitution; and by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>.

        Defendant was deprived of the constitutional right to self-representation because defendant was not allowed to represent himself despite the fact that the record showed that defendant was competent, understood, and voluntarily exercised his free will, the trial court clearly expressed its that opinion it would be mistake for defendant to represent himself and warned defendant he would have to "play by the rules."

        Right to Counsel May Be Waived.
   
   - A defendant in a criminal proceeding, whether at trial or in pretrial proceedings, may waive his right to counsel if he does so freely and understandingly and with full knowledge. State v. Cobb, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 1</cite>, 243 S.E.2d 759 (1978); State v. Hyatt, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 513 S.E.2d 90 (1999).

        First degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery with dangerous weapon convictions were affirmed since the trial court's decision to admit a videotape of the defendant's post-Miranda interrogation was properly based on substantial evidence that he (1) signed a waiver of, and (2) never made a clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal assertion of his right to counsel, and did not assert his right to remain silent.

       <p>
        Defendant Need Not Know the Source of the Right Before Waiving It.
   
   - The court disagreed with contention by the defendant that in order to waive his right to counsel a defendant must have explained to him his right to counsel under U.S. Const., Amend. VI and under this section. If a defendant is told he has a right to counsel, as the defendant was, he does not have to know the precise source of the right before waiving it. State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        What Record Must Show on Waiver.
   
   - The record must show, or there must be an allegation and evidence which show, that an accused was offered counsel but intelligently and understandingly rejected the offer. Anything less is not waiver. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).

        Duty of Court to Determine If Defendant Has Waived Right to Counsel.
   
   - The constitutional right of an accused to be represented by counsel invokes, of itself, the protection of the trial court, which imposes the serious and weighty responsibility upon the trial judge of determining whether there is an intelligent and competent waiver of counsel by the accused. While an accused may waive the right to counsel, whether there is a proper waiver should be clearly determined by the trial court, and it would be fitting and appropriate for that determination to appear upon the record. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 50</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 245 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the voir dire evidence is conflicting and contradictory on the question of whether a defendant waived his right to counsel, it is incumbent upon the trial judge to weigh the credibility of the witnesses, resolve the crucial conflicts and make appropriate findings of fact. State v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 522</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 371 (1976).

   23 that defendant's decision to proceed pro se was knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made because: (1) defendant did not show that defendant appreciated the consequences of proceeding without counsel, or that defendant understood that murder was punishable by death; (2) it was not sufficient that defendant agreed that defendant had been afforded excellent legal counsel, or that defendant claimed the decision was made without "haste" and was "something that (defendant had) thought about for quite some time"; and (3) that defendant's responses were clear and succinct and that defendant was calm and revealed no sign of confusion, reticence, or hesitation could not substitute for the required inquiry.

       <p>
        Defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing because the trial court failed to ensure that he validly waived his right to counsel prior to the resentencing hearing, as after defendant stated he wished to proceed pro se, the trial court only requested that he sign a form waiving his right to counsel and conducted no further inquiry before proceeding with the hearing.

        Affirmative Showing of Waiver by State.

        Motion or Request to Withdraw Waiver of Counsel Not Shown.

        Right to Counsel Held Waived.
   
   - Even though counsel was appointed for defendant, he waived the right to have counsel when he initiated a conversation and volunteered statements to investigators without being questioned; neither his Fifth Amendment nor his Sixth Amendment rights were violated and his statements were properly admitted at his trial. State v. Boggess, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 676</cite>, 600 S.E.2d 453 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was no error to let defendant proceed pro se at a probation revocation hearing because (1) the court explained the charges, proceedings, and possible sentence and explained defendant's right to assigned counsel, in response to which defendant clearly and unequivocally asked to represent himself, (2) defendant said he understood the consequences of representing himself, and (3) he was 23 years old, spoke English, had a G.E.D., had attended college, had no known mental defects, and did not have to navigate complex evidentiary or procedural rules. State v. Faulkner, <cite class="nc_code">250 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 792 S.E.2d 836 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional rights to counsel were not violated because the trial court determined defendant elected to proceed pro se as defendant signed waiver of counsel forms and the court gave defendant years to find an attorney, advised and counseled defendant about the right to an attorney including the right to appointed counsel, counseled defendant on the complexity of handling a jury trial, and addressed the seriousness of the charges and advised defendant a conviction likely meant a life sentence.

       <p>
        Forfeiture of Right to Counsel.
   
   - Defendant, who appeared before at least four judges in 14 months, hired and fired counsel twice, was briefly represented by a public defender, refused to indicate his wishes with respect to counsel, advanced unsupported legal theories concerning jurisdiction, and claimed not to understand anything other than what was said on jurisdiction, and engaged in purposeful conduct and tactics to delay and frustrate the orderly process of the trial courts that resulted in a forfeiture of his right to counsel. State v. Mee, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 756 S.E.2d 103 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant did not waive the right to counsel, defendant's refusal to answer whether he wanted assistance of counsel at three separate pretrial hearings and his repeated and vigorous objection to the trial court's authority to proceed amounted to willful obstruction and delay of trial proceedings and, therefore, defendant forfeited his right to counsel. State v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. App.</cite> 510, 768 S.E.2d 896 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court violated defendant's constitutional right to counsel by requiring him to represent himself where he neither voluntarily waived his right to be represented by counsel nor engaged in such serious misconduct as to warrant forfeiture of his right to counsel without any warning that he would be required to represent himself or an inquiry under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite> to ensure that he understood the consequences of self-representation. The record showed that defendant was uniformly polite and cooperative, he did not deny the trial court's jurisdiction, disrupt court proceedings, or behave offensively, and he did not hire and fire multiple attorneys or repeatedly delay the trial. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">245 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 782 S.E.2d 88 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant forfeited defendant's right to court-appointed counsel because defendant's failure to hire defendant's own counsel over a period of years resulted in repeated delays in the case proceeding to trial.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant had to receive a new trial because he did not forfeit his right to counsel by engaging in serious misconduct or dilatory tactics after having been warned of the consequences as defendant was not combative or rude; there was no indication defendant had ever previously requested the case to be continued; and, as a whole, defendant's arguments did not appear to be designed to delay or obstruct the proceedings but overall reflected his lack of knowledge or understanding of the legal process. State v. Simpkins, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 826 S.E.2d 845 (2019), aff'd, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 98 (N.C. 2020).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No forfeiture of right to counsel.
   
   - Defendant did not forfeit his right to counsel, and the trial court deprived him of his right to counsel by denying his request to activate his standby counsel and therefore he was entitled to a new trial, because he twice requested appointment of substitute standby counsel, the trial court instead attempted to complete the colloquy required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1242" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1242</a></cite>, defendant clearly and unequivocally stated that he wished to waive his right to represent himself rather than waive his right to counsel, and stated no fewer than five times that he did not wish to represent himself at trial.

        Failure to Request Lesser Included Offense in Jury Instruction.
   
   - Defense counsel's decision not to request a charge on common law robbery as a lesser included offense to a charge of robbery with a deadly weapon was not ineffective assistance of counsel because that decision was a viable "all or nothing" trial strategy in which counsel hoped that the jury would find one element of the crime missing and then find defendants not guilty; counsel reasonably used that strategy in an attempt to preserve defendants' military careers, and the fact that the strategy failed did not mean defendants received ineffective assistance of counsel.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defense counsel's negative remarks about defendant's intelligence and decision making, at the sentencing hearing, did not amount to ineffective assistance,
   
   but were an attempt to show that defendant was not mentally capable of making an informed, reasoned decision and thus, should not be harshly sentenced. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. App.</cite> 770, 607 S.E.2d 5 (2005).

State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 544, 803 S.E.2d 196 (2017), review denied, writ denied, stay denied, mot. dismissed, as moot, 805 S.E.2d 690, 2017 N.C.

        Counsel's Strategic Decisions.
   
   - Applying the Wiggins test, North Carolina Supreme Court found that counsel for a death-sentenced defendant was not shown to be ineffective because counsel (1) was not under a mandate to second-guess two mental health experts that opined that certain tests were not necessary to determine whether the defendant had brain damage that would have indicated a murder was not intentional or indicated a mitigator, (2) had interviewed other persons regarding the defendant's behavior patterns to assist in formulating his own opinion, and (3) took into consideration that that particular brain injury defense was not proven to be effective based on the result of the first trial in which the defendant also received a death sentence; the highest court concluded that the counsel did not prematurely abandon a defense based on organic brain damage and that their election to pursue a defense/mitigation strategy predicated on other grounds constituted a reasonable professional judgment.

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, as counsel's decision to ask a witness about out-of-court statements made by defendant's cousin was a tactical decision, which an appellate court would not second guess. State v. Medina, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 723, 622 S.E.2d 176 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 366</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 448 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel's decision to pursue a theory of sexual asphyxiation or accident instead of suicide was a defense strategy that could not be second-guessed on appeal. State v. Scanlon, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. App.</cite> 410, 626 S.E.2d 770 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defense counsel's decision to address defendant's repeated lies to defense counsel and others was a prudent stop in pulling the sting from damaging evidence and did not amount to ineffective assistance. State v. Campbell, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 520, 629 S.E.2d 345 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant convicted of voluntary manslaughter did not show that defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 and, thus, defendant was not entitled to a reversal of defendant's convictions. Although defendant claimed that counsel's performance was deficient, defendant could not show that defendant did not receive a fair trial, as the claimed deficiencies involved either trial tactics, which were entitled to great deference on appeal, or matters that did not affect the outcome of the trial. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 754, 671 S.E.2d 545 (2009), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 379</cite>, 679 S.E.2d 840 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with first degree murder under the felony murder rule, trial counsel's alleged admissions of fact did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel because trial counsel made the challenged admissions of fact with defendant's consent and defendant expressly consented to counsel's strategy of attempting to persuade the jury that defendant neither intended to kill nor actually killed the murder victim. State v. Pemberton, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 743 S.E.2d 719 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Request Jury Instructions.
   
   - Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel's failure to request jury instructions where it was determined that the trial court did not commit error in failing to instruct the jury on those offenses; moreover, defendant was acquitted on two of the five charges submitted to the jury, so he was not prejudiced by counsel's performance. State v. Dickens, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. App.</cite> 632, 592 S.E.2d 567 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        As defendant's denial of his pointing of any gun was inconsistent with the defenses of necessity or justification, defendant's attorney made a tactical decision to present a theory of defense based upon defendant's own statements to police; as such, defense counsel's decision not to request jury instructions on necessity and justification with respect to a charge of assault by pointing a gun could not be ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Langley, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 194, 618 S.E.2d 253 (2005), cert. dismissed, and denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 366</cite>, 630 S.E.2d 447 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no plain error in the failure to provide a voluntary intoxication instruction to the jury, defendant's assertion of ineffective assistance of counsel with respect thereto failed; defendant's evidence concerning his low I.Q., smoking marijuana, and sharing alcohol over the course of an evening was not so overwhelming as to render the lack of a voluntary intoxication instruction prejudicial. State v. Andrews, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. App.</cite> 68, 612 S.E.2d 178 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Make Proper Motions.
   
   - Defendant's contention that he received ineffective assistance of counsel when his counsel moved for a mistrial as opposed to a new trial or appropriate relief after the jury had already returned its verdict failed where defendant failed to show any prejudice resulting from counsel's failure to make the proper motion. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 31, 591 S.E.2d 917 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not show counsel's assistance was ineffective for not arguing a warrantless blood draw's constitutionality because defendant showed no prejudice, as (1) defendant could be convicted based on an officer's opinion of appreciable impairment, and (2) evidence of impairment aside from the blood draw was overwhelming. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 802 S.E.2d 566, review denied, 807 S.E.2d 568, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 970 (2017).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Object to Chain of Custody.
   
   - Where defendant was convicted of raping a 13-year-old female, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to stipulate to the chain of custody of the products of conception to avoid introducing them into evidence; any error was harmless as there was no reasonable probability that the alleged error affected the outcome of the trial. State v. Watts, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 58, 616 S.E.2d 290 (2005), vacated in part, on other grounds, remanded, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 161</cite>, 2006 N.C. LEXIS 1402 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Object to Sentence.
   
   - Where defendant was sentenced within the presumptive range as a Level VI habitual felon, because he was given a very favorable plea bargain in which twenty-one felony offenses were consolidated for judgment with the original ten felony offenses such that defendant received no additional time for these twenty-one felonies, his sentence was upheld pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa81Bs15A-1340.12" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1340.12</a></cite>, and counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the sentence as violative of the Eighth Amendment and on grounds that legislative policy considerations constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. State v. Cummings, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 772, 622 S.E.2d 183 (2005), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 172</cite>, 641 S.E.2d 306 (2006), cert. denied, 550 U.S. 963, 127 S. Ct. 2441, 167 L. Ed. 2d. 1140 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Stipulation to Facts.
   
   - Mere fact that the State asked defendant to stipulate to a prior felony that did not correspond to the prior felony stated in the indictment did not render the error a substantive evidentiary one attributable to the State; instead, the record revealed an intention by defense counsel, after conferring with defendant, to stipulate to a prior felony and an assumption by the State that the stipulation relieved it of the burden of establishing that element of the possession of a firearm by a felon charge. State v. Mason, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. App.</cite> 206, 620 S.E.2d 285 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disclosure of Potentially Incriminating Information.
   
   - Under the unique and difficult circumstances here, with the already heavily incriminating evidence against defendant, as well as the apparent likelihood that the discovery of further incriminating evidence could be imminent, the attorneys' decision to disclose potentially incriminating information as to the location of the minor victim with the sought-after goal of avoiding imposition of the death penalty did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 797 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to identify anything that one attorney's allegedly inadequate investigation failed to uncover and that would have had any effect on the reasonableness of his attorneys' strategic decision to make the disclosure of the location of the minor victim, which was made after thorough investigation of law and facts relevant to plausible options; ineffective assistance was not shown. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 198</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 797 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Move for Dismissal.
   
   - Counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to dismiss the charge of first-degree burglary and the lesser included offenses at the close of evidence, as the victim's testimony that she was awakened by the loud noise of someone kicking the front door and that two men were standing over her father with guns in the room where the door was located, was sufficient evidence to show a breaking and entering took place. State v. Andujar, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 636 S.E.2d 584 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to make a motion to dismiss the robbery charge and the lesser included offenses because there was testimony that defendant told a witness that he and a friend had committed a robbery of some Mexicans and about some of the specifics of the way the crime was committed. State v. Andujar, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 636 S.E.2d 584 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Object to Questioning.
   
   - Where a prosecutor, during cross-examination in a second-degree murder trial, questioned defendant on the reason for omitting certain important facts from a voluntary discussion with a deputy, counsel's failure to object did not constitute ineffective assistance. State v. Ezzell, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 417, 642 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 432</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 390 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Object to Probation Condition.
   
   - Defendant's counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to a special condition of probation because it could not be said that the outcome of the probation revocation hearing would have been any different had counsel for defendant objected to the condition of probation. State v. Howell, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. App.</cite> 369, 646 S.E.2d 622 (2007), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 240</cite>, 660 S.E.2d 490 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Object to Polygraph.
   
   - Counsel's failure to object to the mention of defendant's having taken a polygraph test did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23, because given the very slight nature of the evidence, defendant could not show that without that evidence a different result would have been reached. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 259, 650 S.E.2d 650 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Request Recording.
   
   - Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, even though counsel did not request recordation under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1241ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1241(b)</a></cite> of opening/closing arguments, jury selection, and rulings on matters of law, as defendant acknowledged that defendant could not show prejudice. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 140, 651 S.E.2d 924 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Object to Testimony.
   
   Defendant's counsel did not provide ineffective assistance of counsel by not renewing an objection to the admissibility of a statement that defendant made to the defendant's spouse regarding the killing of the victim; the statement did not involve a confidential communication pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.008.html#t08a07s8-57ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 8-57(c)</a></cite> because it was made within the hearing of a third person and, thus, the statement was admissible. State v. Kirby, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 653 S.E.2d 174 (2007), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 241</cite>, 660 S.E.2d 493 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial counsel's failure to object to repeated characterizations of the police informant as a confidential and reliable informant (CI) and counsel's use of that designation did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel as defendant did not show prejudice since the State proved its case using a video recording of the controlled buy of narcotics by the CI showing the pill bottle and the money that exchanged hands, and did not rely on the credibility of the CI. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 714 S.E.2d 502 (2011), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 362</cite>, 718 S.E.2d 393, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 933 (2011), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 232</cite>, 747 S.E.2d 558, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 869 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial counsel's failure to object to hearsay and lay opinion that characterized a confidential informant (CI) as a prescription medication addict who was not a potential threat to other people but characterized defendant as a drug dealer who posed a greater threat to other people did not constitute ineffective assistance as defendant did not show prejudice since the State proved its case using a video recording of the controlled buy of narcotics by the CI showing the pill bottle and the money that exchanged hands, and did not depend on the credibility of the CI. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 436, 714 S.E.2d 502 (2011), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 362</cite>, 718 S.E.2d 393, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 933 (2011), cert. dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 232</cite>, 747 S.E.2d 558, 2013 N.C. LEXIS 869 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Object to Admission of Prior Conviction.
   
   - Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel when defendant's trial lawyer agreed to stipulate that defendant had a prior felony conviction, without insisting that the nature of the conviction not be disclosed to the jury, as defendant failed to prove that the prior conviction, possession of cocaine, equated with the charges of possession of a firearm by a felon and assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious bodily injury such that the jury was likely to have believed that if defendant possessed cocaine in the past, defendant was likely to have committed the charged offenses. State v. Tice, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 506, 664 S.E.2d 368 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel under State v. Harbison, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 175</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 504 (1985), during habitual felon proceedings; although counsel admitted defendant had three prior felony convictions, counsel never admitted defendant was an habitual felon. State v. Womack, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. App.</cite> 309, 712 S.E.2d 193 (2011).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Provide Notice of Intended Defenses.
   
   - Defendant failed to meet the burden of establishing ineffective assistance of counsel by counsel failing to provide notice of defendant's intended defenses at trial because there was no reasonable probability that the alleged error of counsel affected the outcome of the trial as defendant failed to present substantial evidence of either voluntary intoxication or diminished capacity. State v. McDonald, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 782, 663 S.E.2d 462, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 686</cite>, 671 S.E.2d 328 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel, when defendant was convicted of both second-degree rape and statutory rape predicated on a single act of sexual intercourse with the victim, because defendant could not have been prejudiced by ineffective assistance of counsel when a double jeopardy argument would have been unsuccessful at trial, as neither of the offenses was a lesser included offense of the other based on the separate and distinct elements that had to be proven. State v. Banks, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 652</cite>, 766 S.E.2d 334 (2014).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel Not Ineffective.
   
   - Since the trial court did not err in its jury instructions and there was no fatal variance, trial counsel was not ineffective for consenting to the jury instructions or in failing to argue that there was fatal variance between the allegations in the indictment and the evidence presented. State v. Nickens, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 821 S.E.2d 864 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel Not Ineffective for Failing to File Motion to Dismiss
   
   - Defendant's conviction of robbery with a dangerous weapon, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Va17s14-87" target="_blank">G.S. 14-87</a></cite>, was affirmed because defendant did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel based on a failure to move to dismiss the charge; the evidence was sufficient to support the charge, because the evidence established that defendant used a box cutter, which was classified as a dangerous weapon, and that the victim believed that his life was being threatened. State v. Pratt, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. App.</cite> 161, 587 S.E.2d 437 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the testimony of a middle school teacher that defendant, a juvenile, dragged her and struggled while the teacher was trying to prevent defendant from assaulting another student, the State had presented enough evidence for a charge of assault on a state employee in violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33ol1c4" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33(c)(4)</a></cite> to withstand a motion to dismiss. Thus, defense counsel was not ineffective for failing to renew the motion at the close of all of the evidence. In re A.V., <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 317, 654 S.E.2d 811 (2008).

       <p>
        Liberal Construction.
   
   - The Constitution ought to be liberally construed to preserve personal rights and protect the citizen against self-incriminating evidence. Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 386</cite>, 21 S.E. 196 (1895); State v. Medley, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 710</cite>, 100 S.E. 591 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional guaranties against self-incrimination should be liberally construed. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Remain Silent at All Times.
   
   - The right to remain silent does not arise when an arrestee is given his Miranda warnings. It is a right which he possesses at all times under U.S. Const., Amend. V and under this section. State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 265 S.E.2d 493, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 382</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 273 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional inhibition against self-incrimination is directed against compulsion,
   
   and not against voluntary admissions, confessions, or testimony freely given on the trial. Such statements, confessions, and testimony voluntarily given on a former trial are received against the accused as his admissions. State v. Farrell, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 804</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 560 (1944); State v. Sheffield, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. 309</cite>, 111 S.E.2d 195 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The privilege against self-incrimination is one against being compelled to testify. It furnishes no protection against the use of testimony which was voluntarily given. State v. Floyd, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 434</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 478 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant has a right not to be compelled to be a witness against himself
   
   in any criminal case. State v. Wills, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 546</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 328 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Privilege Protects Against Only Real Dangers.
   
   - The privilege against self-incrimination protects against real dangers, not remote and speculative possibilities, and a witness may not arbitrarily refuse to testify without existence in fact of a real danger, it being for the court to determine whether that real danger exists. Johnson County Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Grainger, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 256 S.E.2d 500, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 304</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 300 (1979); Shaw v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 496 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Court Determines Applicability of Privilege.
   
   - The witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in so doing he would incriminate himself. His say-so does not of itself establish the hazard of incrimination. It is for the court to say whether his silence is justified and to require him to answer if it clearly appears to the court that he is mistaken. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicability Depends upon the Case.
   
   - If a witness, upon interposing his claim of immunity, were required to prove the hazard in the sense in which a claim is usually required to be established in court, he would be compelled to surrender the very protection which the privilege is designed to guarantee. To sustain the privilege, it need only be evidenced from the implications of the question, in the setting in which it is asked, that a responsive answer to the question or an explanation of why it cannot be answered might be dangerous because injurious disclosure could result. The trial judge in appraising the claim must be governed as much by his personal perception of the peculiarities of the case as by the facts actually in evidence. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).

        Questions Subjecting Defendant to Punitive Damages.
   
   - This provision protects defendants from being required to answer questions, on an order of examination, which will necessarily tend to subject them to a verdict or an award of punitive damages, and to an execution against the person, the effect of which would be to deprive them entirely of their homestead exemption and of any personal property exemption over fifty dollars. Allred v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 31</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 186 (1964).

        Guaranty Extends to Any Proceedings Sanctioned by Law.
   
   - The constitutional guaranties against self-incrimination are to be liberally construed and they apply not only to criminal prosecutions but to any proceedings sanctioned by law, including examinations before trial. Allred v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 31</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 186 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The privilege against self-incrimination may be exercised by a witness in any proceeding. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination applies alike to civil and criminal proceedings, wherever the answer might tend to subject to criminal responsibility him who gives it. Johnson County Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Grainger, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 256 S.E.2d 500, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 304</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 300 (1979).

        Civil Actions Involving Arrest, Imprisonment or Execution Against the Person.
   
   - The constitutional protection against self-incrimination extends to civil actions that subject one to arrest, imprisonment or execution against the person. Shaw v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 496 (1985).

       <p>
        Privilege Extends to Pleading Stage of Civil Action for Punitive Damages.
   
   - A defendant may plead his privilege against self-incrimination in a civil action where the plaintiff asks for punitive damages, and the privilege applies to protect a party from self-incrimination at the pleadings stage of an action. Therefore, in an action to recover compensatory and punitive damages for alienation of affections and criminal conversation, where defendant refused to answer the allegations of plaintiff's complaint claiming his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, the trial court erred in deeming the allegations as admitted pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 8(d). Byrd v. Hodges, <cite class="nc_code">44 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 261 S.E.2d 269 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Refusal to Answer Interrogatories in Civil Action for Punitive Damages.
   
   - Fact that a plaintiff seeks punitive damages does not, ipso facto, entitle defendant to refuse, with impunity, to submit to requested discovery, where the responses, whether individually or collectively, would not necessarily tend to subject defendant to a punitive damages award. Stone v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">56 N.C. App.</cite> 473, 289 S.E.2d 898, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">306 N.C. 392</cite>, 294 S.E.2d 220 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a wrongful death action, defendant faced no peril of being subject to execution against the person for not satisfying a judgment for punitive damages, as there was no allegation in the complaint that would support the required statutory findings for execution against the person. Therefore, there was no basis for defendant declining to answer interrogatories on the grounds of self-incrimination. Shaw v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 496 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a wrongful death action, defendant could not have incriminated himself criminally by answering certain interrogatories, because, based on the same incident referred to in the complaint, he was charged with death by vehicle and driving while intoxicated, pled guilty, and complied with the judgments entered on the convictions. Shaw v. Williamson, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 604, 331 S.E.2d 203, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 669</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 496 (1985).

        Scope of Protection.
   
   - The fair interpretation of the clause that the defendant "shall not be compelled to give evidence against himself" seems to be to secure one who is or may be accused of crime from making any compulsory revelations which may be given in evidence against him on his trial for the offense. LaFontaine v. Southern Underwriters Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">83 N.C. 132</cite> (1880).

        Admissions Tending to Incriminate.
   
   - The protection against self-incrimination is not limited to admissions that would subject a witness to criminal prosecution; the privilege also extends to admissions that may only tend to incriminate. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Links in Chain of Evidence.
   
   - The privilege afforded against self-incrimination extends not only to answers that would in themselves support a conviction under a criminal statute, but likewise embraces those which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a crime. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971). See also, Smith v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 386</cite>, 21 S.E. 196 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        The protection afforded by the privilege against self-incrimination does not merely encompass evidence which may lead to criminal conviction, but includes information which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence that could lead to prosecution, as well as evidence which an individual reasonably believes could be used against him in a criminal prosecution. Johnson County Nat'l Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Grainger, <cite class="nc_code">42 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 256 S.E.2d 500, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 304</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 300 (1979).

       </p>
       <p>
        Silence in Face of Accusation of Guilt.
   
   - Defendant's silence in face of an accusation of guilt cannot be competent as an implied admission when the accusation is made during interrogation of defendant by officers of the law. To compel defendant to reply to an accusation under such circumstances on pain of having his silence considered against him would amount to an infringement of his constitutional right not to be compelled to incriminate himself. State v. Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 710</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 286 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's silence in the rightful exercise of his privilege against self-incrimination may not be considered an admission of the truth of incriminating statements made in defendant's presence by a prospective State's witness in response to an officer's questions. State v. Castor, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 286</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 848 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        If police officers properly warn an accused of his constitutional rights, his silence may not be used against him. State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 472</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 132 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an arrestee is the focus of suspicion, has been held in custody for a significant period of time without being advised of his Miranda rights, is aware of his right to remain silent, and makes it clear that he is relying on his right to remain silent, his in-custody silence in the face of accusation and possible prosecution cannot be the subject of cross-examination. State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 501, 265 S.E.2d 493, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 382</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 273 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where police officers told defendant that anything he said, or did not say,
   
   in response to statements made by an eyewitness could be used for or against him, their warning violated the provision of this section, which requires that no person charged with crime shall be compelled to give self-incriminating evidence. State v. Fuller, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 710</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 286 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessity of Advising Defendant of Rights Where Significantly Deprived of Freedom.
   
   - When an officer told defendant that he would get a warrant for him and would leave an officer at defendant's home until the warrant could be procured, defendant was deprived of his freedom in a significant way; it was therefore necessary to advise him of his rights before his answer to the question as to how long he had been at his home could be introduced into evidence. State v. Hoyle, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 232</cite>, 382 S.E.2d 752 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As to admissibility of in-custody silence for purpose of impeachment,
   
   see State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 680</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 558 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's failure to testify may not be considered an admission
   
   of the truth of testimony which tends to incriminate him. State v. Castor, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 286</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 848 (1974); State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 472</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 132 (1975).

        Adverse comments on defendant's failure to testify are impermissible.
   
   State v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 472</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 132 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was entitled to a new trial because the trial court erroneously overruled his objection to the prosecution's closing comments about defendant's decision not to testify in trial for felonious breaking or entering. The error was prejudicial and required a new trial. State v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 551</cite>, 434 S.E.2d 193 (1993).

        Defendant's Fifth Amendment and N.C. Const., Art I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 rights were violated where the prosecutor's statements referred repeatedly to defendant's silence, not merely to his behavior, and clearly urged the jury to infer that defendant was sane enough to know that remaining silent was in his best interest; the error was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt as the only real issue was whether defendant was legally insane at the time of the murder, three mental health experts testified that they believed defendant was legally insane, and lay witnesses and circumstances presented the only evidence of defendant's sanity. State v. Durham, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. App.</cite> 202, 623 S.E.2d 63 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        But May be Harmless.
   
   - The prosecutor's improper, slightly veiled, indirect comment on defendant's failure to testify was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Mitchell, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 309</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 830 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1000, 122 S. Ct. 475, 151 L. Ed. 2d 389 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that the prosecutor commented on defendant's failure to testify, the error was harmless given that defendant stipulated to his prior conviction and the evidence showing that he possessed the firearms found in his vehicle. State v. Martinez, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 284, 795 S.E.2d 386 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in allowing police officer's comments on murder defendant's decision to exercise her constitutional right to remain silent
   
   upon her arrest; the comments were elicited by the defense counsel and defense counsel repeatedly asked officer to explain his answers and did not object to, or move to strike the comments. State v. Jennings, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 579</cite>, 430 S.E.2d 188 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1028, 114 S. Ct. 644, 126 L. Ed. 2d 602 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statements made by prosecutor regarding the demeanor of the defendant
   
   was not comparable to statements previously held to be improper comments on a defendant's failure to testify. State v. Bates, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 564</cite>, 473 S.E.2d 269 (1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1131, 117 S. Ct. 992, 136 L. Ed. 2d 873 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutor Impermissibly Commented on Defendant's Silence.
   
   - State's cross-examination of defendant, examination of the officer, and closing argument attacked defendant's exercise of his right against self-incrimination in such a manner as to leave a strong inference with the jury that part of defendant's testimony was an after-the-fact creation; the prosecutor impermissibly commented on defendant's silence in violation of his rights under the North Carolina and federal constitutions. State v. Shores, <cite class="nc_code">155 N.C. App.</cite> 342, 573 S.E.2d 237 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Misstatement of Silence Jury Instruction.
   
   - The defendant's rights under this section were not violated by the trial court's misstatement that the defendant's failure to testify "creates into presumption against him" where the court went on to state, "therefore, his silence in this case is not to influence your decision in any way." State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 122</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 334 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 840, 122 S. Ct. 96, 151 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Remain Silent Not Violated.
   
   - Where the State did not ask detective whether defendant exercised his right to remain silent, he only testified that defendant was read his rights and indicated he understood those rights and no specific inquiry or argument was made about defendant's silence, defendant's exercise of his right to remain silent therefore was not used against him and his constitutional rights were not violated. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 422</cite>, 440 S.E.2d 268 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the prosecutor was directly responding to argument made by defendant relating to a specific piece of evidence and the argument did not relate to whether defendant himself sought to testify, it simply constituted a misstatement regarding the parties' relative rights to introduce the statement, not a comment on defendant's failure to testify. State v. Ratliff, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 610</cite>, 461 S.E.2d 325 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to remain silent under this section was not violated by the State's reference to his failure to assert his self-defense when he made spontaneous inculpatory statements prior to his arrest, nor by its reference to his post-arrest silence. State v. Washington, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. App.</cite> 354, 540 S.E.2d 388 (2000), cert denied, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 396</cite>, 547 S.E.2d 427 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's curative instruction to the jury following the prosecutor's comment at trial was sufficient, even though not made immediately after the prosecutor's comments, as the the trial court stated that the comment was improper, and the statement was followed by an instruction to the jury not to consider the failure of the accused to offer the accused as a witness. State v. Kemmerlin, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 446</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 870 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony that defendant declined to answer questions after he was arrested was harmless error because (1) the prosecutor did not solicit the testimony, which was offered in response to a question asking for a chronology of events surrounding defendant's arrest, (2) no further reference was made during the trial to defendant asserting his post-arrest right to remain silent, and (3) there was strong circumstantial evidence establishing defendant's guilt. State v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 80, 577 S.E.2d 683 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by allowing a detective to testify that defendant refused to make a statement to police because defendant did not object to that testimony during trial; in addition, the trial court did not have an obligation to give the jury a curative instruction, sua sponte, after a witness who testified stated during cross-examination that if defendant didn't agree with what the witness said, defendant should defend himself. State v. Batchelor, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 579 S.E.2d 422 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not violate defendant's right to remain silent where the police detective testified that defendant was quiet during questioning and often refused to respond to questions, and where the prosecutor referred to this testimony during closing arguments; the detective was asked about defendant's demeanor during questioning, not defendant's exercise of the right to remain silent, as defendant had waived defendant's Miranda rights and had agreed to speak with the detective. State v. Lyles, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 323, 615 S.E.2d 890, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 73</cite>, 622 S.E.2d 625 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a prosecutor, during cross-examination in a second-degree murder trial, questioned defendant on the reason for omitting from a voluntary discussion with a deputy such important facts as that the victim had been drunk, was possibly on cocaine, and had threatened defendant's life several times prior to the shooting, defendant's right to remain silent was not violated, because the cross-examination questions did not constitute an impermissible comment upon the invocation of the right, and any error was harmless. State v. Ezzell, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 417, 642 S.E.2d 274, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 432</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 390 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant contended that the trial court erred by overruling his objections to the prosecutors' closing arguments, the appellate court found that: (1) defendant's argument that the prosecutor's statements regarding defendant's failure to present mental health evidence or a mental health defense violated his constitutional right not to testify under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 was without merit because the State's argument highlighted the total lack of evidence at trial supporting the forecast of evidence by defense counsel in the opening statement and was not a comment on the failure of the accused to testify; and (2) defendant's argument that the prosecutor's arguments regarding the failure to present an accident defense violated defendant's right not to testify because defendant was the only person who could testify that the child's injuries were accidental was without merit because the prosecutor's comments were not directed toward defendant's failure to testify, but rather were directed to the lack of any mention of mental health or accident in the trial court's jury instructions, and the prosecutor's argument was a request to the jury to follow the trial court's instructions, and not to create legal issues during their deliberations that were not part of the trial court's instructions. State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 684 S.E.2d 450 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case in which defendant was convicted by a jury on two counts first-degree murder on the bases of felony murder and of malice, premeditation and deliberation and, after a capital sentencing proceeding, he was sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, defendant argued unsuccessfully on appeal that the trial erred by failing to intervene ex mero motu to exclude comments made by the prosecutor during closing arguments. The prosecution responded to defendant's attacks on two individuals and made permissible comments on defendant's failure to produce witnesses or exculpatory evidence to contradict or refute evidence presented by the State; the prosecution's remarks did not constitute a direct reference to his failure to testify and did not require a curative instruction. State v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. App.</cite> 204, 683 S.E.2d 437 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 857</cite>, 694 S.E.2d 766 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutor's questions to officers about defendant's lack of an explanation did not use defendant's exercise of the right to remain silent against defendant because nothing showed defendant was given Miranda warnings or at any time specifically invoked the right to remain silent. State v. Triplett, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 144, 810 S.E.2d 404 (2018).

        Comment on Prior Silence After Defendant Takes Stand.
   
   - With or without a
   <i>
    Miranda
   </i>
   warning, a defendant's right to remain silent is guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. V, as well as by this section. Any comment upon the exercise of this right, nothing else appearing, is impermissible. However, when a defendant chooses to testify in his own behalf, his U.S. Const., Amend. V right to remain silent must give way to the State's right to seek to determine, by way of impeachment, whether his prior silence is inconsistent with his trial testimony. The test is whether, under the circumstances at the time of arrest, it would have been natural for defendant to have asserted the same defense asserted at trial. State v. McGinnis, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 320 S.E.2d 297 (1984).

        Argument on Failure to Tell Police of Defense.
   
   - District attorney's question and argument to the jury as to defendant's failure to tell the police of his defense were prejudicial errors; since there was no eyewitness to the shooting other than defendant, and since his defense depended on the jury's acceptance of his version of the event, the State failed to demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that it was harmless to attack the credibility of his version by improper evidence, which improper evidence was reinforced by jury argument. State v. Hoyle, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 232</cite>, 382 S.E.2d 752 (1989).

       <p>
        Truth or Falsity of Statements.
   
   - The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination bars the introduction of all statements falling within its scope, without regard for their truth or falsity. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 390</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 572 (1951), overruled on other grounds, State v. Silver, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 709</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 247 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Forced Production of Incriminating Documents.
   
   - The protection afforded to defendants in criminal action by this section is a matter of absolute right to them, and extends to the forced production of letters and other papers in their possession that may tend to incriminate them upon the trial. State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 595</cite>, 132 S.E. 667 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        The introduction in evidence of incriminating papers taken from the defendant at the time of the arrest does not infringe the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination, under this section, and when he takes the stand in his own behalf he waives his constitutional right against self-incrimination. State v. Shoup, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 69</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 697 (1946), distinguishing State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 595</cite>, 132 S.E. 667 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination applies to the production of papers, so that if the accused is compelled to produce them the privilege is violated, lawful seizure of such evidence (as, for example, pursuant to a valid search warrant) obviously differs from requiring the accused to produce it and does not violate the privilege. State v. Downing, <cite class="nc_code">31 N.C. App.</cite> 743, 230 S.E.2d 581 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inapplicability of Privilege to Physical Evidence.
   
   - Upon trial of defendant for violating the prohibition law, the introduction into evidence of testimony of the officer making the arrest that he found a half-gallon jar of liquor on the person of the defendant was competent, and was not in violation of the constitutional provision that a defendant may not be compelled to give evidence against himself, the provision not applying to physical facts or conditions. State v. Hickey, <cite class="nc_code">198 N.C. 45</cite>, 150 S.E. 615 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        The admission of incriminating testimony of defendant's physical condition by witnesses who examined her without objection did not violate defendant's constitutional right not to be compelled to give evidence against herself, as provided in this section. State v. Eccles, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 825</cite>, 172 S.E. 415 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional guarantee that a defendant shall not be compelled to testify against himself, as provided by this section, does not preclude testimony by a witness as to marks on defendant's body tending to identify him as the perpetrator of the crime. State v. Riddle, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 591</cite>, 172 S.E. 400 (1934); State v. Floyd, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 434</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 478 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of the privilege against self-incrimination includes only the process of testifying by word of mouth or in writing. It has no application to such physical, evidential circumstances as may exist on the accused's body or about his person. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 390</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 572 (1951), overruled on other grounds, State v. Silver, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 709</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 247 (1975); State v. Paschal, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 795</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 749 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of the privilege against self-incrimination, in history and in principle, includes only the process of testifying by word of mouth or in writing, i.e., the process of disclosure by utterance. It has no application to such physical evidential circumstances as may exist on the accused's body or about his person. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Identifying Physical Characteristics.
   
   - Handwriting samples, blood samples, fingerprints, clothing, hair, voice demonstrations, even the body itself, are identifying physical characteristics and are outside the protection of the privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Greene, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 687, 184 S.E.2d 523 (1971), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 303</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 177 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distinguishing Marks.
   
   - Where witnesses for the State had testified as to a small scar near the culprit's left eye, a small mole on his left ear, and gold fillings in his teeth, upon return of the jury into the courtroom in disagreement as to defendant's identity as the culprit, the court did not commit prejudicial error in permitting a juror, with defendant's consent, to examine defendant's body for the distinguishing marks. State v. Floyd, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 434</cite>, 98 S.E.2d 478 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Chemical analyses of blood or breath
   
   are not within the protection of U.S. Const., Amends. V and XIV, or this section, as such chemical analyses are not evidence which is testimonial or communicative in nature. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. App.</cite> 111, 351 S.E.2d 828, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 227</cite>, 353 S.E.2d 404, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 409</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 887 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Blood and Urine Tests.
   
   - Where defendant pleaded insanity at the time of the homicide due to the continued use of liquor and opiates, and the record failed to show any compulsion on the part of the officers in obtaining specimens of defendant's blood and urine in order to ascertain the presence or absence of alcohol or morphine in his system, it was held that defendant's contention that the obtaining of the specimens compelled him to give evidence against himself, in violation of this section, was untenable. State v. Cash, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 818</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 277 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Expert testimony as to the results of a test of defendant's blood is admissible on the trial of a charge of driving a motor vehicle upon the public highways within the State while under the influence of intoxicating beverages. State v. Willard, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 259</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 899 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of evidence of a defendant's refusal to submit to a chemical test designed to measure the alcoholic content of his blood does not violate his constitutional right against self-incrimination. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Examination of Clothing.
   
   - No constitutional rights were invaded when an officer required defendant, who was accused of rape, to surrender for examination and analysis the clothing worn by him at the time the crime was alleged to have been committed. State v. Gaskill, <cite class="nc_code">256 N.C. 652</cite>, 124 S.E.2d 873 (1962); State v. Colson, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 295</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 376 (1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1087, 89 S. Ct. 876, 21 L. Ed. 2d 780 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of Footprints.
   
   - The constitutional privilege against self-incrimination is not violated by the introduction of evidence of footprints to identify the accused, even where these are obtained by coercion. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 390</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 572 (1951), overruled on other grounds, State v. Silver, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 709</cite>, 213 S.E.2d 247 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Photographs.
   
   - The admission of the photograph of a lineup including the defendant was not violative of his rights under this section or N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, where the photograph was properly identified and entered into evidence for the purpose of illustrating the testimony of a witness, and, although the defendant objected to the questions identifying the picture, he did not ask that its admission be restricted. State v. McKissick, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 500</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 112 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion Pictures.
   
   - Motion pictures of an accused in a criminal action are not per se testimonial in nature, and, where they are properly used to illustrate competent and relevant testimony of a witness, their use does not violate accused's privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a sound motion picture contains incriminating statements by the defendant made from his knowledge of the offense upon defendant's objection, the judge must conduct a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the in-custody statements or admissions contained in the sound picture. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Demonstration of Act of Killing.
   
   - Upon trial for murder in the first degree, where there is other circumstantial evidence of the prisoner's guilt, it is not duress to require the prisoner to place himself in such position as to show that he could have fired the fatal shot from a window and killed the deceased, as this is not considered as making a person furnish evidence against himself, it being dependent upon physical facts and conditions and not upon confessions or statements of the prisoner. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 238</cite>, 76 S.E. 249 (1912).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Positioning of Defendant for Purpose of Identification.
   
   - Testimony that defendant was placed for identification in the relative position to a witness as the perpetrator was seen by her just before committing a criminal offense is not objectionable as forcing defendant to give evidence against himself in denial of his constitutional rights. State v. Neville, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 731</cite>, 95 S.E. 55 (1918).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Who is Protected.
   
   - Immunity from self-incrimination extends not only to one who actually testifies as a witness, but also to the defendant in the trial, even if he declines to testify as a witness in his own behalf. State v. Hollingsworth, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 595</cite>, 132 S.E. 667 (1926).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The privilege against self-incrimination can be claimed only by the witness,
   
   and when it is claimed, it is guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. V, as well as by this section. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 46, 184 S.E.2d 906 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant who chooses to testify waives his privilege
   
   against compulsory self-incrimination with respect to the testimony he gives, and that waiver is no less effective or complete because the defendant may have been motivated to take the witness stand in the first place only by reason of the strength of the lawful evidence adduced against him. State v. Wills, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 546</cite>, 240 S.E.2d 328 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant waives his constitutional privilege not to answer questions tending to incriminate himself when he voluntarily testifies in his own behalf. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 805</cite>, 11 S.E. 1016 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever the defendant in a criminal action voluntarily testifies in his own defense he assumes the position of a witness and subjects himself to all the disadvantages of that position. In doing so, he acknowledges the right of the prosecution to test his credibility and he waives his constitutional privilege not to answer questions which tend to incriminate him or to prove the specific offense with which he is charged. State v. O'Neal, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 22</cite>, 120 S.E. 817 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was tricked or cajoled into waiving his right
   
   to counsel and his privilege against self-incrimination, and his statements to a State Bureau of Investigation agent therefore were not voluntary, where the evidence tended to show that defendant and his attorney went to SBI headquarters in Raleigh for defendant to be given a polygraph examination; defendant and his attorney were told that the examination would consist of the polygraph test itself and an interrogation; they were also told that the attorney could not be present during the test phase but that he would be allowed to be present during the interrogation phase; contrary to this advice, defendant's attorney was left outside the examination room during the test and the interrogation; the attorney, who could neither see nor hear what was transpiring, thought the testing phase was still in progress, and defendant himself apparently assumed that his lawyer would be admitted to the room at the proper time. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant Testifying May Be Cross-Examined on In-Custody Statements.
   
   - A trial court may properly allow the prosecuting attorney to cross-examine defendant with reference to in-custody statements for the purpose of impeaching defendant's trial testimony, notwithstanding the fact that defendant was not represented by counsel and had not waived the right to counsel when the statements were made. State v. Nobles, <cite class="nc_code">14 N.C. App.</cite> 340, 188 S.E.2d 600, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 626</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 472 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's privilege against self-incrimination was not violated where State was permitted to show for purposes of impeachment that defendant had not voluntarily turned himself in to the police after defendant had already testified to the contrary. State v. Lester, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 239</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 268 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecutor's impeachment of defendant by cross-examining him about his failure to tell officers, while making an in-custody statement, that he was acting to protect himself from attack when he shot deceased did not violate defendant's constitutional rights. State v. Haith, <cite class="nc_code">48 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 269 S.E.2d 205, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 403</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 449 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a capital murder case where defendant claimed to have been present when another person killed the victim, it was not improper for the State to cross-examine defendant as to defendant's failure, in post-arrest statements, to reveal the identity of the other person. State v. Fair, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 131</cite>, 552 S.E.2d 568 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in allowing the cross-examination of defendant in regards to his prior inconsistent statements because defendant failed to mention his story of a consensual sexual encounter on the night of the alleged offense to the detective which he later recalled with a high level of particularity during direct examination; such a memorable encounter would have been natural for defendant to recall at the time the detective was conducting his investigation; and the prosecutor did not exploit defendant's right to remain silent, but instead merely inquired as to why defendant did not remain consistent between testifying on direct examination and in his interview with the detective two years prior. State v. Wyrick, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. App.</cite> 534, 809 S.E.2d 608, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 113</cite>, 813 S.E.2d 238, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 368 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Questions About Prior Convictions on Cross-Examination.
   
   - Defendant's testimony on cross-examination about an additional conviction for assault with a firearm which he had failed to mention during his direct examination was relevant impeachment evidence; thus, it was not only proper but also prudent for the prosecutor to attempt to elicit further details about defendant's prior convictions. State v. Edwards, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 547, 272 S.E.2d 384 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Disclose Alibi Defense Prior to Trial Not an Inconsistent Prior Statement for Cross-Examination Purposes.
   
   - In a prosecution of defendant for possession and sale of heroin, where defendant was arrested and taken to a police station, indictments were read to him, and defendant interrupted the reading to state that he had not sold heroin to the person named in the indictments, defendant's failure to disclose his alibi defense to the police officers then, or to some other person prior to trial, did not amount to an inconsistent statement in light of his in-court testimony relative to an alibi, and the district attorney's cross-examination of defendant concerning failure to disclose his alibi was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a new trial. State v. Lane, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 382</cite>, 271 S.E.2d 273 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Accomplice Could Not Refuse to Answer on Cross-Examination After Incriminating Defendant.
   
   - An accomplice could not testify on direct examination to facts tending to incriminate defendant and at the same time refuse to answer questions on cross-examination relating to matters embraced in his examination-in-chief, and where he refused to answer relevant questions on cross-examination on the ground that his answers might tend to incriminate him, it was error for the court to refuse defendant's motion that his testimony-in-chief be stricken from the record, the refusal to answer the questions on cross-examination rendering the testimony-in-chief incompetent. State v. Perry, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 796</cite>, 188 S.E. 639 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant who, prior to his own indictment, gave testimony at codefendant's continuance hearing,
   
   placing himself in the company of the prosecuting witness on the evening in question, was not denied his privilege against self-incrimination, even though he was not represented by counsel or informed of his right against compulsory self-incrimination, despite the fact that codefendant's attorney, who had sought his testimony, was acting with the full complicity of the State, as defendant was not compelled to speak to his detriment. State v. Flowers, <cite class="nc_code">318 N.C. 208</cite>, 347 S.E.2d 773 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Pre-arrest warrantless recording of defendant's incriminating statements through witness
   
   did not violate defendant's right to be free of unreasonable search and seizure under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20, inasmuch as defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy regarding a conversation he voluntarily maintained with a confederate; the recording did not violate defendant's right under this section to be free from compulsory self-incrimination because his participation in the conversation was wholly voluntary, albeit ill-advised, and did not violate defendant's right under this section to counsel because the conversation in question occurred during the initial investigation of defendant prior to his arrest. State v. Levan, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 155</cite>, 388 S.E.2d 429 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Not Violated.
   
   - Defendant's alleged "Hobson's choice" between asserting her privilege against self-incrimination and her right to testify on her own behalf was illusory where trial court's denial of defendant's motion for a continuance in noncapital indictment for murder of stepson did not force defendant to choose between two constitutional rights but to make a purely tactical decision as to whether it would be more advantageous to testify in this trial, in her capital trial, in both trials, or not at all; defendant would have faced the same dilemma regardless of which case was tried first since any incriminating statements made at the first trial could later be used against her at the second trial. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">340 N.C. 264</cite>, 457 S.E.2d 841 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion to suppress incriminating statements made by him to a police officer while evidence was being presented during voir dire was properly denied since the statements made by defendant were spontaneous and did not warrant a conclusion that the officer should have known that he was about to elicit an incriminating statement from defendant by responding "so do I" when defendant commented he knew where a baseball cap had come from that was being presented as evidence; defendant's constitutional rights were not violated, because the officer's conduct did not constitute interrogation and no Miranda warning was required. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 763, 600 S.E.2d 16 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the court did not believe the prosecutor's questions were intended to focus the jury's attention on defendant's lack of cooperation with law enforcement following his arrest, even elevating the inquiry to a condemnation of defendant's silence could not amount to plain error when defendant made the same inquiry on cross examination. State v. King, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 347, 721 S.E.2d 336 (2012).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavit on Motion to Suppress.
   
   - Section 15A-977(a) requires an affidavit for a motion to suppress, but requiring the affidavit does not amount to compelling defendant to be a witness against himself in a criminal case in violation of U.S. Const., Amend. V and this section. State v. Gibson, <cite class="nc_code">32 N.C. App.</cite> 584, 233 S.E.2d 84 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Miranda Not Applicable to Abuse and Neglect Proceedings.
   
   - In case involving termination of parental rights, admission of mother's confession to injuring her child was not a violation of her Miranda rights; Miranda does not apply to civil juvenile abuse and neglect proceedings. In re Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 756, 561 S.E.2d 560 (2002), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 982, 123 S. Ct. 1799, 155 L. Ed. 2d 673 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Compelling Admission as Condition for Release Pending Appeal.
   
   - Trial court erred by denying a juvenile's release while his appeal was pending in part because he refused to admit committing the offenses for which he was adjudicated delinquent; compelling such an admission to win release violated the juvenile's self-incrimination privilege under the state and federal constitutions. In re Lineberry, <cite class="nc_code">154 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 572 S.E.2d 229 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusionary Rule Held Not To Apply To Evidence Obtained As Result of Faulty Confession.
   
   - Physical evidence obtained due to defendant's statements to police as to the location of the victim's body, obtained in violation of defendant's Miranda and Edwards rights, was not fruit of the poisonous tree and did not have to be suppressed under the exclusionary rule. State v. Goodman, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. App.</cite> 865, 600 S.E.2d 28, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 193</cite>, 607 S.E.2d 655 (2004).

        When Confession Is Admissible.
   
   - An extrajudicial confession by an accused is admissible against him when it is voluntarily given and is not induced by threats or fear, and when the defendant has knowingly and intelligently waived his right to have counsel present at the time the confession is given. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 264 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        First degree felony murder and conspiracy to commit robbery with dangerous weapon convictions were affirmed since the trial court's decision to admit a videotape of the defendant's post-Miranda interrogation was properly based on substantial evidence that he (1) signed a waiver of, and (2) never made a clear, unambiguous, and unequivocal assertion of his right to counsel, and did not assert his right to remain silent. State v. Ash, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 715, 611 S.E.2d 855, cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 66</cite>, 621 S.E.2d 878 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inadmissibility of Involuntary Confessions or Incriminating Statements.
   
   - Although Miranda warnings are required only when defendant is being subjected to custodial interrogation and are not required during the investigatory stage when defendant is not in custody at the time he makes the statement, all involuntary confessions or incriminating statements, made in custody or out, are ordinarily inadmissible for any purpose. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion of Second Confession After Improper First Confession.
   
   - Neither section 19 nor this section of N.C. Const., Art. I required the suppression of a defendant's second confession, made after proper warnings and the defendant's voluntary waiver of his constitutional rights, when that confession followed an earlier confession which had to be excluded under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966). State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 467</cite>, 428 S.E.2d 167 (1993), overruled in part on other grounds, State v. Buchanan, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 332</cite>, 543 S.E.2d 823 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of Guilty.
   
   - If a plea of guilty or nolo contendere is sustained, it must appear affirmatively that it was entered voluntarily and understandingly. State v. Ford, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 62</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 741 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination are necessary
   
   whenever law-enforcement officers question a person who has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his liberty in any significant way. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 92 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The ultimate test of the admissibility of a confession
   
   still remains whether the statement made by the accused was in fact voluntarily and understandingly made. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 92 (1975); State v. Garnett, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 211 S.E.2d 519, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 262</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 622 (1975); State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Every statement made by a person in custody as a result of an illegal arrest is not ipso facto involuntary and inadmissible, but the facts and circumstances surrounding such arrest and the in-custody statement should be considered in determining whether the statement is voluntary and admissible. Voluntariness remains as the test of admissibility. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admissibility depends upon whether the statement was freely and voluntarily made and whether the officers who elicited the statement employed appropriate procedural safeguards. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Question of voluntariness must be determined by the total circumstances of each particular case.
   
   State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980); State v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 368 S.E.2d 430 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the totality of circumstances indicates that defendant was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver of his rights, his statements are rendered involuntary as a matter of law. State v. Stephens, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 321</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 588 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a defendant's statement was in fact voluntarily and understandingly made, the court must consider the totality of the circumstances of the case and may not rely upon any one circumstance standing alone and in isolation. State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 320 S.E.2d 900 (1985), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 594</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 823 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant asserted that he had not slept nor eaten during the two days prior to his arrest, but failed to show by convincing evidence that he was impaired, intoxicated or coerced at the time he made statements to the police, the trial court did not commit reversible error by admitting defendant's statements into evidence. State v. Cheek, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 48</cite>, 520 S.E.2d 545 (1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1245, 120 S. Ct. 2694, 147 L. Ed. 2d 965 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion to suppress post-arrest inculpatory statements was properly denied in his trial for first-degree murder and for robbery with a dangerous weapon where the totality of the circumstances indicated that defendant had voluntarily made the statements, that his waiver of his Miranda rights was voluntary, intelligent, and knowingly made, that he never asked for counsel, that the conditions of the interview were of a non-coercive nature, that he was not on any substance or in need of food or bathroom breaks, and the fact that he had subnormal mental capacity did not, alone, render the statement incompetent; accordingly, there was no violation of his rights under this section and suppression of his statements was not required. State v. Mahatha, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 183, 578 S.E.2d 617, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 466</cite>, 586 S.E.2d 773 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mental Condition as a Factor.
   
   - Though defendant's mental condition is a factor to be considered, that factor standing alone will not render an otherwise voluntary confession inadmissible. State v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 368 S.E.2d 430 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant contended that the four and one-half hour delay in taking him before a judicial official after service of warrants was a coercive factor which rendered his confession involuntary, but he did not show any causal connection between the confession and the delay, no constitutional provision required exclusion of his statement on this ground. State v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 368 S.E.2d 430 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A confession obtained by the slightest emotions of hope or fear
   
   ought to be rejected. State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 509, 320 S.E.2d 900, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 594</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 823 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Miranda Warnings.
   
   - The fact that the technical procedural requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966) are demonstrated by the prosecution does not, standing alone, control the question of whether a confession was voluntarily and understandingly made, but the answer to this question must be found from a consideration of the entire record. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 92 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Custodial admonitions to an accused by police officers
   
   to tell the truth, standing alone, do not render a confession inadmissible. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 92 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Intoxication When Confession Is Made.
   
   - Where a defendant pleads drunkenness as a bar to the admissibility of his confession, unless defendant's intoxication amounts to mania - that is, unless he is so drunk as to be unconscious of the meaning of his words - his intoxication does not render inadmissible his confession of facts tending to incriminate him. The extent of his intoxication when the confession was made, however, is a relevant circumstance bearing upon its credibility, and is a question exclusively for the jury's determination. State v. McClure, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 288</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 693 (1972); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 439</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 242, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 45, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant claimed his Miranda waiver and confessions were affected by alcohol and precription drugs; the voluntariness of his Miranda waiver and confessions were supported by an officer's testimony that the defendant was attentive and very coherent and very understanding when he was read his Miranda rights. State v. Tuck, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. App.</cite> 61, 618 S.E.2d 265 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Intoxication Held Not to Preclude Conclusion of Voluntariness.
   
   - Where officers did not begin questioning defendant until some two hours after a blood alcohol test, and one officer explicitly testified that defendant appeared sober during the interview and spoke rationally and coherently, and the trial court specifically found that defendant was not under the influence of alcohol during the interview, the fact that defendant may have experienced some lingering, mild intoxication at the time of the confession did not preclude the conclusion that he confessed voluntarily. State v. McKoy, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 1</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 12 (1988), death sentence vacated and remanded on other grounds, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Confession Held Voluntary.
   
   - The granting of defendant's request to see his girlfriend and the mother of his child did not render his confession involuntary where the investigators's statements that they would attempt to contact the women were made only in response to defendant's request, where there was no evidence that investigators used the request as an inducement to obtain his confession, where investigators advised defendant that the police had no control over whether the women came to the station, where defendant himself stated that his confession was not thereby induced, and where the request had no relation to relief from the charges he faced. State v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 481</cite>, 528 S.E.2d 326, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1018, 121 S. Ct. 581, 148 L. Ed. 2d 498 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress incriminating statements he made to law enforcement, and properly admitted those statements at trial, as none of the tactics that defendant cited that were used by the detectives who questioned him rendered his confession involuntary or made his statements to police subsequently inadmissible. State v. Maniego, <cite class="nc_code">163 N.C. App.</cite> 676, 594 S.E.2d 242 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's post-Miranda statement was admissible because defendant was a 30-year-old high school graduate with experience in the criminal justice system based upon his numerous prior arrests, defendant was not threatened after being advised of his Miranda rights orally and in writing, defendant waived his Miranda rights orally and in writing, defendant did not ask to speak to an attorney, and the officers advised defendant of the charge, the possible sentence he could receive, the need for him to be truthful and help himself out by cooperating; and told defendant that if he cooperated his cooperation would be related to the district attorney's office and the judge. State v. Houston, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 367, 610 S.E.2d 777 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's first degree murder conviction was affirmed because the trial court did not err by denying defendant's motion to suppress his written confession as defendant's written waiver of his Miranda rights and his written confession were made understandingly, knowingly, and voluntarily with the assistance of a police officer who acted as defendant's interpreter. State v. Nguyen, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 447, 632 S.E.2d 197, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 653</cite>, 637 S.E.2d 189 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearing on Voluntariness.
   
   - When a purported confession of a defendant is offered into evidence and defendant objects, the trial judge, in the absence of the jury, hears evidence of both the State and the defendant upon the question of the voluntariness of defendant's statements. The general rule is that after such inquiry, when there is conflicting evidence offered at the voir dire hearing, the trial judge shall make findings of fact to show the bases of his ruling on the admissibility of the evidence offered. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 141</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 53 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        In-custody statements attributed to a defendant, when offered by the State and objected to by the defendant, are inadmissible for any purpose unless, after a voir dire hearing in the absence of the jury, the court, based upon sufficient evidence, makes factual findings that such statements were voluntarily and understandingly made by the defendant after he had been fully advised as to his constitutional rights. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 253</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 129 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the State offers a confession in a criminal trial and defendant objects, the competency of the confession must be determined by the trial judge in a preliminary inquiry in the absence of the jury. State v. Garnett, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 211 S.E.2d 519, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 262</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 622 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant challenges the admissibility of an in-custody confession, the trial judge must conduct a voir dire hearing to determine whether the confession was voluntarily made and whether the requirements of Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694, 10 A.L.R.3d 974 (1966) have been met. State v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 522</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 371 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Findings Unnecessary.
   
   - When there is no conflict in the evidence on voir dire, it is not error to admit a confession without making specific findings. State v. Biggs, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 522</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 371 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Trial Court's Findings.
   
   - Trial judge's findings as to the voluntariness of a confession, and any other facts which determine whether it meets the requirements for admissibility, are conclusive if they are supported by competent evidence in the record. State v. Garnett, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 489, 211 S.E.2d 519, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">287 N.C. 262</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 622 (1975); State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 264 S.E.2d 134 (1980); State v. Leak, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 351, 368 S.E.2d 430 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether an in-custody statement is voluntarily and understandingly made, the trial court's findings of fact are conclusive on appeal if supported by competent evidence. State v. Travatello, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 211 S.E.2d 467 (1975).
   <br />

       <p>
        Confession as a Condition of Probation Not Allowed.
   
   - Juvenile who was adjudicated to be a delinquent because of his sexual assault of another child could not be required, as a condition of his probation, to admit to the underlying offense, for purposes of treatment, without being granted use immunity or some other protection from the use of such an admission against him. In re Butts, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 609, 582 S.E.2d 279 (2003), review improvidently allowed, appeal dismissed sub nom. In re T.R.B., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 370</cite>, 595 S.E.2d 146 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review on Appeal.
   
   - Whether the conduct and language of investigating officers amounted to such threats or promises as to render a subsequent confession involuntary is a question of law reviewable on appeal. State v. Pruitt, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 442</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 92 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether conduct on the part of interrogating officers constitutes a threat or induces fear and whether a purported waiver has been knowingly and intelligently given are questions of law reviewable on appeal. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 264 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If the State offers a part of a confession,
   
   the accused may require the whole confession to be admitted into evidence. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 500</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 296, death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 809, 97 S. Ct. 45, 50 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1976).

       </p>
       <p>
        Court's denial of defendant's motion to suppress in-custody inculpatory statements
   
   he gave to law enforcement officers did not violate his constitutional rights. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inculpatory Statements of Codefendants.
   
   - Court did not err in allowing into evidence "sanitized" versions of purported statements by codefendants which were inculpatory of each other. State v. Ferrell, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 52, 264 S.E.2d 134 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of Confessions Upheld.
   
   - When a defendant has been given all the warnings required by the State and federal rules of evidence, and he understands them, and freely and voluntarily waives the right to have right to counsel and freely and voluntarily makes a confession, then the admission of this confession in evidence at a jury trial does not violate defendant's right against self-incrimination. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 181</cite>, 203 S.E.2d 781, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 867, 95 S. Ct. 123, 42 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court found that defendant was fully apprised of his rights to counsel and to remain silent, that he said he understood them, that he did not appear to be under the influence of drugs, and that he knew what he was doing, the trial court ruled correctly that his subsequent confession was admissible. State v. Travatello, <cite class="nc_code">24 N.C. App.</cite> 511, 211 S.E.2d 467 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant contended that his lack of sleep and food and his heavy use of drugs and alcohol shortly before his periods of interrogation rendered any in-custody statement involuntary, where after an extensive voir dire hearing the trial court found that defendant was not interrogated on the evening of his arrest because he was drunk, defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquors or drugs and was furnished food and coffee when interrogated on the following day, defendant was read his rights before questioning began, and defendant signed a waiver of his rights, the in-custody statement was freely, understandingly and voluntarily made and was therefore properly admitted into evidence. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 35</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 313 (1975), death sentence vacated, 429 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3212, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1211 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for armed robbery, the testimony of a witness employed as a dispatcher by the police department relating defendant's in-custody confession of guilt was admissible notwithstanding the dispatcher's failure to advise defendant of his constitutional rights, where the dispatcher questioned defendant while visiting a relative who shared defendant's cell, was not in any way acting as a police officer, and was not, in fact, a police officer. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 141, 223 S.E.2d 400, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 310</cite>, 225 S.E.2d 831 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for driving under the influence, the trial court did not err in admitting defendant's confession made to a police officer where the court found that defendant was properly advised of his rights; he knowingly waived his rights; he pointed to or told the officer of the wreck and described the location where he had the wreck; and his answers to the questions were free, voluntary, and not coerced by the officer; and the fact that defendant was intoxicated at the time of his confession did not require its exclusion. State v. Spencer, <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 507, 265 S.E.2d 451 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's findings of fact, not specifically excepted to by the defendant, fully supported its conclusions of law that defendant's statements to the police were freely, voluntarily and understandingly made and that none of the defendant's State constitutional rights were violated by his arrest, detention, interrogation or statements. State v. Cheek, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 48</cite>, 520 S.E.2d 545 (1999), cert. denied, 530 U.S. 1245, 120 S. Ct. 2694, 147 L. Ed. 2d 965 (2000).

   - Plain language of N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   23, prohibiting the assessment of costs against acquitted defendants, encompasses the appointment fee provided for by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-455.1(a)</a></cite>; by requiring payment of the appointment fee by acquitted defendants, the General Assembly devised a statutory framework that does not comport with the constitutional limitation prohibiting a criminal defendant from paying costs unless found guilty, and as such it may not stand. Accordingly, the appointment fee set out in

    §

   7A-455.1 is a cost of prosecution and may not be imposed upon a defendant in a criminal matter until that defendant has been convicted or pled guilty or nolo contendere. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).

Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   23 does not insulate acquitted defendants from bearing the burden of paying for their own counsel, but it does shield an acquitted defendant from having to pay for a system designed to reimburse the State for expenses necessarily incurred in the conduct of the prosecution. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).

    §
   </span>
   11 in N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 convincingly demonstrates North Carolina's continuing dedication to the principle that acquitted defendants should not be required to pay the costs of their prosecution; thus, requiring acquitted defendants to pay the appointment fee under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIXa36s7A-455.1" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-455.1</a></cite>, which was a cost of prosecution, would defeat the intent and purpose of either Constitution's provision. State v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 92</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 505 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of Witness Fees.
   
   - This provision, exempting an acquitted defendant from payment of necessary witness fees of the defense, does not require that they shall be paid by the public; the section operates only to deprive the witnesses of their common-law right to look to defendant for payment. State v. Hicks, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 829</cite>, 32 S.E. 957 (1899).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Assistance of a Pathologist.
   
   - Even though defendant's identity as the perpetrator of the crime charged was critical, and the state's case was built on circumstantial evidence, defendant failed to satisfy his burden of showing either that the assistance of a pathologist would have materially aided him in the preparation of his defense or that the lack thereof deprived him of a fair trial. State v. Moseley, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 1</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 412 (1994), cert. denied, 514 U.S. 1091, 115 S. Ct. 1815, 131 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1995).

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Right to Testify.
   
   - Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to reopen the case after defendant reconsidered his decision not to testify because the trial court had repeatedly asked defendant if he wished to testify, gave him the opportunity to talk to counsel, and defendant indicated that he did not want to testify. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 567, 823 S.E.2d 892 (2019).

      No person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court, except that a person accused of any criminal offense for which the State is not seeking a sentence of death in superior court may, in writing or on the record in the court and with the consent of the trial judge, waive jury trial, subject to procedures prescribed by the General Assembly.

        The defendant has an absolute constitutional right to plead not guilty and be tried by a jury.
   
   He should not and could not be punished for exercising that right. State v. Langford, <cite class="nc_code">319 N.C. 340</cite>, 354 S.E.2d 523 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Common-Law Principle.
   
   - It is a fundamental principle of the common law, declared in Magna Charta and incorporated in this section, that no person shall be convicted of any crime but by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The essential attributes of trial by jury,
   
   as guaranteed by this section, are the number of jurors, their impartiality and a unanimous verdict. State v. Dalton, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 507</cite>, 174 S.E. 422 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial as to Each Essential Element.
   
   - Defendant is entitled as of right to a jury trial as to every essential element of the crime charged, including the question as to his identity. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 438</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 177 (1968); State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 655</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 709 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is fundamental that one charged with a crime in this state is entitled, as a matter of right, under both the federal and State Constitutions, to a jury trial as to every essential element of the crime charged. However, the punishment imposed is generally not an element of the crime. State v. Field, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 331 S.E.2d 221, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 186</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 582 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial Court's Omission of Elements of Crime in Jury Instructions Reviewed Under Harmless Error Test.
   
   - In defendant's trial for felony murder and robbery with a dangerous weapon, while the trial court erred in instructing the jury on felony murder, any error violating defendant's jury trial right under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24 was harmless because there was no reasonable probability that outcome would have been different absent the error. State v. Bunch, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 841</cite>, 689 S.E.2d 866 (Mar. 12, 2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to be tried by one's peers of the vicinage is subject to the ability to secure a fair trial;
   
   both defendant and the State are entitled to a fair trial, and a fair trial requires an impartial jury; where it appeared necessary to judge to remove the case to some neighboring county in order to secure a fair trial, such removal to a neighboring county did not violate the constitutional prohibition. State v. Chandler, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 172</cite>, 376 S.E.2d 728 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>

        "Open
    Court" Not Applicable to Civil Proceedings.
   
   - This section is directed to an "open court" proceeding during a criminal conviction only, and it is not applicable to civil proceedings. WSOC Television, Inc. v. State ex rel. Att'y Gen., <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 448, 420 S.E.2d 682, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">333 N.C. 168</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 905 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Jury Trial.
   
   - Trial court did not err in allowing defendant to waive his right to a jury trial because his waiver was knowing and voluntary where it was made through his counsel, on the record, and in writing, arraignment was not mandatory, defendant never requested a formal arraignment, the hearing essentially served the purpose of an arraignment, the trial court was constitutionally authorized to accept defendant's waiver of his right to a jury trial, defendant made a strategic decision to ask for a bench trial, and he did not show on appeal how that decision prejudiced him. State v. Swink, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. App.</cite> 218, 797 S.E.2d 330 (2017).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Trial May Not Be Waived After Plea of Not Guilty.
   
   - A defendant in a criminal prosecution for a felony or a misdemeanor may not waive his constitutional right to trial by jury in the superior court after entering a plea of "not guilty" without changing his plea, nor may the General Assembly permit him to do so by statute; and where the court, after a plea of "not guilty," finds the defendant guilty without a jury trial, the judgment will be stricken out and the cause remanded. State v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 53</cite>, 182 S.E. 716 (1935). See also, State v. Muse, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 226</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 229 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        A jury trial cannot be waived in a criminal action; hence, where the facts were agreed upon by the State and the accused and submitted to the judge for his decision, it was held that such a procedure was not warranted by the law. State v. Holt, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 749</cite> (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a defendant enters a plea of "not guilty" in the superior court, he may not thereafter, without being permitted to change his plea, waive his constitutional right of trial by jury. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 656</cite>, 78 S.E. 293, 46 L.R.A. (n.s.) 38, 1914A Ann. Cas. 867 (1913). See also, State v. Hartsfield, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 357</cite>, 124 S.E. 629 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon defendant's appeal from judgment and sentence by the court after defendant had entered a conditional plea of guilty, the case would be remanded in order that a jury may pass upon defendant's guilt or innocence in accordance with defendant's constitutional right. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 170</cite>, 185 S.E. 662 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the superior court, on indictment originating therein, trials by jury in a criminal action cannot be waived by the accused. State v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 438</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 177 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is rudimentary that a trial by jury in a criminal action cannot be waived by the accused in the superior court as long as his plea remains "not guilty." State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant pleads not guilty in cases where a trial by jury is guaranteed by the organic law, he must be tried by a jury of twelve, and he cannot waive jury trial. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to a jury trial is not only guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but under the North Carolina Constitution the right also can not be waived by a defendant who pleads not guilty. State v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 33, 454 S.E.2d 271 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Thoughtful and full deliberation in an effort to achieve unanimity
   
   has only a salutary effect on our judicial system: It tends to prevent arbitrary and capricious sentence recommendations. State v. McCarver, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 364</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 25 (1995), cert denied, 517 U.S. 1110, 116 S. Ct. 1332, 134 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1996).

        Plea of Guilty Renders Jury Unnecessary.
   
   - A defendant may plead guilty, or nolo contendere, or autrefois convict, and the impaneling of a jury is unnecessary. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).

        <b>
         Closing Argument Referencing Not Guilty Plea Improper.
        </b>
        - Prosecutor's closing argument complaining about defendant's decision to plead not guilty violated his right to receive a fair trial and necessitated a new trial, given that defendants had an absolute right to plead not guilty and be tried by a jury. State v. Goins, - N.C. App.
   - , 839 S.E.2d 858 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction by Jury Necessary to Punishment.
   
   - It is fundamental that a defendant charged with crime, other than a petty misdemeanor, who pleads not guilty, may be punished only after conviction by a jury. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A criminal defendant may not be punished at sentencing for exercising his constitutional right
   
   to trial by jury. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 37</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it can reasonably be inferred from the language of the trial judge that the sentence was imposed at least in part because defendant did not agree to a plea offer by the State and insisted on a trial by jury, defendant's constitutional right to trial by jury has been abridged, and a new sentencing hearing must result. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 37</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 450 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial by a jury which is improperly constituted is so fundamentally flawed that the verdict cannot stand;
   
   thus, defendant was entitled to a new sentencing hearing where an alternate juror was substituted for a juror who was dismissed after participating in half a day of deliberations. State v. Bunning, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 253</cite>, 485 S.E.2d 290 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A party moving for a new trial grounded upon misrepresentation by a juror during voir dire must show:
   
   (1) the juror concealed material information during voir dire; (2) the moving party exercised due diligence during voir dire to uncover the information; (3) and the juror demonstrated actual bias or bias implied as a matter of law that prejudiced the moving party. State v. Buckom, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 368, 485 S.E.2d 319 (1997), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 973, 118 S. Ct. 425, 139 L. Ed. 2d 326 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Juror Misrepresentation Did Not Deny Defendant Right to Trial by Impartial Jury.
   
   - Defendant was not denied his rights to confrontation, to effective assistance of counsel, to due process, to a jury trial, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when the trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial based on the alleged misconduct of a juror; the juror inadvertent failure to disclose the 40-year-old information she had forgotten did not amount to concealment, and the juror demonstrated no bias. State v. Maske, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 40</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 521 (2004).

        Special Verdict in Trial for Nonsupport.
   
   - In a prosecution under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.049.html#t49a01s49-2" target="_blank">G.S. 49-2</a></cite>, a verdict upon the issues of paternity and nonsupport, if resolved in favor of the State, is sufficient to support a judgment against defendant without a general verdict by the jury of guilty. This does not contravene the provisions of this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 requiring trial and verdict by jury in criminal cases. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 446</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 840 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Instructions.
   
   - Defendant was not deprived of his constitutional rights, because no conflict existed between "Issues and Recommendation as to Punishment" form and oral instructions given by the trial court. State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 518</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 131 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1164, 120 S. Ct. 1181, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1087 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's curative instruction to the jury following the prosecutor's comment at trial was sufficient, even though not made immediately after the prosecutor's comments, as the the trial court stated that the comment was improper, and the statement was followed by an instruction to the jury not to consider the failure of the accused to offer the accused as a witness. State v. Kemmerlin, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 446</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 870 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge did not coerce the jury by giving an Allen charge because while the jury's note "clearly stated" that one juror would not change his or her mind, the trial court had discretion to reinstruct the jury in situations where it perceived a deadlock; the trial judge asked the jury, which had been deliberating for only 75 minutes, to continue to deliberate until 5:00 p.m. and instructed the jurors that they would resume deliberations the next morning if needed. State v. Blackwell, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 439, 747 S.E.2d 137 (2013).

        Jury Request to Review Testimony.
   
   - Both this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1233" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1233</a></cite> require the trial court to summon all jurors into the courtroom before hearing and addressing a jury request to review testimony, and to exercise its discretion in denying or granting the request. Failure of the trial court to comply with these mandates entitles defendant to press these points on appeal, notwithstanding his failure to object at trial. State v. Ashe, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 28</cite>, 331 S.E.2d 652 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial judge's response to the jury's request to review certain testimony by sending a message to the jury through the bailiff, rather than by addressing the jury as a whole in open court, though erroneous, was not prejudicial to defendant. State v. McLaughlin, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 564</cite>, 359 S.E.2d 768 (1987).

        Special Instruction to Jury Foreperson Violated Constitution.
   
   - Defendant's rights under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24 were violated as a jury foreperson received more than one instruction that the remaining jurors did not receive after the foreperson was ejected by the remaining jurors due to concerns about the foreperson's impartiality; defendant was entitled to a consistently-instructed jury under the constitution. State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 665 S.E.2d 751 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 478</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 325 (2009).

       <p>
        Judge's Communication with Jury Via Written Notes.
   
   - Judge's communication with jury in the jury room via written notes violated the requirements of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1233ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1233(a)</a></cite>; however, where the judge communicated with all jurors, his notes having been delivered to the jury as a whole, there was no violation of the North Carolina Constitution, and defendant failed to show other prejudice. State v. Colvin, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 374 S.E.2d 126 (1988), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 249</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 758 (1989).

       <p>
        Conversation Between Court and Juror.
   
   - Where the record established that the substance of a conversation between a juror and the court related to the juror's having "overheard something about the case," where the court excused the juror, and to insure that "no one should be suspicious" about his ability to be fair and impartial, this juror was removed from the case prior to deliberations, and where no other juror indicated that he or she had overheard anything about the case, the conversation between the court and the juror could not have influenced the verdict. State v. Harrington, <cite class="nc_code">335 N.C. 105</cite>, 436 S.E.2d 235 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>

   <span class="s1">
    §

   24 was preserved for review, even without an objection at trial under N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1). State v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. App.</cite> 359, 665 S.E.2d 751 (2008), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 478</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 325 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inquiry Into Alleged Communication Between Prosecution and Juror Was Not Required.
   
   - Trial court did not err by refusing to inquire further into an alleged communication between the prosecution and a juror where there was no indication that the alleged inappropriate communication had any influence on the juror or the verdict of the entire jury; there was no evidence that the juror heard what the assistant district attorney discussed with the clerk in the courtroom, in the presence of the court. State v. Jacobs, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 220, 616 S.E.2d 306 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inquiry by Trial Judge as to Jury's Numerical Split.
   
   - In the absence of a federal or state constitutional basis requiring the adoption of a per se rule, the court will look to the "totality of the circumstances" in evaluating a trial judge's inquiry as to a jury's numerical split. State v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 307 S.E.2d 794 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The context of inquiry as to the jury's numerical split may show that the inquiry is coercive, but such an inquiry is not inherently coercive or violative of this section's guarantee of the right to a trial by jury. State v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 307 S.E.2d 794 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        An inquiry into a jury's numerical division is often useful in timing recesses, in determining whether there has been any progress toward verdict, and in deciding whether to declare a mistrial because of a dead-locked jury. State v. Yarborough, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 307 S.E.2d 794 (1983); State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 304</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 389 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inquiries into the division of the jury are not a per se violation of this section when the trial court makes it clear that it does not desire to know whether the majority is for conviction or acquittal. Such inquiries are not inherently coercive, and without more do not violate the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the North Carolina Constitution. The appropriate standard is whether in the totality of the circumstances the inquiry is coercive. State v. Fowler, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 304</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 389 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge's questions about the numerical division of a jury do not constitute a per se violation of this section. Rather, the proper analysis is whether, in considering the totality of the circumstances, the inquiry was coercive. State v. Bussey, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 92</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 564 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge did not violate defendant's right to trial by jury by asking the jury about its numerical division on the issue of guilt when the jury could not reach a verdict on charges of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine by transportation, trafficking in cocaine by transportation, and maintaining a vehicle which was used for unlawfully keeping or selling controlled substances, or abuse its discretion by giving the jury an instruction on further deliberations, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1235" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1235</a></cite>. State v. Batchelor, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. App.</cite> 421, 579 S.E.2d 422 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The disjunctive phrasing of the jury instruction was not a fatal ambiguity
   
   which resulted in a nonunanimous jury verdict. State v. Oliver, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 202</cite>, 470 S.E.2d 16 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Polling of Jurors Was Proper.
   
   - Where each of the jurors individually was told the charges for which the jury had returned a guilty verdict and was asked whether this was their verdict and whether they still assented to the verdict there was no error in the manner in which the jury was polled. State v. Ramseur, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 502</cite>, 450 S.E.2d 467 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to inquire why jurors requested to be referred to by individual juror number the day after they returned guilty verdicts and were polled by name did not indicate that defendant was denied a fair trial;
   
   defendant's speculation that the jurors were influenced by the seizure suffered by defendant's mother after the verdict was returned or by defendant's attack of a law enforcement officer after the jury was removed from the court room was not enough to show exposure to external influence not was it a de facto indicator of prejudice. State v. Garcell, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 10</cite>, 678 S.E.2d 618 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge's Warning to Restrict Public Egress Was Proper.
   
   - Where trial judge informed those in the courtroom that he was concerned that the jury would be distracted by the movement of spectators in and out of the room and where he consequently warned them that if they wished to leave the courtroom, they should do so immediately, for they would not be allowed to do so after closing arguments began, barring an emergency, the order was not a denial of a public trial in violation of this section since judge did not vacate the courtroom nor bar the courtroom door without due warning to those within and without, and since the judge was authorized under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa59s15A-1034ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1034(a)</a></cite> to impose reasonable limitations on access to the courtroom. State v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 146</cite>, 377 S.E.2d 54 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearing Courtroom During Testimony of Child Rape Victim.
   
   - In a prosecution for first-degree rape of a child, the constitutional right of defendant to a public trial was not violated by the court's order that, during the testimony of the seven-year-old victim, the courtroom be cleared of all persons except defendant, defendant's family, defense counsel, defense witnesses, the prosecutor, the State's witnesses, officers of the court, members of the jury, and members of the victim's family. State v. Burney, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 529</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 693 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile Proceedings.
   
   - Constitutional guaranty of trial by jury has no application to a proceeding under the Juvenile Court Act. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a statute providing for a jury trial, it is almost universally held that in juvenile court delinquency proceedings the alleged delinquent has no right under the pertinent State or federal Constitutions to demand that the issue of his delinquency be determined by a jury. In re Burrus, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 517</cite>, 169 S.E.2d 879 (1969), aff'd sub nom. McKeiver v. Pennsylvania, 403 U.S. 528, 91 S. Ct. 1976, 29 L. Ed. 2d 647 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The bifurcated procedure that the legislature has established for impaired driving cases,
   
   with the jury determining whether <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-138.1" target="_blank">G.S. 20-138.1</a></cite> has been violated and the judge determining the length of punishment required under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-179" target="_blank">G.S. 20-179</a></cite>, is constitutional. State v. Field, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. App.</cite> 647, 331 S.E.2d 221, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 186</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 582 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the factors before the trial judge in determining sentencing are not elements of the offense, their consideration for purposes of sentencing is a function of the judge and is not susceptible to constitutional challenge based upon either the right to a jury trial under U.S. Const., Amend. VI or this section. State v. Denning, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 523</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 855 (1986), involving sentencing under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-179" target="_blank">G.S. 20-179</a></cite> for impaired driving.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Increase in Punishment Based on Aggravating Factor.
   
   - Trial judge's increasing of defendant's punishment under the Safe Roads Act of 1983 after a finding of a grossly aggravating factor, namely, that defendant had a prior conviction for a similar offense within seven years, did not in any way deprive defendant of his right to jury trial. State v. Denning, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 332 S.E.2d 203 (1985), modified and aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">316 N.C. 523</cite>, 342 S.E.2d 855 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Driver's License Revocation.
   
   - Since an action to revoke a driver's license is a civil action, jury trial is not necessary. State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 201 S.E.2d 704 (1973), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 229</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 15 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disbarment Proceedings.
   
   - In disbarment proceedings, respondent's exception on the ground that the proceedings deprived him of his right to trial by jury was untenable when the matters in issue were determined by a jury upon his appeal to the superior court. In re West, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 189</cite>, 193 S.E. 134 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Carolina Workers' Compensation Act

        Determination of Appropriate Sentence.
   
   - North Carolina courts have long adhered to the principle forbidding a trial court from improperly considering the defendant's exercise of her rights under this provision of the Constitution as an influential factor in determining the appropriate sentence.

        Defendant's right to a jury trial was violated where a sentence was enhanced based on the fact that he committed a crime while on probation; probationary status should have been a factor determined by a jury.

       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of an aggravated sentence on defendant's conviction for assault with a deadly weapon with intent to kill inflicting serious injury did not violate defendant's right to a jury trial because while <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa81Bs15A-1340.16" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1340.16</a></cite> did not apply based on when the crime occurred, a common-law procedural mechanism existed for submitted aggravating factors to the jury in the form of a special verdict; overwhelming evidence was presented that defendant shot a rival gang member in the rival gang member's territory, supporting the aggravating factor that defendant committed the crime to further or benefit the purposes of a criminal street gang. State v. Roberson, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 133, 641 S.E.2d 347, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 367</cite>, 646 S.E.2d 540 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not deprive the defendant of a fair trial by denying the defendant's pre-trial motion to continue
   
   the trial to a date more than 20 days after the defendant was charged in a true bill of indictment with habitual felon status; the assistant district attorney handling the case, notified the court that the State was not going to proceed with the habitual felon charge until a later date, if at all, and after the jury verdict was announced, the State dismissed the defendant's habitual felon indictment so that defendant was sentenced solely on the substantive charges against the defendant. State v. Adams, <cite class="nc_code">156 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 576 S.E.2d 377, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 166</cite>, 580 S.E.2d 698 (2003).

        Failure to Intervene Ex Mero Motu.
   
   - Defendant's rights to due process and a fair trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   18, 19, 23, 24, and 27 were not violated by the trial court's failure to intervene ex mero motu in the prosecutor's closing argument, as while comparisons between criminal defendants and animals were strongly disfavored, the state's use of an analogy to animals in packs helped explain the complex legal theory surrounding premeditation and deliberation. State v. Oakes, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 703 S.E.2d 476, review denied and dismissed <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 197</cite>, 709 S.E.2d 918, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 541 (2011).

        State's Recidivist Statutes Survive Double Jeopardy Challenges.
   
   - Recidivist statutes, or repeat-offender statutes, survived double jeopardy challenges because they increased the severity of the punishment for the crime being prosecuted, and they did not punish a previous crime a second time; the Apprendi and Blakely holdings did not extend to the habitual misdemeanor assault statute, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa08s14-33.2" target="_blank">G.S. 14-33.2</a></cite>.

         II. UNANIMOUS VERDICT OF TWELVE.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Jury Must Have 12 Persons.
   
   - It is elementary that the jury provided by law for the trial of indictments is composed of 12 persons; a less number is not a jury. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No More Than 12 Jurors.
   
   - If a defendant in a felony trial cannot consent to a trial by fewer than 12 jurors, it is clear that he cannot assent to deliberations by more than 12. State v. Rowe, <cite class="nc_code">30 N.C. App.</cite> 115, 226 S.E.2d 231 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A verdict by 11 jurors is a nullity,
   
   despite defendant's failure to assign his conviction by 11 jurors as error. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Unanimous Verdict of 12 Required.
   
   - A verdict of guilty rendered by a number of jurors less than 12 is unconstitutional. State v. Berry, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 363</cite>, 130 S.E. 12 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        No person may be finally convicted of any crime except by the unanimous consent of 12 jurors who have been duly impaneled to try his case. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        It has never been doubted that the Constitution of this State requires a unanimous verdict for a valid conviction for any crime. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 422</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 113 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        To convict a defendant, the jurors must unanimously agree that the State has proven beyond a reasonable doubt each and every essential element of the crime charged. State v. Jordan, <cite class="nc_code">305 N.C. 274</cite>, 287 S.E.2d 827 (1982); State v. McDougall, <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 1</cite>, 301 S.E.2d 308, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 865, 104 S. Ct. 197, 78 L. Ed. 2d 173 (1983); 501 U.S. 1223, 111 S. Ct. 2840, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1009 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was granted a new trial of the kidnapping charge because defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict was violated by virtue of the inclusion of the "removal" instruction; where the victim was moved a short distance of several feet, and was not transported from one room to another, the victim was not "removed" within the meaning of the kidnapping statute. State v. Boyd, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. App.</cite> 294, 714 S.E.2d 466 (2011).
   <br />
       </p>

        Verdict Unaffected by Subsequent Change of Mind.
   
   - If the jury is unanimous at the time the verdict is returned, the fact that some of them change their minds at any time thereafter is of no consequence; the verdict rendered remains valid and must be upheld. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 191</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 398 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Risk of Nonunanimous Verdict.
   
   - The risk of a nonunanimous verdict arises if the trial court instructs the jury that it may find the defendant guilty of the crime charged on either of two alternative grounds and each alternative ground constitutes a separate and distinct offense. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 512 S.E.2d 428 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no risk of a nonunanimous verdict where the statute under which the defendant is charged criminalizes a single wrong that may be proved by evidence of the commission of any one of a number of acts, and the court instructs the jury disjunctively as to various alternative acts that will establish an element of the offense, because in such a case the particular act performed is immaterial. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 512 S.E.2d 428 (1999).

        Determination of Ambiguity as to Verdict Unanimity.
   
   - If a statute criminalizes two or more discrete and separate wrongs, and a jury instruction permitting conviction on either of two alternative grounds possibly could result in a nonunanimous verdict, the court must examine the verdict, the charge, the jury instructions, and the evidence to determine whether any ambiguity as to unanimity has been removed. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 512 S.E.2d 428 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with 10 counts of statutory rape, the trial court submitted all 10 counts to the jury without differentiating among them, the indictment alleged 10 counts occurring between two dates, without specifying a date for any one charge, and the verdict sheets indicated guilty verdicts without specifying a particular offense, defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict was violated because it could not be said that the jury unanimously agreed that defendant committed any particular offense. State v. Holden, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 503, 586 S.E.2d 513 (2003), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 60</cite>, 602 S.E.2d 360 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the trial court's failure to ensure that each juror had in mind the same instances of abuse when voting to convict defendant of multiple counts of first-degree sexual offense and indecent liberties with a minor, defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict was jeopardized. State v. Bates, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. App.</cite> 27, 616 S.E.2d 280 (2005).

        Submission of an issue to the jury in the disjunctive is reversible error if it renders the issue ambiguous

        A verdict of guilty following submission in the disjunctive of two or more possible crimes to the jury in a single issue is ambiguous and therefore fatally defective. State v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 545</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 488 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        By instructing the jury that it could find defendant guilty of trafficking in marijuana if it found that defendant knowingly possessed or knowingly transported 10,000 pounds or more of marijuana, the trial judge submitted two possible crimes to the jury, as the jury could find defendant guilty if it found that he committed either or both of the crimes submitted to it. Thus, the jury's verdict of guilty was fatally defective because it was ambiguous, depriving defendant of his constitutional right to be convicted by a unanimous jury. State v. Diaz, <cite class="nc_code">317 N.C. 545</cite>, 346 S.E.2d 488 (1986).

        The trial court committed reversible error in instructing the jury that it could convict the defendant of first degree sex offense if it found that he forced the victim to perform either fellatio or anal intercourse, as defendant had a constitutional right to be convicted by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court, and under this instruction there was no way to tell whether the defendant was convicted of second degree sexual offense because the jury unanimously agreed that the defendant engaged in fellatio, anal intercourse, both fellatio and anal intercourse, or whether some members of the jury found that he engaged in fellatio but not anal intercourse, and some found that he engaged in anal intercourse but not fellatio. State v. Callahan, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 356 S.E.2d 403 (1987), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">93 N.C. App.</cite> 579, 378 S.E.2d 812 (1989).

        Instructions in a disjunctive form on the charge of maliciously assaulting in a secret manner were fatally ambiguous, thereby resulting in an uncertain verdict in violation of defendant's right to a unanimous verdict.

       </p>
       <p>
        A disjunctive jury instruction on a first-degree sexual offense did not risk a nonunanimous verdict by defining a sexual act as either cunnilingus or penetration, where the statutory definition of "sexual act" did not create disparate offenses, but merely enumerated alternative methods of showing the commission of a sexual act. State v. Petty, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 453, 512 S.E.2d 428 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the evidence presented by the State tended to show that the marijuana weighed 18 pounds, defendant testified that the weight of the box was about six or seven pounds, thus, the evidence could support an inference that defendant possessed and/or transported exactly 10 pounds of marijuana, which did not qualify as trafficking in marijuana under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-95ol1h1a" target="_blank">G.S. 90-95(h)(1)(a)</a></cite>. Considering the evidence and erroneous jury instructions that the jury should find defendant guilty if it found that he possessed "10 pounds or more but less than 50 pounds" of marijuana, the appellate court could not conclude that the jury unanimously convicted defendant under the conduct proscribed in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-95ol1h1a" target="_blank">G.S. 90-95(h)(1)(a)</a></cite>.

        Unanimous Verdict of Single Offense.
   
   - Permitting the jury to consider the DWI defendant's driving both at the time of the accident as well as when he later returned to the accident scene in his truck did not result in him being convicted on less than a unanimous verdict, since this section proscribes a single offense, not crimes in the disjunctive, and even if all jurors did not agree as to the time and extent of the defendant's drunkenness, they unanimously found him guilty of the single offense of impaired driving. State v. McCaslin, <cite class="nc_code">132 N.C. App.</cite> 352, 511 S.E.2d 347 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction for habitual impaired driving did not have to be overturned despite the fact that the verdict sheet given to the jury did not differentiate between the two statutory definitions of impaired driving, and thus it was not known which definition applied; the fact remained that the jury unanimously found defendant guilty of the single offense of impaired driving, which meant that defendant was not deprived of his state constitutional and state statutory right to a unanimous verdict.

        Trial judge correctly instructed jury
   
   that it could find immoral, improper, or indecent liberties with a child upon a finding that defendant either improperly touched his son or induced his son to touch him; the instruction did not permit conviction by less than a unanimous verdict. State v. Hartness, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 561</cite>, 391 S.E.2d 177 (1990).
       </p>

        Trial court committed no error in its instruction to the jury concerning the charges of indecent liberties with a child and first degree sexual offense by not requiring a finding of unanimity to each charged offense.

        Trial court did not err by allowing defendant to be convicted with fewer than 12 jurors finding him guilty because the trial court's use of the term "consensus" in an instruction did not violate the verdict unanimity requirement, as the trial judge twice repeated that the jury had to unanimously agree on a verdict.

        Trial court's disjunctive instruction on the charge of felony operation of a motor vehicle to elude arrest was not improper; while many of the enumerated aggravating factors are in fact separate crimes under various provisions of the general statutes, they are not separate offenses, but are merely alternate ways of enhancing the punishment for speeding to elude arrest from a misdemeanor to a class H felony.

        Defendant failed to show any plain error in the trial court's instructions to the jury, which charged that defendant was guilty if the jury found that he sold between 10 and 50 pounds of marijuana, because the State provided evidence that the weight of the marijuana involved in a police informant's transactions with defendant was 11 pounds and 13 pounds; the State provided evidence that the weight of the marijuana involved in a police informant's transactions with defendant was 11 pounds and 13 pounds, and because the jury was not presented with any evidence that the weight of marijuana involved was exactly 10 pounds, it was not probable that the instructional error had an impact on the jury's verdicts. State v. Charles, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. App.</cite> 500, 669 S.E.2d 859 (2008), cert. denied, writ dism'd, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 658</cite>, 685 S.E.2d 511 (2009).

        Court of appeals erred in vacating defendant's conviction for first-degree kidnapping because the trial court's disjunctive jury instruction did not violate defendant's constitutional right to be convicted only by the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court; it is not necessary for the State to prove, nor for the jury to find, that defendant committed a particular act other than that of confining, restraining, or removing the victim, and beyond that, defendant's intent or purpose is the focus. State v. Walters, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 749</cite>, 782 S.E.2d 505 (2016).
       </p>

        Trial court's jury instructions did not deny defendant his constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict because he did not object at trial, the jury was provided with separate verdict sheets for each charge, the record did not reflect any confusion regarding the jurors' duty in the trial, and the jury was instructed on unanimity.

    §

   24 by giving instructions to the foreperson that it did not give to the rest of the jury because the error was preserved for appeal, notwithstanding defendant's failure to object, when the trial court's instructions to a single juror violated defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict, and the trial court gave the foreperson instructions during its recorded and unrecorded conversations that it did not provide to the rest of the jury in violation of defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict; the State failed to show that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the trial court instructed only the foreperson that the jurors needed to resolve the issue in the jury room, and its failure to similarly instruct the remaining jurors could have given them the impression that it had resolved the matter, foreclosing further debate during deliberations.

   24, the error is deemed preserved for appeal notwithstanding the defendant's failure to object because the right to a unanimous jury verdict is fundamental to the system of justice; while N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Poll Jury.
   
   - The defendant was entitled as a matter of right to know whether each juror assented to the verdict, announced by the juror who undertook to answer for the jury, and to that end he had the right to insist that a specific question be addressed to and answered by each juror in open court, as to whether he assented to said verdict. State v. Boger, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 702</cite>, 163 S.E. 877 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        When requested in apt time, a party is entitled to have the jury polled; that is, to have an inquiry directed to each juror in order to ascertain his assent to the announced verdict. When the jury is so polled and the verdict is challenged, the record must affirmatively establish that each juror assented to the verdict entered. State v. Dow, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 644</cite>, 99 S.E.2d 860 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        When requested in apt time, both defendant and the prosecuting attorney for the State have a legal right to demand that the jury be polled. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to have the jury polled is surely one of the best safeguards for the protection of the accused, and as an incident to jury trials would seem to be a constitutional right, and its exercise only a mode, more satisfactory to the prisoner, of ascertaining the fact that it is the verdict of the whole jury. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968); State v. Ingland, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 42</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 577 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant has a constitutional right, upon timely request, to have the jury polled as a corollary to his right to a unanimous verdict. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to a poll of the jury in criminal actions is firmly established by this section and by statute. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 191</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 398 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Polling of Jury Described.
   
   - The polling of the jury is a procedure whereby the jurors are asked individually the finding they have arrived at. The practice requires each juror to answer for himself, thus creating an individual response. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A criminal defendant's right to have the jury polled is the right to have questions propounded to the jurors, individually, concerning whether each juror assented and still assents to the verdict tendered to the court. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The predominant purpose of the poll
   
   is to ascertain if the verdict as tendered by the jury is the unanimous verdict of a jury in open court, as prescribed by this section. Lipscomb v. Cox, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 502</cite>, 142 S.E. 779 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The object of the jury poll is to give each juror an opportunity, before the verdict is recorded, to declare in open court his assent to the verdict which the foreman has returned, and thus to enable the court and the parties to ascertain with certainty that a unanimous verdict has been in fact reached and that no juror has been coerced or induced to agree to a verdict to which he has not fully assented. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968); State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 300 S.E.2d 861 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        By having the jury polled, a defendant can ascertain if there has been any misunderstanding of the requirement of unanimity by any juror. State v. Ingland, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 42</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 577 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rationale behind requiring that any polling of the jury be before dispersal is to ensure that nothing extraneous to the jury's deliberations can cause any of the jurors to change their minds. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 191</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 398 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of polling the jury is to ensure that the jurors unanimously agree with and consent to the verdict at the time it is rendered. State v. Black, <cite class="nc_code">328 N.C. 191</cite>, 400 S.E.2d 398 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only two questions are necessary
   
   to elicit whether the juror assented in the jury room and still assents in open court to the jury verdict. The first is: "Was this your verdict?" The addition of the second question "Is this now your verdict?" relates to the same time period addressed in the third question, "Do you still agree and assent thereto?" The second and third questions refer to the present in-court state of mind of the juror and serve only to emphasize by repetition that the crucial assent is the juror's assent to the verdict when he returns to the courtroom. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of Juror to Dissent.
   
   - When the verdict has been received from the foreman and has been entered, it is the duty of the clerk to cause the jury to hearken to their verdict as the court has it recorded, and to read it to them and say: "So say you all?" At this time any juror may retract on the ground of conscientious scruples, mistake, fraud, or otherwise, and his dissent would then be effectual. Davis v. State, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 533</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 697 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any juror may dissent from a verdict to which he has agreed in the jury room at any time before it is received and entered up. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Verdict Not Defective Where Juror Eventually Freely Assents.
   
   - A jury verdict is not defective if it appears that a juror eventually freely assented to the verdict. State v. Asbury, <cite class="nc_code">291 N.C. 164</cite>, 229 S.E.2d 175 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Coercion of Unanimous Verdict.
   
   - Jury could have reasonably concluded that it was required to deliberate until it reached a unanimous verdict, which was a violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIa73s15A-1235ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1235(c)</a></cite> and N.C. Const., Art. I,

        Jury's Free Accession to Verdict.
   
   - A verdict is not defective if a juror understood that he or she has a right to dissent and eventually freely assented to the verdict. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C. App.</cite> 522, 300 S.E.2d 861 (1983).

       <p>
        Trial court did not coerce the jury's verdict by instructing the deadlocked jury on acting in concert, an instruction that should have originally been included, or inquiring into the numerical division of the jury's deadlock, as the court did not address whether the majority favored conviction. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. App.</cite> 318, 648 S.E.2d 896, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 704</cite>, 653 S.E.2d 878 (2007), appeal dismissed, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 372</cite>, 664 S.E.2d 560 (2008).

        Charge on Unanimity Not Required in Absence of Request.

        Omission of Charge Held Harmless.

        No Violation of Right to Unanimous Verdict.
   
   - When a criminal jury indicated it was having difficulty reaching a verdict, the trial court's request that the jury reveal the numerical split of its vote was not a per se violation of defendant's right to a unanimous verdict, under N.C. Const., Art. I,

       <p>
        There was no risk of a lack of unanimity where defendant was charged with and convicted of the same number of offenses, and the evidence supported that number of offenses, and using the same underlying act to support convictions for both first-degree sexual offense and indecent liberties did not violate defendant's constitutional protection against double jeopardy; where the instructions told jury that it must "agree unanimously" on particular sex offenses and limited consideration of first-degree sexual offenses to the approximate dates on which they were alleged to have occurred and to a specific act, and dates and acts corresponded with the evidence, the instructions were proper and there was no lack of unanimity. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 686, 615 S.E.2d 360 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">360 N.C. 484</cite>, 632 S.E.2d 493 (2006).

       <p>
        Defendant was found guilty by a unanimous jury where the trial judge was clear in the jury instructions that specific incident corresponded to a particular charge and that the jury must be unanimous in reaching a verdict on each charge. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. App.</cite> 86, 636 S.E.2d 267 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the State presented sufficient evidence to support the elements of each crime charged, defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury was not violated despite defendant's contention that neither the jury instructions nor the verdict sheets required the jury to unanimously agree on the specific acts defendant committed to support each verdict. State v. Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">179 N.C. App.</cite> 710, 635 S.E.2d 455 (2006), cert. denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 436</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 896 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sXIa39s14-316.1" target="_blank">G.S. 14-316.1</a></cite>, a jury did not have to unanimously agree as to the act that defendant encouraged or assisted the minor involved in the crime to commit, for which the juvenile could be adjudicated a delinquent, as long as it agreed that he encouraged or assisted the juvenile in the performance of such an act, because a conviction properly resulted from producing, promoting or contributing to any condition of delinquency, and the crime's gravamen was defendant's conduct, rather than that of the juvenile. State v. Cousart, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 150, 641 S.E.2d 372 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions for felonious sexual act with a minor under the age of 13 and indecent liberties were erroneously reversed on the theory that it could not be said that the jury unanimously found defendant committed the same specific act to support each conviction because, while different jurors might have found defendant committed different acts of misconduct, as the evidence showed more acts of misconduct than defendant was charged with, the jury unanimously agreed that sexual misconduct occurred; thus, defendant's right to a unanimous verdict was not violated. State v. Massey, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 406</cite>, 646 S.E.2d 362 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court did not give any disjunctive instruction and, in any event, the unanimity cases relied upon by defendant did not apply to a charge of conspiracy to traffic in cocaine, the trial court's instruction did not create a risk of a non-unanimous verdict. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. App.</cite> 735, 656 S.E.2d 632, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 364</cite>, 664 S.E.2d 313 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court determined that a juror, who had discussed the case with another juror in a bathroom attached to the juror room, had not been intimidated or received outside information and was in agreement with the verdict reached by the jury, and no conversations had occurred outside the jury room, at most, the record established that the two jurors may have discussed the case between themselves; thus, there was no violation of the unanimity requirement. State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. App.</cite> 747, 659 S.E.2d 73 (2008), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 512</cite>, 668 S.E.2d 564 (2008), cert. denied, 555 U.S. 1215, 129 S. Ct. 1532, 173 L.

        Trial court's instructions allowed a jury to find defendant guilty of felony murder if it found he committed either robbery with a dangerous weapon of the store owners or robbery with a dangerous weapon of a customer. Because either of these alternative acts established an element of felony murder - namely, the commission of one of the several felonies enumerated in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sIIIa06s14-17" target="_blank">G.S. 14-17</a></cite> - the N.C.

Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 514</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 239 (2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 851, 130 S. Ct. 129, 175 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juror misconduct consisting of a juror's conversation about jury deliberations with a trial spectator that occurred after the jury's guilty verdict of murder but prior to sentencing was not grounds for a mistrial because there was no evidence that the jurors improperly discussed the case before the verdict; hence, defendant did not demonstrate prejudice as to the jury's determination of his guilt under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Xa62s15A-1061" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1061</a></cite>.

        In defendant's trial on charges of taking indecent liberties with a child, defendant's constitutional right to a unanimous jury verdict, N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24, was not violated by the trial court's jury instructions and the verdict sheets because the trial court's instructions explicitly distinguished among the five indecent liberties charges and directed the jurors to find defendant guilty on each count only if they determined that defendant had committed the requisite acts within the designated time periods, which were set forth in the indictments, and, as the court informed the jurors in its instructions, each verdict sheet was paired with a particular indictment as indicated in the top right-hand corner of the verdict sheet State v. Comeaux, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. App.</cite> 595, 741 S.E.2d 346 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because each of the alternative acts alleged to support defendant's failure to register as a sex offender satisfied the third element of the jury instruction, that defendant changed his address and failed to notify the sheriff in the requisite time period, the requirement of jury unanimity was satisfied. State v. Crockett, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 96, 767 S.E.2d 78 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury was not presented with either an expressly or functionally disjunctive instruction on the charge of discharging a firearm into occupied property because the defendant was indicted for firing only into the home of the victim; at trial, the State presented evidence only suggesting that the home that was fired into was the victim's home; and the victim testified at length about the bullet holes and damage done to her home; thus, the defendant was not denied his right to a unanimous jury verdict. State v. Charleston, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. App.</cite> 671, 789 S.E.2d 513 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's arguments regarding jury unanimity lacked merit, as the jury instructions and the verdict sheets distinguished between the three sets of charges based upon the different locations where the offenses allegedly occurred and the State presented evidence of sexual offenses in each of the locations identified. State v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 337, 801 S.E.2d 123 (2017).

State v. Orellana, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. App.</cite> 110, 817 S.E.2d 480 (2018).

        Insufficient Evidence Regarding Jurors Praying.
   
   - There was insufficient evidence to show the asserted ground for relief as defendant maintained in his motion for appropriate relief under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1420" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1420</a></cite> that two jurors had prayed together outside the jury room in his death penalty case.

       <p>
        Waiver of Right to Jury Trial.
   
   - Because defendant was arraigned before the effective date of the constitutional amendment permitting waiver of the right to a trial by jury, defendant was not constitutionally permitted to waive defendant's right to a trial by jury. Accordingly, because the fact-finder was improperly constituted, in that it consisted of a single trial judge rather than twelve unanimous jurors, automatic reversal and remand for a new trial, before a jury, was required.

        The right to trial by jury carries with it
   
   the right to be tried before a body selected in such a manner that competing and divergent interests and perspectives in the community are reflected rather than reproduced absolutely. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).

        Juror May Still Serve If Juror Can Lay Aside Opinion.
   
   - Notwithstanding a juror's opinion as to how a case should be decided, a juror may still serve if the court determines that the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court. State v. Mebane, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. App.</cite> 516, 418 S.E.2d 245, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">332 N.C. 670</cite>, 424 S.E.2d 414 (1992).

       </p>
       <p>
        Systematic Exclusion of Members of Defendant's Race from Grand Jury Requires Quashing of Indictment.
   
   - This section of the Constitution requires the sustaining of a motion to quash an indictment of a defendant who proves that the members of his race have been systematically excluded from the juries of the county in which he has been indicted. State v. Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 784</cite>, 42 S.E. 814 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19 are to be so interpreted and that systematic exclusion from the grand jury of persons, otherwise qualified, because of their race, requires, upon motion duly made, the quashing of an indictment returned against a member of that race by such grand jury, irrespective of the fact that all members of the grand jury were, themselves, qualified jurors. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion of Class of Persons from Jury Service Will Not Always Invalidate Indictment.
   
   - Even the complete exclusion, by State law, of a group or class of persons from eligibility for jury service will not make invalid an indictment by a grand jury, selected in accordance with such State law, so long as there is no reasonable basis for the conclusion that the ineligible group or class would bring to the deliberations of the jury a point of view not otherwise represented upon it, at least where the defendant is not a member of the excluded group. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Petit juries must be drawn from a source fairly representative of the community;
   
   however, petit juries actually chosen need not mirror the community nor reflect the various distinctive groups in the population. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statistics of Underrepresentation.
   
   - Statistics concerning one jury pool, standing alone, are insufficient to show that underrepresentation of the defendant's race is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).

       <p>
        A jury venire of only 8.3% African-Americans, where the census for the county revealed that African-Americans comprised 16.15% of the county's population, did not encroach on the defendant's constitutional right to be tried by a jury of his or her peers, where he did not allege systematic exclusion, only that the court should have taken affirmative steps to ensure that the jury venire called for his trial was racially proportionate; a 7.85% difference, standing alone, did not render the jury venire constitutionally infirm. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 287</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 799 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1117, 121 S. Ct. 868, 148 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Showing Disproportionate Racial Representation.
   
   - To establish a prima facie case of disproportionate representation of a defendant's race in a jury venire, a defendant must show: (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a "distinctive" group in the community; (2) that the group representation in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of Racial Exclusion Held Insufficient.
   
   - Mere statement in defendant's brief that the systematic maneuverings of the prosecutor excluded persons of defendant's race from the jury, which was not supported by the record, failed to show that members of defendant's race were systematically or arbitrarily excluded from the jury panel. State v. Waddell, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 19</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 293 (1975), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 904, 96 S. Ct. 3211, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1210 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant failed to make a prima facie case of racially motivated peremptory challenges, where the State was willing to accept 40% of the blacks tendered. State v. Abbott, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 475</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 365 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant found guilty of murder and robbery failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the State's use of its peremptory challenges where the State's questions during voir dire focused on the prospective juror's feelings about capital punishment and the age of the juror, or his or her children, as compared with defendant's age; the venire persons were brought into the courtroom individually, so neither defendant nor the State knew how many black citizens were present in the venire or whether a black citizen would be examined next, and three of the first four jurors seated were black, as were both defendant and the victim, thus diminishing the likelihood that racial issues were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A small sample of 40 jurors from the master list of jurors of a county alone was insufficient to establish a systematic exclusion of blacks from the jury pool. State v. McNeill, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 712</cite>, 392 S.E.2d 78 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of a jury box containing only the names of property owners
   
   was not per se discriminatory and did not unfairly narrow the choice of jurors so as to impinge on defendant's statutory or constitutional rights. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusion of Age Group from Jury List.
   
   - The absence from the jury list of the names of persons between the ages of 18 and 21 during the period from July, 1971, the effective date of the amendment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.009.html#t09a01s9-3" target="_blank">G.S. 9-3</a></cite> lowering the age requirement for jurors from 21 years to 18 years, and September, 1971, the date of defendants' trial, was not unreasonable and did not constitute systematic exclusion of this age group from jury service. State v. Cornell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 20</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 768 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of defendant in a criminal prosecution to exhaust his peremptory challenges
   
   does not affect his right to attack an illegally constituted jury. State v. Emery, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 581</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 858 (1944).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The erroneous allowance of an improper challenge for cause
   
   does not entitle the adverse party to a new trial, so long as only those who are competent and qualified to serve are actually empaneled upon the jury which tried his case. State v. Bernard, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 321</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 327 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Challenge of Jurors for Opposition to Death Penalty.
   
   - In a first degree murder prosecution, the trial court properly sustained the State's challenge for cause to each juror who stated that in no event and under no circumstances could he render a verdict of guilty against any person, regardless of the evidence, if the punishment was death. State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 681</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 481 (1970), death penalty vacated, 408 U.S. 937, 92 S. Ct. 2863, 33 L. Ed. 2d 755 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to exclusion of jurors who voiced objections to death penalty, see also, State v. Bernard, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 321</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 327 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Death qualification of jurors does not violate this Article. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 404</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 329 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Death qualifying" juries in capital cases violates neither the United States Constitution nor the North Carolina Constitution. State v. Strickland, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 31</cite>, 361 S.E.2d 882 (1987).

       <p>
        Right to Reject Prejudiced Jurors.
   
   - When no systematic exclusion is shown, defendant's right is only to reject a juror prejudiced against him; he has no right to select one prejudiced in his favor. State v. Bernard, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 321</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 327 (1975).

         The presence on the jury of a judge
        </b>
        who had earlier presided over the defendant's arraignment, granted the defendant time to file motions and initiate discovery, and set the case for trial, violated the defendant's right to trial by a jury of 12, a right which is inalienable in North Carolina, and denied him liberty without due process of law, and the fact that neither party challenged the judge's presence on the jury was irrelevant. Cox v. Turlington, 648 F. Supp. 1553 (E.D.N.C. 1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's constitutional right to an impartial jury was violated as a magistrate served on defendant's jury while having personal knowledge of defendant's prior drug charges and after having direct pretrial involvement with the charges for which the magistrate participated in deciding defendant's guilt or innocence. State v. Neal, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. App.</cite> 100, 674 S.E.2d 713 (2009).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal Access to Criminal Records of Jurors.
   
   - An indigent defendant's lack of access to the Police Information Network (PIN) did not deny the defendant equal access to information in violation of this section of the North Carolina Constitution, where the court suggested alternative means to obtaining such information on jurors and the defendant's counsel did not subsequently object to the trial court's action or move for funds with which the defense could run its own criminal record checks. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 531</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 773 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 949, 121 S. Ct. 1419, 149 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Impartial Jury.
   
   - Trial court's conduct at a suppression hearing in asking a police officer an additional question regarding the officer's investigative stop of defendant in a case where defendant was charged with and pled guilty to habitual driving while impaired did not violate defendant's right to trial by a jury; the question did not show that the trial court was partial to the State's case, but, instead, showed that the trial court was trying to understand the "whole picture on what happened," even if the question was outside the scope of what was appropriate for such a hearing. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 405, 651 S.E.2d 589 (2007), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 341</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 733 (2008).

         IV. PETTY MISDEMEANORS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose.
   
   - The purpose of conferring on the legislature power to provide means of trial other than by jury for petty misdemeanors is to avoid the inconvenience, expense and delay attendant upon indictment by the grand jury and the trial by the jury where the parties choose to waive it, in the ordinary course of criminal procedure. State v. Crook, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. 536</cite> (1884). See also, State v. Boykin, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 407</cite>, 191 S.E. 18 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment by grand jury is dispensed with
   
   in the trial of petty misdemeanors under this section. State v. Lytle, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 738</cite>, 51 S.E. 66 (1905).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature May Provide Other Means of Trial.
   
   - The legislature has power to designate the unlawful possession and transportation of intoxicants a petty misdemeanor and to provide means of trial for the offense other than by indictment and trial by jury. State v. Shine, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 237</cite>, 22 S.E.2d 447 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of this section empower the legislature to provide means other than petit juries for the trial of petty misdemeanors, with the right of appeal. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952); State v. Underwood, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 68</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 461 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In Inferior Courts.
   
   - It is permissible under this section for the General Assembly to provide for the trial of petty misdemeanors in inferior courts with the right of appeal to the superior court. State v. Lytle, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 738</cite>, 51 S.E. 66 (1905); State v. Brittain, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 668</cite>, 57 S.E. 352 (1907); State v. Hyman, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 411</cite>, 79 S.E. 284 (1913); State v. Tate, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 373</cite>, 85 S.E. 383 (1915); State v. Pasley, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 695</cite>, 104 S.E. 533 (1920); State v. Camby, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 50</cite>, 182 S.E. 715 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        With Jury Trial De Novo on Appeal.
   
   - The only exception to the rule that nothing can be a conviction but the verdict of a jury is the constitutional authority granted the General Assembly to provide for the initial trial of misdemeanors in inferior courts without a jury, with trial de novo by a jury upon appeal. State v. Hudson, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 74</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 189 (1971), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1160, 94 S. Ct. 920, 39 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional right of a defendant charged with a misdemeanor to have a jury trial is not infringed
   
   by the fact that he has first to submit to trial without a jury in the district court and then appeal to superior court in order to obtain a jury trial. State v. Sherron, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 386, 166 S.E.2d 836 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Jury Trial Is Preserved by Requirement of Trial De Novo on Appeal.
   
   - The right of a trial by jury in a criminal action is preserved to the accused by the statutory requirement of a trial de novo in the superior court on appeal from a court of subordinate jurisdiction, and conviction in the superior court cannot be had unless upon the verdict of the jury, in accordance with the provisions of this section of the Constitution. State v. Pulliam, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 681</cite>, 114 S.E. 394 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional guaranty of a jury trial is met by the right of appeal
   
   which is given from an inferior court, in all cases, to the superior court. State v. Lytle, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 738</cite>, 51 S.E. 66 (1905). See also, State v. Hyman, <cite class="nc_code">164 N.C. 411</cite>, 79 S.E. 284 (1913).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Trials May Be Abolished in Inferior Courts.
   
   - Where defendants have the right to appeal to the superior court and obtain a trial de novo before a petit jury, the General Assembly may abolish jury trials in an inferior court by a direct enactment to that effect without transgressing this section. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 205</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 602 (1953).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Right of Appeal.
   
   - A person on trial for a misdemeanor in an inferior court with right of appeal to the superior court may waive his constitutional right to a trial by jury by consenting to the judgment therein entered, or by not appealing therefrom, and the fact that afterwards he employs an attorney and moves for appeal within the time allowed by the applicable statute will not affect the fact that he had personally acquiesced in the judgment entered. State v. Lakey, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. 571</cite>, 132 S.E. 570 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in a prosecution in the recorder's court for wilful failure to support his illegitimate child, defendant complied with the terms of the suspended judgment by making two payments according to its terms, paying the costs of court, and executing a compliance bond pursuant to the terms of the judgment, he would be deemed to have knowingly and intelligently waived his statutory right to appeal to the superior court. State v. Cooke, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 201</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 226 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate Court May Increase Punishment in Trial De Novo.
   
   - Upon appeal from an inferior court for a trial de novo in the superior court, the superior court may impose punishment in excess of that imposed in the inferior court provided the punishment imposed does not exceed the statutory maximum. State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 111</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 789 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Transfer of Untried Misdemeanors.
   
   - For case holding that statutes purporting to authorize the transfer of untried misdemeanor cases from an inferior court to the superior court and the initial trial of such transferred cases in the superior court upon the warrant of the inferior court repugnant to the declaration inherent in the second sentence of this section, that a person charged with the commission of a misdemeanor cannot be put on trial in the superior court upon the warrant of an inferior court unless he has been tried upon such warrant in the inferior court and has appealed from that court to the superior court, see State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 454</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 283 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Assault and battery is not a petty misdemeanor
   
   within the proviso to this section. State v. Stewart, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 563</cite> (1883); Schick v. United States, 195 U.S. 65, 24 S. Ct. 826, 49 L. Ed. 99 (1904).

        This Section Applicable to Actions Respecting Property Only.
   
   - Though this section contains no such qualifications, it has been construed to apply only to actions respecting property in which the right to a jury trial existed either at common law, or by statute before the 1868 Constitution became operative; for actions created since then, the right to a jury trial depends upon statutory authority. State ex rel. Rhodes v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">91 N.C. App.</cite> 517, 372 S.E.2d 312 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 514</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 329 (1989).

       <p>
        Cap on Punitive Damages.
   
   - Section 1D-25, which places a cap on punitive damages, does not violate injured parties' rights to a jury trial, because their right to punitive damages is not a property interest, and they only have a right to a civil jury trial concerning property. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. App.</cite> 672, 562 S.E.2d 82 (2002), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).

       <p>
        Although N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 appears to embody a broad definition of the term "property," a controversy in which punitive damages are assessed is not one which enforces a plaintiff's legal rights and, therefore, does not respect property; thus, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001D.html#t1Ds1D-25" target="_blank">G.S. 1D-25</a></cite> in no way infringes upon plaintiffs' right to a trial by jury under N.C.

   13 merely establishes the form and procedure for the trial of all civil actions, including the procedure of having issues of fact decided by a jury in what were formerly equity proceedings; to determine whether there exists a constitutional right to trial by jury of a particular cause of action, one looks to this section, which ensures that there is a right to trial by jury where the underlying cause of action existed at the time of adoption of the 1868 Constitution, regardless of whether the action was formerly a proceeding in equity. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).

        "Jury".
   
   - The word "jury" is to be given the signification which it had when the Constitution was adopted, i.e., a body of 12 men in a court of justice duly selected and impaneled in the case to be tried. State v. Emery, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 581</cite>, 31 S.E.2d 858 (1944), decided prior to the 1946 amendment to Art. I,

       <p>
        "Trial".
   
   - The word "trial" refers to a dispute and issue of fact, and the expression "trial by jury," as used in this section, does not necessarily signify that every legal controversy is to be determined by a jury. Board of County Comm'rs v. George, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 414</cite>, 109 S.E. 77 (1921).

        The ancient mode of trial by jury has been preserved

       <p>
        History teaches that a jury can best settle factual controversies,

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to Jury Trial Is Guaranteed.
   
   - The Constitution of North Carolina guarantees to every litigant the sacred and inviolable right to demand a trial by jury of the issues of fact arising in all controversies respecting property, and he cannot be deprived of this right except by his own consent. Scott Poultry Co. v. Bryan Oil Co., <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 16</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 693 (1967); Mathias v. Brumsey, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 558, 219 S.E.2d 646 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 140</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 798 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section guarantees to every person the "sacred and inviolable" right to demand a jury trial of issues of fact arising in all controversies at law respecting property. Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has been construed to guarantee trial by jury in all civil actions where the parties have not waived the right. Cutts v. Casey, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 390</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 297 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Applies in Certain Cases.
   
   - This constitutional provision applies only to cases in which the prerogative existed at common law or by statute at the time the Constitution of 1868 was adopted. Chowan &amp; S.R.R. v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">105 N.C. 246</cite>, 11 S.E. 328 (1890); Groves v. Ware, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 553</cite>, 109 S.E. 568 (1921); Belk's Dep't Store, Inc. v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 441</cite>, 23 S.E.2d 897 (1943); Kaperonis v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 587</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 464 (1963); In re Estate of Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 204</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 922 (1966); In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C.

       </p>
       <p>
        The right to a trial by jury as provided in this section applies only to cases in which the prerogative existed at common law or was procured by statute at the time the Constitution was adopted, and not to those in which the right and the remedy are thereafter created by statute. Thus, this section cannot be invoked to deprive a public official of the discretion with which he is clothed by legislative enactment. Groves v. Ware, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 553</cite>, 109 S.E. 568 (1921); McInnish v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 494</cite>, 122 S.E. 182 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to trial by jury as provided for by this section applies only to cases in which the prerogative existed at common law or was procured by statute at the time the Constitution was adopted. The right does not apply to cases in which a right and remedy were thereafter created by statute. State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 405 S.E.2d 351 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The relevant date for determining the scope of the constitutional right to jury trial
   
   in civil cases is the date of adoption of the 1868 Constitution. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982); State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 405 S.E.2d 351 (1991).

        Right Not Absolute.
   
   - Constitutional right to a jury trial preserved in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 53(b)(2) was not absolute, as the right was premised upon a preliminary determination by the trial judge that there indeed existed genuine issues of fact and credibility which required submission to the jury, and, in certain cases, credibility was manifest as a matter of law, but no general rule could be stated to determine whether credibility was manifest in a particular case. Dockery v. Hocutt, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 210</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 431 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying the one child's request for a jury trial on the one child's motion for sanctions against the second child and wife regarding the counterclaim that they filed; the motion for sanctions was not an action regarding a property right, and thus the one child did not have a constitutional right to a jury, and in any event the evidence did not support the entry of sanctions. Hill v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 69, 638 S.E.2d 601, appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 427</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 502 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving a promissory note release, a home buyer unsuccessfully argued that the trial court erred by directing a verdict in favor of an estate administrator on the issue of whether the release was supported by consideration when the administrator had the burden of proof on that issue at trial and that his constitutional right under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 to a jury trial was violated because, by granting the administrator's motion for a directed verdict at the close of the administrator's evidence, the trial court usurped the jury's responsibility by preventing him from presenting evidence and calling witnesses. The right to a jury trial was not absolute, and because the administrator established his claim through documentary evidence, which the parties stipulated was authentic and correct, the trial court properly directed the verdict in favor of the administrator despite the administrator having the burden of proof at trial. Burton v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 81, 689 S.E.2d 174 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Granting a buyer summary judgment that the buyer owned certain real property did not violate a creditor's manager's jury trial right because (1) that right was subject to a determination that there was a genuine issue of fact to be decided at a trial, and (2) no such issue existed. Sullivan v. Pugh, <cite class="nc_code">258 N.C. App.</cite> 691, 814 S.E.2d 117 (2018), cert. denied, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 2387, 203 L. Ed. 2d 682 (U.S. 2019).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Applies Only in Cases Involving Fact Issues.
   
   - This section does not confer the right to demand the intervention of a jury absolutely and unqualifiedly, but only in cases involving issues of fact. McQueen v. Peoples Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. 509</cite>, 16 S.E. 270 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional right to trial by jury is not absolute; rather, it is premised upon a preliminary determination by the trial judge that there indeed exist genuine issues of fact and credibility which require submission to the jury. Therefore, the right to jury trial is not an impediment to directing a verdict for that party with the burden of proof where the credibility of the movant's evidence is manifest as a matter of law. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Burnette, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 524</cite>, 256 S.E.2d 388 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In Actions Where Legal Rights Are Involved.
   
   - The right to trial by jury applies exclusively to actions in which legal rights are involved. State ex rel. Utilities Comm'n v. Great S. Trucking Co., <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 687</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 201 (1943) (concurring opinion).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The credibility of testimony is for the jury,
   
   not the court, and a genuine issue of fact must be tried by a jury unless this right is waived. Cutts v. Casey, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 390</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 297 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment may not be granted in favor of the party having the burden of proof when his right to recover depends upon the credibility of his witnesses. Shearin v. National Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 88, 218 S.E.2d 207 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Trial Not Required at Each Stage of Proceedings.
   
   - This section, guaranteeing the right of trial by jury in "controversies at law respecting property," includes equitable and legal elements involved in the determination of the issues made by the pleadings, but it is not required that a trial by jury be had at each stage of the proceedings when this right has elsewhere therein been properly safeguarded by statute. Board of County Comm'rs v. George, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 414</cite>, 109 S.E. 77 (1921).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Court May Not Determine Fact Issues.
   
   - Right to a jury trial is guaranteed by this section, and where the parties do not consent to trial by the court, the court may not determine, prior to the introduction of evidence, an issue of fact joined by the pleadings. Hershey Corp. v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 122</cite>, 176 S.E. 265 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error for the trial court to determine issues of fact raised by the pleadings in the absence of waiver of the constitutional and statutory right to a trial by jury, there being no question of reference. Sparks v. Sparks, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 492</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 356 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was nothing in the record to indicate that petitioner and respondent had waived their constitutional and statutory right to have issue of fact joined on the pleadings tried by a jury, and there was no question of reference, the judge had no authority to enter an order affirming the order of the assistant clerk of the superior court, which in effect was a determination by the judge of the issue of fact raised by the pleadings and a finding by him that money deposited in the office of the clerk of the superior court was funds belonging to decedent and an order that said money be distributed to the administrator c.t.a. of her last will and testament. In re Estate of Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 204</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 922 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Entering Judgment Without Aid of Jury on Issues of Fact.
   
   - Where the parties to a civil action do not waive trial by jury nor consent that the judge find the facts, it is error for the judge to enter judgment without the aid of the jury on the controverted issues of fact raised by the pleadings. Icenhour v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 434</cite>, 64 S.E.2d 428 (1951).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Judgment of Dismissal Offends Plaintiff's Right to Jury Trial.
   
   - Judgment of dismissal of plaintiff's action offends against plaintiff's constitutional right of jury trial where these factors come into focus: (1) The record discloses no stipulation by which jury trial was waived or consent was given for the court to find facts; (2) the plaintiff's evidence was sufficient to make out a prima facie case in accordance with the allegations of the complaint; (3) the defendant offered no evidence; (4) the plaintiff's evidence does not establish the truth of the defendant's affirmative defense. Ingle v. McCurry, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 65</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 745 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is more than a scintilla of evidence
   
   to sustain the allegations of the complaint, the case must be submitted to the jury, its sufficiency to warrant a verdict for plaintiff being for the determination of the jury, subject only to the discretionary power of the trial court to set the verdict aside in proper cases, and a strict adherence to this rule is necessary to preserve the right of trial by jury guaranteed under this section. Fox v. Asheville Army Store, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 187</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 550 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of Proof Between the Parties.
   
   - The rules of law as to the burden of proof between the parties to litigation respecting damages to property resulting from negligence is one of substantial right guaranteed by the federal Constitution, and more emphatically by this section of the State Constitution. McDowell v. Norfolk S.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 571</cite>, 120 S.E. 205, 42 A.L.R. 857 (1923).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Court to Increase Jury Award by Additur.
   
   - While it may be suggested that the practice of additur deprives a defendant of his constitutional right to a jury trial, guaranteed by this section, the obvious answer is that the defendant may waive that right, which he does when he consents to pay the additur, since in this State the parties to a civil action have a right to waive a jury trial. Caudle v. Swanson, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 249</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 357 (1958).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Compulsory Reference.
   
   - Every litigant has the constitutional right of trial by jury unless he voluntarily waives it, and, in case of a compulsory reference made to facilitate the trial of a cause, he may renew his demand for a jury trial by excepting to the report of the referee and pointing out the findings so excepted to as a basis for issues. State ex rel. Wilson v. Featherstone, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 446</cite>, 27 S.E. 124 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        A compulsory reference, under former G.S. 1-189, did not deprive either party of his constitutional right to a trial by jury of the issues of fact arising on the pleadings, but such trial was only upon the written evidence taken before the referee. Resort Dev. Co. v. Phillips, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 69</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 813 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although when a court orders a compulsory reference, a party preserves his right to trial by complying with the procedural steps outlined in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 53, the party is entitled to trial by jury only if the evidence before the reference was sufficient to raise an issue of fact. Fauchette v. Zimmerman, <cite class="nc_code">79 N.C. App.</cite> 265, 338 S.E.2d 804 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of hearsay evidence does not violate the confrontation clause when declarant is unavailable to testify
   
   and his statement bears adequate indicia of reliability. Thus, in a trial for taking indecent liberties with a four-year-old child, admission of evidence admissible under established exception to the hearsay rule did not violate defendant's right of confrontation under this section. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. App.</cite> 584, 367 S.E.2d 139 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Polling Jury in Civil Actions.
   
   - Under this section, the losing party in a civil action may demand a polling of the jury upon the return of the verdict, as a matter of right. Culbreth v. Borden Mfg. Co., <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 208</cite>, 126 S.E. 419 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon the coming in of the verdict in a civil action, either party to the action has the constitutional right to have the jury polled before accepting the verdict as a unanimous one. In re Will of Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 638</cite>, 140 S.E. 604 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Right to Jury Trial Strictly Construed.
   
   - It is a general rule, since the right of trial by jury is highly favored, that waivers of the right are always strictly construed and are not to be lightly inferred or extended by implication, whether with respect to a civil or criminal case. Mathias v. Brumsey, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 558, 219 S.E.2d 646 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 140</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 798 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver Will Not Be Presumed.
   
   - There can be no presumption of a waiver of trial by jury where such a trial is provided for by law. Thus, in the absence of an express agreement or consent, a waiver of the right to a jury trial will not be presumed or inferred. Indeed, every reasonable presumption should be made against waiver. Mathias v. Brumsey, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 558, 219 S.E.2d 646 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 140</cite>, 220 S.E.2d 798 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        How Jury Trial May Be Waived.
   
   - A party may waive his right to jury trial by (1) failing to appear at the trial, (2) written consent filed with the clerk, (3) oral consent entered in the minutes of the court, (4) failing to demand a jury trial pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 38(b). Sykes v. Belk, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 106</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 439 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver Where Fiduciary Relationship Present.
   
   - Although individuals may waive their right to a civil jury trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 by agreement, any waiver must be examined cautiously, especially in situations in which a fiduciary relationship is present. King v. Bryant, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 340, 737 S.E.2d 802 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no constitutional impediment to arbitration agreements.
   
   Miller v. Two State Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. App.</cite> 412, 455 S.E.2d 678 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An agreement to arbitrate a dispute is not an unenforceable contract requiring waiver of a jury;
   
   thus, the trial court erred in concluding that because arbitration provision did not provide for trial of facts by a jury that it was unconscionable and unenforceable under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.022B.html#t22Ba02s22B-10" target="_blank">G.S. 22B-10</a></cite>, and in violation of N.C.

         Final Rights of Parties Affected.
        </b>
        - Appellants satisfied the test to establish their constitutional right to a trial by jury; genuine issues of fact existed with respect to the issues of whether plaintiff was mentally competent and whether he was unduly influenced, and these issues were in the province of a jury and had to be determined before the ultimate issues of the quiet title action, the declaratory judgment regarding the trust, and the validity of legal instruments could be resolved. Thus, the final rights of the parties were affected. Woody v. Vickrey, - N.C. App.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Party Charged with Maintaining Nuisance Has Right to Jury Trial.
   
   - A party charged with the maintenance of a public nuisance has a right to traverse the factual allegations of the complaint. If he does so, he cannot be deprived of his right to a jury trial on the issues raised by the pleadings. State ex rel. Bowman v. Malloy, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 396</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 796 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Damage Cases.
   
   - In an action for damages for negligently setting fire to plaintiff's woods by sparks from defendant's engine, it was held that this section guaranteed, as a "sacred and inviolable" right, that the plaintiff might have the case submitted to the jury. Williams v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. 623</cite>, 53 S.E. 448 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Arbitration.
   
   - Arbitration judgment was not void as a violation of an injured party's right to jury trial under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001A.html#t1As1A-1" target="_blank">G.S. 1A-1</a></cite>, Rule 38 and 39, N.C. Const., Art. I,

       <p>
        Injunction Action Under CAMA and Dredge and Fill Act.
   
   - Trial court erred in granting defendant's demand for a jury trial in state-initiated proceeding seeking mandatory injunctive relief under Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA) and the Dredge and Fill Act for the removal of fill material on defendant's property; an action such as this neither existed at common law nor by statute at the time of the adoption of the Constitution of 1868; therefore, this section did not apply. State ex rel. Rhodes v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 514</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 329 (1989).

       </p>
       <p>
        The right to a jury trial under the law of this State does not conflict with any of the substantive provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act; therefore, State law would control and plaintiff was entitled to have factual controversy in his action for benefits due under an insurance contract submitted to a jury.

       </p>
       <p>
        Eminent Domain Proceeding Is Not Controversy Concerning Property.
   
   - A proceeding to assess damages for the taking of land by eminent domain is not a controversy concerning property within the meaning of this section. Kaperonis v. North Carolina State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 587</cite>, 133 S.E.2d 464 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Ownership Is Not in Issue in Eminent Domain.
   
   - This section is a constitutional guaranty of jury trial when the issue determinative of the rights of the litigants is: "Who owns the land, plaintiff or defendant?" This issue does not arise when the State, or its agency, exercises the power of eminent domain. The phrase "eminent domain" by definition admits condemnor did not own, but took or appropriated the property of another for a public purpose. Wescott v. State Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 522</cite>, 138 S.E.2d 133 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions Establishing Conditions for Jury Trial in Small Claims Court.
   
   - The provisions of Session Laws 1951, c. 1057, setting up the procedure for adjudicating small claims in the Superior Court of Forsyth County, to the effect that no jury trial shall be had in an action instituted pursuant thereto, unless a demand is made therefor in the manner set out in the act, and the costs advanced and the prosecution bond filed as required therein, were not unreasonable provisions and did not violate this section. Better Home Furn. Co. v. Baron, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 502</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 236 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceedings for Alimony, etc.
   
   - When in proceedings for alimony without divorce the pleadings raise the issues of the validity of marriage between the parties, or whether the husband had separated himself from the wife and failed to provide her suitable or reasonable sustenance, or whether the husband is a drunkard or spendthrift under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-16" target="_blank">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>, the right of trial by jury arises to the defendant, and the case should be transferred by the judge to the civil issue docket for the purpose. Crews v. Crews, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 168</cite>, 95 S.E. 149 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-16" target="_blank">G.S. 50-16</a></cite>, empowering the court to allow subsistence and counsel fees pendente lite to plaintiff in an action for alimony without divorce, did not violate this section. Peele v. Peele, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 298</cite>, 4 S.E.2d 616 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceedings to Terminate Parental Rights.
   
   - The North Carolina constitutional requirement of trial by jury is not applicable to a proceeding for termination of parental rights. In re Ferguson, <cite class="nc_code">50 N.C. App.</cite> 681, 274 S.E.2d 879 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Equitable Distribution Action.
   
   - No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-21" target="_blank">G.S. 50-21</a></cite>, and the language of the statutes themselves create no new right to trial by jury; therefore, there is no right to trial by jury for such an action under the Constitution of North Carolina. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Date of Separation in the Context of Equitable Distribution
   
   - In the context of equitable distribution, defendant does not have a right to jury trial on the issue of the date of separation when he seeks a divorce from bed and board. No such constitutional right exists nor has the legislature statutorily provided for such a right when it drafted the equitable distribution statutes although the date of separation is a jury-triable issue within the absolute divorce context. McCall v. McCall, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. App.</cite> 706, 531 S.E.2d 894 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appraisal.
   
   - Plaintiff 's right under the North Carolina Constitution to trial by jury was not abridged by the appraisal clause. Bentley v. North Carolina Ins. Guar. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 418 S.E.2d 705 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding this provision, the North Carolina Supreme Court has repeatedly approved appraisal as a means of settling the single issue of amount of loss sustained by an insured. Bentley v. North Carolina Ins. Guar. Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 418 S.E.2d 705 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Condemnation.
   
   - Where a matter was called for hearing pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.136.html#t136a09s136-108" target="_blank">G.S. 136-108</a></cite> in a condemnation action with no jury, this hearing did not infringe upon the landowner's right to a jury trial as provided by the North Carolina and United States Constitutions. DOT v. Wolfe, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. App.</cite> 655, 449 S.E.2d 11 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of a co-owner's motion for a jury trial in his appeal from a clerk's order allowing a foreclosure was proper because, inter alia, N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 guaranteed the right to a jury trial only for cases where the right existed when the Constitution of 1868 was adopted, and there was no right to a jury in foreclosure proceedings when the Constitution of 1868 was adopted. In re Foreclosure of Elkins, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 226, 667 S.E.2d 259 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney Disciplinary Proceedings.
   
   - This State has never had a statute which expressly conferred upon an attorney the right to a trial by jury in a judicial disciplinary or disbarment proceeding. Since no such right existed at common law, or by statute at the time the State Constitution was adopted, and is not now provided for by statute, an attorney's motion for a trial by jury is properly denied. In re Northwestern Bonding Co., <cite class="nc_code">16 N.C. App.</cite> 272, 192 S.E.2d 33, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">282 N.C. 426</cite>, 192 S.E.2d 837 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature in 1969 had absolutely no intention of providing a constitutional right to jury trial for attorneys in disciplinary proceedings when it submitted this section to the people. North Carolina State Bar v. DuMont, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 627</cite>, 286 S.E.2d 89 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Jury Trial in Action to Determine Attorneys' Fees Under Quantum Meruit
   
   - Trial court did not err in denying a law firm's request for a jury trial on the reasonable value of the attorneys who had provided legal services for a client under a contingency fee agreement and who were then discharged by the client under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 and N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   13; until adoption of the modern rule, clients had no right to unilaterally discharge an attorney and force him to pursue a quantum meruit claim, and the right to a jury trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 was guaranteed only in cases in which the right and the remedy were in existence when the North Carolina Constitution of 1868 was adopted. Guess v. Parrott, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 585 S.E.2d 464 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Shareholder's Derivative Actions.
   
   - Although a litigant's right to have a jury try issues of fact concerning the merits of the action initiated by the filing of a derivative suit complaint is guaranteed by the Constitution of North Carolina, the procedure required by former G.S. 55-55(c) did not exist before the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, and therefore no State constitutional right exists to a trial by jury of factual issues that might arise during the course of the proceedings required under this section. Alford v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">327 N.C. 526</cite>, 398 S.E.2d 445 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Jury Trial Under Coastal Area Management Act.
   
   - In an action brought by State seeking preliminary injunction to require removal of sign and compliance with Coastal Area Management Act (CAMA), sign company was not entitled to trial by jury since it had not asserted "right and remedy" existing when State Constitution was adopted and since CAMA did not provide statutory right to jury trial. State ex rel. Rhodes v. Givens, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 695, 400 S.E.2d 745 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceedings before the judge to remove a prosecuting attorney from office
   
   for willful misconduct or maladministration in office do not require an issue to be submitted to the jury, as such office is not a property right under the provisions of this section. State ex rel. Hyatt v. Hamme, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 684</cite>, 104 S.E. 174 (1920).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Revocation of Driver's License.
   
   - Since an action to revoke a driver's license is a civil action, jury trial is not necessary. State v. Carlisle, <cite class="nc_code">20 N.C. App.</cite> 358, 201 S.E.2d 704 (1973), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 229</cite>, 204 S.E.2d 15 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.018B.html#t18Ba05s18B-504" target="_blank">G.S. 18B-504</a></cite> does not preserve the right to trial by jury.
   
   State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 405 S.E.2d 351 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-112" target="_blank">G.S. 90-112</a></cite> nor <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-112.1" target="_blank">G.S. 90-112.1</a></cite> creates a right to trial by jury.
   
   State v. Morris, <cite class="nc_code">103 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 405 S.E.2d 351 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An action under G.S.
   
   90-112.1 is in the nature of an action for replevin and is in essence a civil action; as such, the right to a jury trial, if any, is governed by this section of the Constitution, and thus, defendant was not entitled to a trial by jury for her remission action. State v. Honaker, <cite class="nc_code">111 N.C. App.</cite> 216, 431 S.E.2d 869 (1993).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Insanity Proceedings.
   
   - The right to trial by jury did not exist at common law in insanity proceedings and is thus not required under this section. In re Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 642, 215 S.E.2d 789 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxes.
   
   - The right to trial by jury guaranteed by this section does not apply to matters concerned with the administration of the tax laws and the machinery for the collection of taxes, unless the statute affords express authority for this method of determining questions of fact. State ex rel. Unemployment Comp. Comm'n v. J.M. Willis Barber &amp; Beauty Shop, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 709</cite>, 15 S.E.2d 4 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require court review of the valuation of land for taxation, or determination of such value by a jury in a de novo hearing, and will not support resort to certiorari for that purpose. Belk's Dep't Store, Inc. v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 441</cite>, 23 S.E.2d 897 (1943).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination of Boundary Line.
   
   - It was error to find a boundary line without a jury trial because (1) this was a fact issue for a jury, (2) both parties properly demanded a jury trial, and (3) a consent to the appointment of a surveyor did not waive a jury. Ayscue v. Griffin, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 823 S.E.2d 134 (2018).

        Intent of Section.
   
   - This section is intended to protect the integrity of the judicial system, not just the reliability of the conviction obtained in a particular case. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 297</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 622 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does more than protect individuals from unequal treatment; the people of this State have declared in this provision that they will not tolerate the corruption of their juries by racism, sexism, and similar forms of irrational prejudice. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 297</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 622 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to trial by jury carries with it
   
   the right to be tried before a body selected in such a manner that competing and divergent interests and perspectives in the community are reflected rather than reproduced absolutely. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Statistics of Underrepresentation.
   
   - Statistics concerning one jury pool, standing alone, are insufficient to show that underrepresentation of the defendant's race is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        A jury venire of only 8.3% African-Americans, where the census for the county revealed that African-Americans comprised 16.15% of the county's population, did not encroach on the defendant's constitutional right to be tried by a jury of his or her peers, where he did not allege systematic exclusion, only that the court should have taken affirmative steps to ensure that the jury venire called for his trial was racially proportionate; a 7.85% difference, standing alone, did not render the jury venire constitutionally infirm. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 287</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 799 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1117, 121 S. Ct. 868, 148 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prima Facie Showing of Intentional Discrimination.
   
   - As with race-based "Batson" claims, a party alleging gender discrimination must make a prima facie showing of intentional discrimination before the party exercising the preemptory challenge of a juror is required to explain the basis for the strike. State v. Gaines, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 647</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 900, 118 S. Ct. 248, 139 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Case was remanded for a Batson hearing after the trial court erred by concluding that the defendant failed to present a prima facie showing during voir dire to challenge the prosecutor's peremptory strikes of prospective minority jurors, as a numerical analysis of the prosecutor's peremptory strikes, while not conclusive of the issue, called into question the prosecutor's conduct. State v. Barden, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 316</cite>, 572 S.E.2d 108 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To make out a prima facie case of discrimination.
   
   a defendant need only show that the relevant circumstances raise an inference that the prosecutor used peremptory challenges to remove potential jurors solely because of their race. State v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 141</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 186 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court properly denied defendant's Batson challenge based on defendant's failure to make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination; a prima facie case was not made out simply because the juror struck by the peremptory challenge and the defendant were both African-Americans. State v. Lawrence, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 1</cite>, 530 S.E.2d 807 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prima Facie Showing Moot.
   
   - Trial court erred in finding that defendant failed to make out a prima facie showing of discrimination, as the trial court heard the State's reasons for striking the jurors prior to making a ruling on defendant's Batson objection, which made the issue of whether he made a prima facie showing moot; the court then had to consider whether the State met its burden of providing a race-neutral explanation for its peremptory challenges. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 346, 750 S.E.2d 851 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Showing of Disproportionate Racial Representation.
   
   - To establish a prima facie case of disproportionate representation of a defendant's race in a jury venire, a defendant must show: (1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a "distinctive" group in the community; (2) that the group representation in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this under representation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. State v. Bowman, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 459</cite>, 509 S.E.2d 428 (1998), cert. denied, 527 U.S. 1040, 119 S. Ct. 2403, 144 L. Ed. 2d 802 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Peremptory Challenge Test Based on Race Same as Federal Test.
   
   - The test to determine whether peremptory challenges were exercised in a racially discriminatory manner is the same under the North Carolina Constitution as it is under the United States Constitution. State v. Floyd, <cite class="nc_code">343 N.C. 101</cite>, 468 S.E.2d 46, cert. denied, 519 U.S. 896, 117 S. Ct. 241, 136 L. Ed. 2d 170 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Racial Neutrality of Peremptory Strike.
   
   - Whether an explanation for a peremptory strike of a prospective juror being challenged as racially discriminatory is indeed neutral depends on whether, accepting the proffered reason as true, the challenge constitutes purposeful discrimination as a matter of law. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Peremptory Challenges Based on Race Proscribed.
   
   - This section proscribes peremptory challenges to jurors in civil cases as well as criminal cases on the basis of race. Jackson v. Housing Auth., <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 584</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 416 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The State's explanation for using a peremptory strike,
   
   in response to a challenge that it was racially motivated, must be clear, reasonably specific, and related to the particular case to be tried, although it need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).

         II. GRAND JURIES.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The spirit of this section requires that all grand jurors be considered for appointment as grand jury foreman.
   
   State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 452</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 834 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Selection of Grand Jury Foreman Must Meet Racially Neutral Standard.
   
   - A method of selecting a grand jury foreman that meets the racially neutral standard must ensure that all grand jurors are considered by the presiding judge for his selection and that his selection be made on a racially neutral basis. State v. Cofield, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 452</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 834 (1989), holding, however, that this holding applies only to the case at hand and cases in which the indicting grand jury's foreman is selected after the certification date of the opinion of the case at hand.

       <p>
        Racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury foreman

       </p>
       <p>
        A black defendant may make out a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the grand jury foreman's selection by showing either (1) that the selection procedure itself was not racially neutral, or (2) that for a substantial period in the past, relatively few blacks have served in the position of foreman even though a substantial number have been selected to serve as members of grand juries. The State may rebut such a prima facie case on remand by offering evidence that the process used in selecting the grand jury foreman was in fact racially neutral. State v.

        Evidence to Show Pretextual Nature of Prosecutor's Explanation.
   
   - In North Carolina in a claim of racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges, the defendant may put on additional evidence before the trial court's final ruling to prove that the prosecutor's explanations are pretextual. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 1</cite>, 452 S.E.2d 245 (1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 833, 116 S. Ct. 109, 133 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1995), overruled in part, State v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">347 N.C. 309</cite>, 492 S.E.2d 609 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Disparate Treatment of Prospective Jurors Not Dispositive.
   
   - Although the prosecutor claimed to have struck one of the black jurors because of her family's involvement with crime, another because of inconsistent statements and a third because of the juror's views on the death penalty, but, according to defendant, the prosecutor passed two white jurors with criminal backgrounds, one white juror who made inconsistent statements and another who expressed reservations about imposing the death penalty, disparate treatment of prospective jurors was not necessarily dispositive on the issue of discriminatory intent. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">339 N.C. 1</cite>, 452 S.E.2d 245 (1994), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 833, 116 S. Ct. 109, 133 L. Ed. 2d 61 (1995), overruled in part, State v.

   26 of the North Carolina Constitution that none shall be excluded from jury service on account of national origin. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 531</cite>, 532 S.E.2d 773 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 949, 121 S. Ct. 1419, 149 L. Ed. 2d 360 (2001).

        Excuse Based on Age.
   
   - Statutory scheme allowing trial judge to exercise his discretion to excuse jurors over the age of 65 has a rational basis and is not constitutionally infirm. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 420</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 859 (2002).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Circumstances Collectively Showed Discrimination.
   
   - After a black woman was seated for examination during voir dire, the prosecutor asked the clerk if there was a white male out there; the prosecutor briefly questioned the woman and then peremptorily challenged her; the woman was excused and a white man was called for examination and later became the jury foreperson. Standing alone, the prosecutor's peremptory challenge of the black woman would not amount to a prima facie showing of purposeful discrimination. The prosecutor's question of the clerk prior to his examination of the black woman, however, is a relevant circumstance which, when combined with the prosecutor's subsequent peremptory challenge of the black woman, raises an inference of purposeful discrimination on the prosecutor's part thereby establishing a prima facie showing. State v. Hall, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 375, 410 S.E.2d 76 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Race Neutral Reasons for Striking African-American Jurors.
   
   - State's reasons for using six of its peremptory strikes on African-American jurors, including unresponsiveness, deceit, failure to make eye contact, alleged acquaintance with defendant's former girlfriend, an extensive history of purchasing pawn tickets, and prior employment at the convenience store where the incident occurred, were race-neutral. State v. Pender, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. App.</cite> 233, 720 S.E.2d 836 (2012).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutor's Impression that Juror Out of Touch with Reality.
   
   - A peremptory strike of a prospective juror was without racially discriminatory intent where the prosecutor stated that it was based on the prospective juror's limited education, his limited ability to read and write, his failure to answer all questions on the juror questionnaire, his statement that he had never considered his views on the death penalty until that day, and the prosecutor's impression that the juror may be "out of touch with reality." State v. Hardy, <cite class="nc_code">353 N.C. 122</cite>, 540 S.E.2d 334 (2000), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 840, 122 S. Ct. 96, 151 L. Ed. 2d 56 (2001).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Race or Religion of Defendant Different from Excluded Juror.
   
   - Discrimination in selecting juries so strongly taints the judicial system that any proceeding in which it appears is fatally flawed; for this reason, the fact that the defendant's race or religion differs from the excluded person's is irrelevant. State v. Eason, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 730</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 917 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1096, 115 S. Ct. 764, 130 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Challenge Not Pretextual.
   
   - Defendant's proffered reasons for challenging a black juror were not pretextual where the juror had been convicted on six occasions of issuing worthless checks and was not forthright about her convictions upon questioning. State v. Peterson, <cite class="nc_code">344 N.C. 172</cite>, 472 S.E.2d 730 (1996).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Peremptory Challenge by Defendant in Criminal Trial.
   
   - Trial court did not commit clear error in sustaining the State of North Carolina's objection to defendant's peremptory challenges during jury selection, when the State alleged purposeful discrimination on the basis of gender and race. The court considered defendant and the murder victims being black, the credibility of defense counsel, the context of the peremptory strike by defendant against a white prospective juror, and defendant's pretrial motion to prevent the State from exercising peremptory strikes against prospective black jurors. State v. Hurd, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. App.</cite> 281, 784 S.E.2d 528, cert. denied, 792 S.E.2d 521, 2016 N.C. LEXIS 748 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Peremptory Challenges Upheld.
   
   - In a capital case, peremptory challenges to 5 of 6 potential black jurors were upheld where the State met its burden of coming forward with neutral, nonracial explanations for each peremptory challenge. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 1</cite>, 409 S.E.2d 288 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        No purposeful racial discrimination occurred in the peremptory challenges of black jurors where trial court's ruling was supported by the trial court's findings of fact, which were supported by the record. State v. Thomas, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 423</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 141 (1991), cert. denied, 522 U.S. 824, 118 S. Ct. 84, 139 L. Ed. 2d 41 (1997).

        The State did not discriminate on the basis of race in exercising its peremptory challenges against two jurors, where the State provided race-neutral reasons for the peremptory challenges of both jurors, namely that one was young, within the age range of defendants, and had a sister who was also within the age range of defendants, and that the other had been convicted of driving while impaired and had a father with a prior conviction for robbery for which he had served six years, and where, in selecting the 12 jurors and four alternates, the State exercised 27 peremptory challenges, only four of which were against African-Americans. This ratio represented a percentage of African-Americans equivalent to the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool. Moreover, during jury selection, the State made no comments which would support an inference of discrimination. State v. Golphin, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 364</cite>, 533 S.E.2d 168 (2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 931, 121 S. Ct. 1379, 1380, 149 L. Ed. 2d 305 (2001), cert. dismissed, without prejudice, 805 S.E.2d 698, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 900 (2017), cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 587</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 594, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 93 (2018).

        Murder defendant failed to show that jurors were improperly excluded on the basis of race, given one juror's opposition to the death penalty, another juror's potential sympathy for defendant, and a third juror's employment counseling inmates. State v. Fair, <cite class="nc_code">354 N.C. 131</cite>, 552 S.E.2d 568 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Batson challenge to the jury, under principles of racial discrimination, gender discrimination, and racial-gender discrimination combined, were carefully evaluated under the various prongs of Batson and found not to have violated U.S. Const., Amend. VI and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   26, where the trial court found that defendant established a prima facie case that the peremptory challenges were exercised on the basis of race, but thereafter, the prosecutor's reasons were found to be racially neutral; the court found no purposeful discrimination in the challenges made by the prosecutor, and challenges to the other forms of discriminatory challenge lacked merit because there was insufficient proof that a cognizable group had been singled out for exclusion. State v. Wiggins, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 584 S.E.2d 303 (2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 910, 124 S. Ct. 1617, 158 L. Ed. 2d 256 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        State's preemptory challenges, which did not violate Batson because they were race-neutral, were based on potential juror's (1) strong and absolute opposition to death penalty, (2) concern for undue sympathy for the defendant, (3) pregnancy making it difficult to take a life when carrying a life, (4) prison ministry dealing with violent criminals to reform them, (5) rheumatoid arthritis, (6) nervousness about thought of having to impose death penalty, and (7) being homemaker with child with special needs and her sympathies. State v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 1</cite>, 603 S.E.2d 93 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did nor err in denying defendant's Batson challenge to the State's exercising of a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective African-American juror because the State's race neutral explanations for using a peremptory challenge to remove a prospective African-American juror - that her responses on death penalty were weak, that she admitted she might develop sympathy toward defendant, and that she made a misrepresentation on her questionnaire - complied with Batson. State v. Alvarez, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. App.</cite> 487, 608 S.E.2d 371 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to make a prima facie showing of racial discrimination with regard to the State's preemptory challenge of a prospective juror which was granted in defendant's trial for first-degree murder and the trial court, therefore, did not err in overruling defendant's Batson objection because, despite the juror being the first African American to have been challenged, other factors supported the trial court's ruling such as the fact that the victim and the State's three critical witnesses were all African American. Therefore, the case was not particularly susceptible to racial discrimination and the State neither made any racially motivated statements nor asked any racially motivated questions of the prospective juror. State v. Augustine, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 709</cite>, 616 S.E.2d 515 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        State's peremptory challenges to three African-American prospective jurors did not establish a pattern of discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   26, when viewed in conjunction with other relevant facts. When defendant made his Batson objection, the State had accepted two out of five, or forty percent, of eligible African-American jurors; and the State's statements and questions during voir dire appeared evenhanded and not racially motivated. State v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 514</cite>, 669 S.E.2d 239 (2008), cert. denied, 558 U.S. 851, 130 S. Ct. 129, 175 L. Ed. 2d 84 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an appeal as of right with regard to the imposition of a sentence of death against a defendant following a jury trial, which resulted in his conviction for the first-degree murder of a police officer while in the performance of his duties, the defendant's claim of gender bias in the State's peremptory challenge of a prospective juror was not an exceptional circumstance calling for invocation since the defendant had not objected to any of the State's peremptory challenges on the ground of discrimination against women. State v. Maness, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 261</cite>, 677 S.E.2d 796 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action in which defendant appealed his conviction for First-degree murder and his death sentence, the State did not improperly use peremptory challenges to strike prospective African-American jurors on the basis of race where: (1) the numbers did not suggest a systematic effort on the part of the State to prevent African-Americans from serving as jurors; and (2) the State's proffered race-neutral reasons were not pretextual. State v. Waring, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 443</cite>, 701 S.E.2d 615 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings did not indicate that the State acted with racial purpose, and the trial court's ultimate decision to dismiss defendant's Batson objection was upheld. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 346, 750 S.E.2d 851 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's Batson challenge, as when questioned about his thoughts concerning the death penalty, a black juror stated he would not agree with the death penalty under any circumstances, elaborating he was a pastor and agreeing with the death penalty would make him a hypocrite, and that he might hypothetically agree to the death penalty if a defendant chopped someone into pieces and burned them. State v. McQueen, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 790 S.E.2d 897 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Peremptory strike against a second black juror after he minimized his criminal history, avoided questions regarding his family member's criminal charges, had spoken with a witness on multiple occasions and had a great-niece who worked for the witness did not violate Batson. State v. McQueen, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 790 S.E.2d 897 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Peremptory strike against a black female did not violate Batson based on her thought about the death penalty, failure to disclose past criminal charges, her reservations about whether law enforcement treated her brother fairly, and her lack of eye contact when asked whether her brother's prosecution would affect her ability to be fair and impartial to both sides of the case. State v. McQueen, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. App.</cite> 543, 790 S.E.2d 897 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendant did not make a prima facie showing of racially motivated peremptory challenges
   
   where the State accepted seven of the 17 black veniremen tendered and the majority of the jury which tried the defendant was black. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">323 N.C. 208</cite>, 372 S.E.2d 855 (1988), sentence vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 494 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 1463, 108 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1990), in light of, 281 U.S. 700, 50 S. Ct. 353, 74 L. Ed. 1126 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, found guilty of murder and robbery, failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination in the State's use of its peremptory challenges, where the State's questions during voir dire focused on the prospective juror's feelings about capital punishment and the age of the juror, or his or her children, as compared with defendant's age; the venire persons were brought into the courtroom individually, so neither defendant nor the State knew how many black citizens were present in the venire or whether a black citizen would be examined next; and three of the first four jurors seated were black, as were both defendant and the victim, thus diminishing the likelihood that racial issues were inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to establish a prima facie case of purposeful discrimination in selection of the jury where the jury consisted of ten white jurors and two black jurors, the only peremptory challenge exercised by the prosecutor excused a black man from the jury, but the prosecutor also accepted the two women who were the other black members of the jury venire, he accepted one at the same time he challenged the black male juror, indicating that he was not attempting to strike all blacks, and he did not move to strike any jurors for cause, thus, accepting 66% of the black potential jurors. State v. Ross, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 280</cite>, 449 S.E.2d 556 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecutor's peremptory excusal of two of four black jurors in a case involving sexual offenses against a white woman by a black man was not sufficient, standing alone, to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination and require the prosecutor to come forward with race-neutral explanations. State v. Quick, <cite class="nc_code">341 N.C. 141</cite>, 462 S.E.2d 186 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecutor gave race neutral reasons for his peremptory strikes of black jurors in a capital murder case, where one was excused for his criminal record, body language, and lack of candor, and another because she was confused, she did not think that wife-beating was a serious crime, and she had a relative in jail. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the prosecutor's reasons for peremptory strikes of two black females were suspect, in that he initially identified them as two "black" females, the defense failed to object, and the stated reasons that the prospects were health care providers and close to defendant's age were adequate to support the strikes. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 734, 509 S.E.2d 462 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to establish a prima facie case that the State exercised its peremptory challenges in a racially discriminatory manner during the jury selection process where the victims were black, the State's key witnesses were black, the prosecutor made no racially motivated remarks, and the jury was composed of four black males, one black female, three white males, and four white females, with one black male and one black female as alternates. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 251</cite>, 524 S.E.2d 28, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 862, 121 S. Ct. 151, 148 L. Ed. 2d 100 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants did not meet their burden of showing purposeful discrimination in the selection of jurors, due to the racially diverse composition of the jury and the trial court's finding that the prosecution's explanations for striking of prospective jurors because of conduct were not pretextual. State v. Tirado, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 551</cite>, 599 S.E.2d 515 (2004), cert. denied, 544 U.S. 909, 125 S. Ct. 1600, 161 L. Ed. 2d 285 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under U.S. Const., Amend. XIV, as well as N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   26, the State used a peremptory challenge to excuse an African-American prospective juror, however, the State offered race neutral reasons for the excusal, even though other potential jurors may have given similar answers, that she (1) was against killing whether it was legal or illegally and that her opposition was based on religious, moral, and philosophical beliefs she had held since childhood, and (2) had a brother who had previously been convicted of armed robbery; the trial judge was in the best position to resolve this issue, having heard and seen the responses of the prospective juror, including her facial expressions, tone of voice, reactions, and other nuances that were not subject to translation when the appeals court reviewed the cold record on appeal. State v. McClain, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 657, 610 S.E.2d 783 (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's Batson argument regarding jurors stricken by the State failed because he failed to make a prima facie case that the State's challenges were racially motivated, and the court found that the State clearly agreed with the trial court's findings related to the race of the five identified prospective jurors. State v. Bennett, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. App.</cite> 89, 821 S.E.2d 476 (2018).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings as to race neutrality and purposeful discrimination were supported by the record
   
   and the trial court properly overruled defendants' objections to the excusal of six prospective jurors. State v. Gaines, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 647</cite>, 483 S.E.2d 396, cert. denied, 522 U.S. 900, 118 S. Ct. 248, 139 L. Ed. 2d 177 (1997).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings Adhered to Requirements of Inquiry.
   
   - Trial court's findings adhered to the requirements of a Batson inquiry, as the trial court made specific findings as to race, the prevalence of minority jurors being dismissed, and the State's reasoning for its use of peremptory challenges, plus defendant's chance to rebut was also considered. State v. James, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. App.</cite> 346, 750 S.E.2d 851 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court applied the correct criteria
   
   when it approved a jury panel of eight black jurors and four white jurors with three alternates selected, one of whom was black and two of whom were white, and heard arguments regarding the prosecutor's reverse-Batson challenge and defendant's Batson challenge. State v. Braxton, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 158</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 428 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1130, 121 S. Ct. 890, 148 L. Ed. 2d 797 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in failing to conduct a Batson hearing under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   26, even though the State's acceptance rate was 25 percent for African-American prospective jurors (PJs) and 80 percent for white PJs, where: (1) defendant and the victims were African-American; (2) the State questioned the PJs in the same manner; (3) there were no racially motivated comments made or questions asked during jury selection; and (4) the responses of the PJs provided reasonable justification for exclusion. State v. Mills, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. App.</cite> 773, 741 S.E.2d 427 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Opposition to Capital Punishment on Religious Grounds.
   
   - Where the record established beyond a doubt that juror was excused, not because of his choice of religion, but because of his inability to follow the law regarding his duties as a juror, the fact that the prospective juror's religion provided the basis for his views in opposition to the death penalty did not alter the propriety of excluding him for cause. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 607</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 418 (1989); cert denied, 496 U.S. 905, 110 S. Ct. 2587, 110 L. Ed. 2d 268 (1990); State v. Warren, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 80</cite>, 499 S.E.2d 431 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where potential juror, who was a Jehovah's Witness, was stricken because of reservation about the death penalty and another prospective juror stated that he had no reservations which might impair his serving on the jury, and he was chosen to sit, there was sufficient support for the conclusion that potential juror removed from the jury because of her reservations about the death penalty, not because of her religious affiliation. State v. Eason, <cite class="nc_code">336 N.C. 730</cite>, 445 S.E.2d 917 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1096, 115 S. Ct. 764, 130 L. Ed. 2d 661 (1995).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of Defendant's Rights Was Not Shown.
   
   - Where, although the State did not outline a profile or criteria for selecting jurors, it was obvious from the record that it would strike jurors who had connections to the defendants or to a principal State's witness or whom it believed would be prejudicial against the State, the record did not reflect that the assistant district attorney made any comments indicating a purpose to discriminate, and there was no transcript of the jury's voir dire and there was incomplete information on the racial composition of the jury venire and the jury, the defendants did not show that the trial judge violated defendant's rights under either the federal or State constitutions by overruling their objections to the State's use of peremptory challenges. State v. Cannon, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 246, 374 S.E.2d 604 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">326 N.C. 37</cite>, 387 S.E.2d 450 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied a fair trial where the percentage of African-American jurors in the jury pool at his trial was 8.67 percent and the percentage of African-American jurors in the county was 20.8 percent; defendant presented no evidence showing that the alleged deficiency of African-Americans on the jury was because of the systematic exclusion of this group in the jury-selection process, and the prosecutor provided race neutral explanations for the peremptory challenges of two prospective African-American jurors. Allen v. Lee, 319 F.3d 645, vacated on other grounds, 2003 U.S. App. LEXIS 5760, on rehearing, en banc, 366 F.3d 319, 2004 U.S. App. LEXIS 8349 (4th Cir. N.C. 2004).

        Appellate Review of Findings as to Intentional Racial Discrimination.

       <p>
        Punishment Is Within Province of Legislature.
   
   - It is within the province of the General Assembly and not the judiciary to determine the extent of punishment which may be imposed on those convicted of crime. State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972). See also, State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 168</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 410, rev'd, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2292, 29 L. Ed. 2d 861 (1971); State v. Cross, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 335, 219 S.E.2d 274 (1975); State v. Legette, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 44</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 896 (1977); State v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 179</cite>, 232 S.E.2d 648 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section restricts the judiciary from imposing excessive punishments
   
   where the legislature has not prescribed a fixed maximum, and does not apply to the legislative power to impose the penalty for acts made an offense by them. State v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 608</cite>, 72 S.E. 1080 (1911).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        May Affect Legislative Enactments in Exceptional Cases.
   
   - This section is an admonition to the judiciary in imposing sentence left to an extent within its discretion by the statutes; however, there is a decided intimation that in extraordinary and exceptional cases it may be held to affect legislative enactments as well. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 804</cite>, 93 S.E. 910 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretion of Court in Sentencing.
   
   - Within the limits of the sentence permitted by the law, the character and extent of the punishment is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court, and may be reviewed only in case of manifest and gross abuse. State v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 165 S.E.2d 689 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Punishment ought to be left to the judge who inflicts it under the circumstances of each case, and ought not to be interfered with, except when the abuse is palpable. State v. Driver, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 423</cite> (1878); State v. Reid, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 714</cite>, 11 S.E. 315 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the question of punishment is left to the sound discretion of the court, the court is limited only by the prohibition against cruel or unusual punishment in this section. State v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. 209</cite>, 19 S.E.2d 863 (1942).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        What constitutes cruel and unusual punishment is a question of law
   
   for the court and is not subject to proof by expert opinion evidence. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Test as to Reasonableness of Punishment.
   
   - There are two things which have been looked upon as very good guides in determining the reasonableness of punishment: (1) what has formerly been expressly done in like cases, and (2) for the want of such particular discretion then to consider that which comes nearest to it. State v. Driver, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 423</cite> (1878).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Punishment Within Limits Fixed by Statute Cannot Be Held Cruel or Unusual.
   
   - A punishment which is within the limits authorized by statute cannot be held cruel or unusual in the constitutional sense. State v. Stansbury, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 589</cite>, 55 S.E.2d 185 (1949); State v. Welch, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 77</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 199 (1950); State v.

       <p>
        Unless Punishment Provisions of Statute Itself are Unconstitutional.
   
   - When punishment does not exceed the limits fixed by statute it cannot be classified as cruel and unusual in a constitutional sense, unless the punishment provisions of the statute itself are unconstitutional. State v. Rogers, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 411</cite>, 168 S.E.2d 345 (1969), cert. denied, 396 U.S. 1024, 90 S. Ct. 599, 24 L. Ed. 2d 518 (1970); State v. Atkinson, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 168</cite>, 179 S.E.2d 410, rev'd, 403 U.S. 948, 91 S. Ct. 2292, 29 L. Ed. 2d 861 (1971); State v. Cradle, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 198</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 296, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1047, 93 S. Ct. 537, 34 L. Ed. 2d 499 (1972); State v. Sellars, <cite class="nc_code">52 N.C. App.</cite> 380, 278 S.E.2d 907, appeal dismissed and cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">304 N.C. 200</cite>, 285 S.E.2d 108 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Correction has a duty to provide adequate medical care
   
   to inmates in its custody, and that duty is of such great importance that the State cannot avoid liability by contracting with someone else to perform it. Medley v. North Carolina Dep't of Cor., <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 837</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 654 (1992).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Consecutive Sentences.
   
   - Where there was a conviction of the violation of two separate criminal statutes, consolidated and tried as two counts under one bill of indictment, a sentence for each offense, the one to begin upon the expiration of the other term, confining the punishment as to each within that prescribed in the statute relating to it, could not be considered under the facts of the case as cruel and unusual within the inhibition of this section. State v. Malpass, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 349</cite>, 127 S.E. 248 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of two life sentences to run consecutively does not contravene the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Mosteller, <cite class="nc_code">3 N.C. App.</cite> 67, 164 S.E.2d 27 (1968). See also, State v. Bruce, <cite class="nc_code">268 N.C. 174</cite>, 150 S.E.2d 216 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentences within the statutory limits that impose consecutive sentences do not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Handsome, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 313</cite>, 266 S.E.2d 670 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Two Year Sentence.
   
   - When no time was fixed by the statute, an imprisonment for two years would not be held cruel and unusual. State v. Driver, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 423</cite> (1878); State v. Miller, <cite class="nc_code">94 N.C. 904</cite> (1886); State v. Farrington, <cite class="nc_code">141 N.C. 844</cite>, 53 S.E. 954 (1906); State v. Moschoures, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 321</cite>, 199 S.E. 92 (1938); State v. Crandall, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 148</cite>, 33 S.E.2d 861 (1945); State v. Lee, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 230</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 372 (1957).

        <b>
         De Facto Life Without Parole Sentence.
        </b>
        - North Carolina Court of Appeals joins the majority of jurisdictions that recognizes de facto life without parole sentences as cognizable and may warrant relief under the Eighth Amendment. State v. Kelliher, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).

        <b>
         Juvenile Life Sentences.
        </b>
        - Persons' inalienable rights include the enjoyment of the fruits of the labor; it is difficult to deny that incarcerating a juvenile with no hope for release until or after the point at which society no longer considers them an ordinary member of the workforce seems to run afoul of the hope for some years of life outside prison, as required by U.S. Supreme Court case law. State v. Kelliher, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury Instructions.
   
   - While trial court's jury instructions may have been confusing initially, the court ultimately set forth the required elements as to felonious assault with a deadly weapon inflicting serious injury and, therefore, did not violate the defendant's constitutional rights under this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 and 23. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">350 N.C. 411</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 106 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1084, 120 S. Ct. 808, 145 L. Ed. 2d 681 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to charge jury with exact language requested by defendant did not violate defendant's rights under the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments or N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§

   19 or 27, where the trial court used the pattern jury instruction to given in substance those of defendant's requested instructions which were correct in the law. State v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 131</cite>, 604 S.E.2d 886 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Peremptory instruction on nonstatutory mitigating circumstances
   
   which required the jury to find both that the circumstances existed and that the circumstances had mitigating value did not preclude the sentencer from considering relevant mitigating evidence in violation of the Constitution; the Constitution does not require that the sentencing jury "find" each circumstance which the court submits as potentially mitigating, but requires only that the sentencer be permitted to consider any relevant mitigating evidence. State v. Huff, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 1</cite>, 381 S.E.2d 635 (1989), vacated and remanded for further consideration at, 497 U.S. 1021, 110 S. Ct. 3266, 111 L. Ed. 2d 777 (1990) in light of McKoy v. North Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 110 S. Ct. 1227, 108 L. Ed. 2d 369 (1990), death sentence vacated, remanded for new capital sentencing proceeding, State v.

       <p>
        Scope of Evidence in Determining Punishment Upon Plea of Guilty or Nolo Contendere.
   
   - In making a determination of what punishment should be imposed after a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, a court is not confined to evidence relating to the offense charged. It may look anywhere, within reasonable limits, for other facts calculated to enable it to act wisely in fixing punishment. Hence, it may inquire into such matters as the age, the character, the education, the environment, the habits, the mentality, the propensities, and the record of the person about to be sentenced. In so doing, the court is not bound by the rules of evidence which obtain in a trial where guilt or innocence is put in issue by a plea of not guilty. State v. McKinney, <cite class="nc_code">4 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 165 S.E.2d 689 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Letter to Parole Commissioner and Instructions to Prosecuting Attorney Not Part of Sentence.
   
   - Defendant's contention that he was subjected to cruel and unusual punishment in that the trial court sentenced him to the maximum prison term permitted by statute for the offense of seduction of which he was convicted, and in addition dictated a letter to the parole commissioner in which he requested that no clemency be extended defendant, and also directed the prosecuting attorney to institute prosecution against defendant for failure to support his illegitimate child, was untenable, since the letter to the parole commissioner and the instructions to the prosecuting attorney were not parts of the sentence. State v. Brackett, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 369</cite>, 11 S.E.2d 146 (1940).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Sterilization.
   
   - The contention that sterilization amounts to cruel and unusual punishment is without basis in law, since the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Constitution refers to those persons convicted of a crime, and sterilization is not a criminal proceeding within the meaning of this section. In re Moore, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 95</cite>, 221 S.E.2d 307 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right Not Compromised.
   
   - Defendant was not denied his rights to confrontation, to effective assistance of counsel, to due process, to a jury trial, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment when the trial court denied defendant's motion for a mistrial based on the alleged misconduct of a juror; the juror inadvertent failure to disclose the 40-year-old information she had forgotten did not amount to concealment, and the juror demonstrated no bias. State v. Maske, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 40</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 521 (2004).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        First-Degree Murder.
   
   - Defendant's right was not violated when the trial court set bond as "no bond" and "zero" because defendant was charged with first-degree murder, a crime for which, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15As0Va26s15A-533ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-533(c)</a></cite>, the trial court had the discretion not to set bail. State v. Hocutt, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. App.</cite> 341, 628 S.E.2d 832 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>

        Jurisdiction to Consider 1973 Sentence in 2014.
   
   - Trial court had jurisdiction over a 1973 judgment to consider whether defendant's sentence was invalid under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1415ol1b8" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1415(b)(8)</a></cite>, because he argued that a sentence of life for burglary was excessive under evolving standards of decency and U.S. Const., amend.

       <p>
        <b>
         Criminal Trespass.
        </b>
        - Although not expressly limited by statute, the extent of punishment for the crime of criminal trespass was limited by this section, proscribing cruel or unusual punishments, and decisions of the State court indicate that imprisonment for up to two years would not be an "unusual punishment." Klopfer v. North Carolina, 385 U.S. 916, 87 S. Ct. 226, 17 L. Ed. 2d 141 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Armed Robbery.
   
   - The punishment provisions concerning armed robbery are constitutionally valid. State v. Legette, <cite class="nc_code">292 N.C. 44</cite>, 231 S.E.2d 896 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Death Penalty.
   
   - The State Supreme Court reaffirmed its position that the death penalty statute does not violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19 and this section. State v. McHone, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 627</cite>, 435 S.E.2d 296 (1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1046, 114 S. Ct. 1577, 128 L. Ed. 2d 220 (1994).

   14-190.17 are constitutional as drawn; while potentially beyond constitutional bounds if improperly applied, these sections are not so substantially overbroad as to require constitutional invalidation on their face. Cinema I Video, Inc. v. Thornburg, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 485</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 383 (1987).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition.
   
   - Sentence prescribed by statute for violation of prohibition law was held not to be cruel or unusual within the meaning of this section. State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 285</cite>, 148 S.E. 244 (1929).
   <br />
       </p>

   the sentencing scheme does not violate the North Carolina Constitution. State v. Anthony, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. App.</cite> 573, 516 S.E.2d 195, appeal dismissed, cert. granted, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 109</cite>, 516 S.E.2d 195, aff'd, 528 S.E.2d 321 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Habitual Felon Act.
   
   - Defendant's constitutional challenges to his sentence as an habitual felon failed because (1) the North Carolina Habitual Felon Act was not violative of the Separation of Powers Clause; (2) there was no double jeopardy infirmity inherent in the Habitual Felon Act as applied in conjunction with the North Carolina Structured Sentencing Act; and (3) the state appellate court and the state supreme court have rejected constitutional challenges to the Habitual Felon Act based on allegations of cruel and unusual punishment. State v. McIlwaine, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 397, 610 S.E.2d 399 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Life Sentence for Burglary.
   
   - Defendant's 1973 sentence of life imprisonment with the possibility of parole for second-degree burglary was not cruel and unusual under U.S. Const., amend. VIII and N.C. Const., Art. I,

       <p>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Armed Robbery.
   
   - A sentence of 24 to 30 years for the offense of robbery with firearms did not exceed the maximum prescribed by statute and did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment. State v. LePard, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 157</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 875 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Breaking and Entering and Other Property Crimes
   
   - Three sentences of 47 months each, to run concurrently, imposed on defendant's plea of nolo contendere to three felony counts charging felonious breaking and entering, larceny, and larceny of an automobile, being well within the statutory limits, could not be considered cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 697</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 388 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        A sentence of 25 years' imprisonment, imposed after a plea of guilty to 4 indictments charging felonious breaking and entering and larceny, did not exceed the statutory maximum and was not cruel and unusual punishment in the constitutional sense. State v. Greer, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 143</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 849 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of a sentence of imprisonment of 7 to 9 years upon plea of nolo contendere to the offenses of breaking and entering and larceny was not cruel or unusual punishment in a constitutional sense. State v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 448</cite>, 156 S.E.2d 854 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Concealed Weapons.
   
   - Punishment of 30 days confinement in jail for carrying concealed weapons would be upheld. State v. Woodlief, <cite class="nc_code">172 N.C. 885</cite>, 90 S.E. 137 (1916). See also, State v. Mangum, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 477</cite>, 121 S.E. 765 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Drug Trafficking
   
   - The defendant's sentence was not disproportionate to her crimes although her more culpable co-conspirators received lesser or equivalent sentences after plea-arrangements where the sentences imposed upon defendant, albeit consecutive, were within the presumptive statutory range authorized for her drug trafficking offenses under the Structured Sentencing Act. State v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. App.</cite> 590, 530 S.E.2d 297 (2000).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Escape.
   
   - A sentence of imprisonment for 12 months for felonious escape did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of this section. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 168 S.E.2d 418 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Kidnapping and Rape.
   
   - Imposition on defendant of two concurrent terms of life imprisonment for kidnapping and first-degree rape did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment since the sentences were authorized by statute. State v. Squire, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 112</cite>, 273 S.E.2d 688 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Letting Dogs Run at Large.
   
   - As to fine or imprisonment for owners of bird dogs who permit them to run at large during the closed season for quail, see State v. Blake, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 608</cite>, 72 S.E. 1080 (1911).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of two consecutive life sentences did not constitute cruel and unusual punishment
   
   in violation of the State Constitution, where the defendant was convicted of four first-degree burglaries, three first-degree rapes, and eight first-degree sexual offenses. The sentence imposed was authorized under the statutes, and the sentence was not disproportionate to the crimes committed. State v. Woodard, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. App.</cite> 687, 404 S.E.2d 6 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 504</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 550 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirteen-year Old Sentenced to Life Imprisonment.
   
   - A life sentence imposed on a 13-year old was not excessive as cruel and unusual punishment, where the sentence was imposed for a first-degree sexual offense, and the punishment was suitable both with regard to evolving community standards, the nature of the crime, as well as the defendant's reaction to the crime, the likelihood of his rehabilitation, and his home situation. State v. Green, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 588</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 819 (1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1111, 119 S. Ct. 883, 142 L. Ed. 2d 783 (1999).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Life Sentence for Sex Abuse Committed When Defendant Was 16 Years Old.
   
   - As sentencing a juvenile to life imprisonment was constitutionally permissible, the fact that defendant was 16 when he sexually abused his half-brother did not render his sentence of 32 to 40 years cruel and unusual punishment under U.S. Const., amend. VIII or N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   27. State v. Pettigrew, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. App.</cite> 248, 693 S.E.2d 698 (2010), dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">364 N.C. 439</cite>, 706 S.E.2d 467, 2010 N.C. LEXIS 1160 (2010).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile Sentence of Life With Parole.
   
   - Defendant's felony murder sentence of life with the possibility of parole for a crime committed when defendant was 16 did not violate the North Carolina Constitution because, despite a slight difference in wording between the Eighth Amendment and N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   27, a determination that the sentence did not violate the Eighth Amendment foreclosed a claim that the sentence violated the North Carolina Constitution. State v. Seam, <cite class="nc_code">263 N.C. App.</cite> 355, 823 S.E.2d 605 (2018), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">373 N.C. 529</cite>, 837 S.E.2d 870, 2020 N.C. LEXIS 84 (2020).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandatory Life Sentence.
   
   - Mandatory life sentence for first degree sexual offense does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment under the State or federal Constitution. Supreme Court of North Carolina has repeatedly rejected argument that a life sentence for first degree sexual offense is cruel and unusual punishment. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 660, 397 S.E.2d 647 (1990).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandatory Life Imprisonment Without Parole.
   
   - Imposing a mandatory sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on defendant, who was convicted of first degree murder under the felony murder rule, violated defendant's right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment because defendant was under 18 years of age at the time he committed the offense. State v. Pemberton, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. App.</cite> 234, 743 S.E.2d 719 (2013).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Juvenile Sentence Unconstitutional De Facto Life Without Parole Punishment.
        </b>
        - As a juvenile, defendant's consecutive sentences of life and parole eligibility at 50 years constituted an unconstitutional de facto life without parole punishment; the constitution required that defendant, as a juvenile who was neither incorrigible nor irredeemable, have his hope for some years of life outside prison walls restored, and the court instructed the trial court to enter two concurrent sentences of life with parole, the only constitutionally permissible sentence available under the facts presented. State v. Kelliher, - N.C. App.
   - , - S.E.2d - (Oct. 6, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Manslaughter.
   
   - Upon conviction of manslaughter, punishment for 9 years in the penitentiary would be upheld. State v. Lance, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 551</cite>, 63 S.E. 198 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of 12 to 20 years' imprisonment for involuntary manslaughter was within the discretionary limits fixed by statute, and while the punishment inflicted was substantial, the judgment pronounced did not come within the constitutional inhibition against "cruel or unusual punishments." State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 82</cite>, 76 S.E.2d 363 (1953). See also, State v. Brooks, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 186</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 354 (1963), in which the sentence imposed was for not less than 10 nor more than 20 years' imprisonment.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Possession of Housebreaking Implements.
   
   - A sentence of not less than 20 nor more than 30 years on a plea of guilty to the charge of unlawful possession of implements of housebreaking constituted cruel and unusual punishment within the meaning of this section. State v. Blackmon, <cite class="nc_code">260 N.C. 352</cite>, 132 S.E.2d 880 (1963).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Referral of Bail Setting to Another Judicial Officer Not Wrongful Confinement.
   
   - Where the defendant was taken before a judicial officer for the setting of bail within a reasonable time, although the magistrate may have erred at that point by referring the defendant's case to another judicial officer for the setting of bail rather than setting reasonable bail himself, the error did not make the defendant's temporary further confinement an unreasonable seizure or "wrongful confinement" in any constitutional sense so as to necessitate suppression of his confession. State v. Simpson, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 313</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 332 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 963, 108 S. Ct. 1230, 99 L. Ed. 2d 430 (1988).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to Intervene Ex Mero Motu.
   
   - Defendant's rights to due process and a fair trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   18, 19, 23, 24, and 27 were not violated by the trial court's failure to intervene ex mero motu in the prosecutor's closing argument, as while comparisons between criminal defendants and animals were strongly disfavored, the state's use of an analogy to animals in packs helped explain the complex legal theory surrounding premeditation and deliberation. State v. Oakes, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. App.</cite> 18, 703 S.E.2d 476, review denied and dismissed <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 197</cite>, 709 S.E.2d 918, 2011 N.C. LEXIS 541 (2011).

        Robbery.
   
   - A sentence for robbery which was within the statutory maximum did not constitute the cruel and unusual punishment forbidden by this section. State v. Witherspoon, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 714</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 362 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Vagrancy.
   
   - The punishment for vagrancy could not exceed 30 days under the statute. In re Watson, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 340</cite>, 72 S.E. 1049 (1911).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Worthless Check.
   
   - A sentence to 18 months labor on the roads entered upon defendant's plea of guilty to a charge of drawing and uttering a worthless check was held not to be "cruel and unusual" in a constitutional sense. State v. White, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 513</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 436 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        False Pretenses Enhanced By Habitual Offender Status.
   
   - Defendant had a lengthy criminal record and was sentenced accordingly for <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Va19s14-100" target="_blank">G.S. 14-100</a></cite> false pretenses, which sentence was enhanced by his status of being an habitual offender under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia2As14-7.6" target="_blank">G.S. 14-7.6</a></cite>; the sentence of 142 months to 180 months was within the range for a Class C level V felon, was not disproportionate to the defendant's 25-year history of criminal convictions, and was not cruel and unusual under U.S. Const., amends. VIII, XIV. State v. Ledwell, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 314, 614 S.E.2d 562 (2005).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fine Imposed Not Unconstitutional.
   
   - Defendant failed to show that the fine imposed was unconstitutional because the $ 1,000 fine against defendant did not constitute an abuse of discretion and was not otherwise unlawful; given the relatively modest amount of the fine as compared with the seriousness of the offense, strangulation of defendant's two-year-old daughter, the fine was not grossly disproportional to the gravity of defendant's offense. State v. Zubiena, <cite class="nc_code">251 N.C. App.</cite> 477, 796 S.E.2d 40 (2016).

       <p>
        Purpose.
   
   - The purpose of this section is to prevent use of the criminal process to enforce the payment of civil obligations, directly or indirectly. State v. Caudle, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 550</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 778 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Section Only Applicable to Actions Arising Out of Contract.
   
   - This section, which prohibits imprisonment for debt, is only applicable to actions arising out of or founded upon contract. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 203 S.E.2d 63 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has no application to actions for tort;
   
   it is confined to causes of action arising ex contractu. Long v. McLean, <cite class="nc_code">88 N.C. 3</cite> (1883). See also, Ledford v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 447</cite>, 193 S.E. 722 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A fine or penalty imposed by a municipal ordinance is treated as a debt
   
   and, under this section of the Constitution, a person from whom it is attempted to be collected is exempt from arrest. State v. Earnhardt, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 789</cite>, 12 S.E. 426 (1890).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment on a note is a debt
   
   and the defendant cannot be arrested therefor. Stewart v. Bryan, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 46</cite>, 28 S.E. 18 (1897).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Any judgment rendered for nonperformance is a debt
   
   and can only be enforced by a levy on the sale of defendant's property. Defendant cannot be imprisoned therefor. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 40</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 240 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Costs of Prosecution Are Not Debt.
   
   - Costs of prosecution against a prosecutor (upon acquittal of the accused or nolle prosequi entered), or against the accused upon a verdict of guilty, or a fine imposed, do not constitute a debt within the meaning of this section of the Constitution, and hence the defendant may be imprisoned for nonpayment of the same. State v. Wallin, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 578</cite> (1883).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor is the duty of maintaining an illegitimate child
   
   such a debt as is contemplated by this section. State v. Palin, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 472</cite> (1869); State v. Beasley, <cite class="nc_code">75 N.C. 211</cite> (1876).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxes do not constitute a debt
   
   within the meaning of the Constitution. State v. Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 203 S.E.2d 63 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Imprisonment for failure to pay a sum of money is prohibited except to enforce an appropriate judicial order
   
   which has been willfully disobeyed so as to constitute contempt of court. Stanley v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 129</cite>, 37 S.E.2d 118 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Punishment for Contempt.
   
   - Willful failure of a husband to comply with the court's order to pay his wife an amount for support is a contempt, and can be punished as such by imprisonment, and is not within the constitutional inhibition against imprisonment for debt. Wilson v. Wilson, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 40</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 240 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Specific Performance of Separation Agreement.
   
   - The remedy of specific performance of a separation agreement contemplating enforcement by civil contempt proceedings is not available in this State. Sainz v. Sainz, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 245 S.E.2d 372 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The enforcement of support payments provided in an extra-judicial separation agreement is accomplished as in the case of any other civil contract, i.e., through an action for breach of the contract seeking a judgment for sums due. Such an action, sounding in contract, is not enforceable by execution in personam in the form of imprisonment for civil contempt for noncompliance, by reason of the constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt. Sainz v. Sainz, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 744, 245 S.E.2d 372 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff was entitled to a decree of specific performance ordering defendant to comply with a separation agreement which had not been incorporated into a judicial decree because the available remedy at law for the enforcement of such agreement was inadequate. Moore v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 14</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 735 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of Restitution Is Valid Condition for Suspension of Sentence.
   
   - Subject to the prohibition contained in this section against imprisonment for debt, except in cases of fraud, payment of restitution by a criminal defendant to the victims of his crime may be a valid condition for suspension of sentence. State v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 235 S.E.2d 920 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Restitution Payment as Condition for Acceptance of Plea Bargain.
   
   - Payment of restitution by a criminal defendant to the victims of his crime may be a valid condition for acceptance of a plea bargain. But when restitution is ordered as result of a plea bargain, it must be to a specific aggrieved party, and this party must be named in the judgment. State v. McIntyre, <cite class="nc_code">33 N.C. App.</cite> 557, 235 S.E.2d 920 (1977).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Suspension of Sentence on Condition that Defendant Pay Unrelated Civil Obligation.
   
   - To suspend a sentence of imprisonment for a criminal act, however just the sentence may be per se, on condition that the defendant pay obligations unrelated to such criminal act, however justly owing, is a use of the criminal process to enforce the payment of a civil obligation, and lends itself to the oppressive action which this section is designed to forbid. To sustain the suspension of sentence upon such a condition would invite misuse of the practice of suspending sentence. It would substitute for the humane consideration and the objective reformation, upon which the practice ought to rest, an entirely different purpose. State v. Caudle, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 550</cite>, 173 S.E.2d 778 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For an order of restitution to be valid it must be related to the criminal act
   
   for which defendant was convicted, or else the provision may run afoul of the constitutional provision prohibiting imprisonment for debt. State v. Froneberger, <cite class="nc_code">81 N.C. App.</cite> 398, 344 S.E.2d 344 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions in probationary judgments which require restitution
   
   are constitutionally permissible if they are related to the criminal act for which the defendant is convicted. State v. Bass, <cite class="nc_code">53 N.C. App.</cite> 40, 280 S.E.2d 7 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>

         II. FRAUD.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The words "except in cases of fraud"
   
   comprehend not only fraud in attempting to hinder, delay and defeat the collection of a debt by concealing property and other fraudulent devices, but embrace also fraud in making the contract, such as false representations, and fraud in incurring the liability; for instance, when an administrator commits a fraud by applying the funds of the estate to his own use, paying his own debts, and the like. Melvin v. Melvin, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 384</cite> (1875).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Imprisonment for Debt Absent Fraud.
   
   - This section clearly means that there shall at least be no imprisonment to enforce the payment of a debt under final process, unless it has been adjudged, upon an allegation duly made in the complaint and a corresponding issue found by a jury, that there has been fraud. Ledford v. Emerson, <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 527</cite>, 55 S.E. 969, 10 L.R.A. (n.s.) 362 (1906); East Coast Fertilizer Co. v. Hardee, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 653</cite>, 191 S.E. 725 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Section Inapplicable to Contracts Involving Fraud.
   
   - This constitutional prohibition against imprisonment for debt has been held to apply to debt in the strict sense of an obligation arising out of contract, and hence would not apply to contracts involving fraud, including fraud in contracting the debt or incurring the obligation. Nunn v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 374</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 497 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A party's activities in adding "payment in full" language to a check
   
   after it had been cashed by another party, and then attempting to use the check to defeat the other party's claim, constituted fraud within the intent of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sXIIIa34s1-410" target="_blank">G.S. 1-410(4)</a></cite> and within this section.

       This section guarantees the right to bear arms
   
   to the people in a collective sense, similar to the concept of a militia, and also to individuals. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose.
   
   - The purpose of the constitutional guaranty of the right to bear arms is to secure a well-regulated militia. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The purpose of the declaration that a well-regulated militia is necessary to the security of a free state was to insure the existence of a State militia as an alternative to a standing army. Such armies were regarded as peculiarly obnoxious in any free government. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Militia".
   
   - Militia is defined as the body of citizens in a state, enrolled for discipline as a military force, but not engaged in actual service except in emergencies, as distinguished from regular troops or a standing army. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).

   - Any statute, or construction of a common-law rule, which would amount to a destruction of the right to bear arms would be unconstitutional. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).

       Convicted Felons.
   
   - G.S. 14-451.1 did not violate the convicted felon's due process or equal protection rights because plaintiff's right to possess firearms was not a vested right and the statutory scheme treated all felons the same and served to protect the health, welfare, and safety of the citizens of North Carolina.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in dismissing the charges against defendant on the basis that the Felony Firearms Act was unconstitutional as applied to him, as it was not unreasonable to prohibit defendant, who had two felony convictions for selling a controlled substance and one for attempted assault with a deadly weapon, from possessing firearms in order to preserve public peace and safety.

      </p>

      <p>
       Right Is Subject to Regulation.
   
   - For case stating that the last clause of this provision constitutes an exception to the first and indicates the extent to which the right of the people to bear arms can be restricted, that is, that the legislature can prohibit the carrying of concealed weapons, but no further, see State v. Kerner, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 574</cite>, 107 S.E. 222 (1921).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right of individuals to bear arms is not absolute, but is subject to regulation. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
      </p>
      <p>
       The right to bear arms, which is protected and safeguarded by the federal and State Constitutions, is subject to the authority of the General Assembly, in the exercise of the police power, to regulate, but the regulation must be reasonable and not prohibitive, and must bear a fair relation to the preservation of the public peace and safety. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right to Bear Arms and Carrying of Concealed Weapons Distinguished.
   
   - This provision of the Constitution plainly observes the distinction between the "right to keep and bear arms" and "the practice of carrying concealed weapons." The first, it is declared, shall not be infringed, while the latter may be prohibited. Even without this constitutional provision, the legislature may by law regulate the right to bear arms in a manner conducive to the public peace. State v. Speller, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 697</cite> (1882), approved in State v. Reams, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 556</cite>, 27 S.E. 1004 (1897).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not license self-appointed vigilantes,
   
   extremist groups, hoodlums, or any persons whomsoever to arm themselves for the purpose of intimidating the people and then, so long as they flaunt those weapons, to roam with impunity to the terror of the people. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Common-Law Offense Not Abrogated.
   
   - The constitutional guaranty of the right to bear arms does not abrogate the common-law offense of going armed with unusual weapons to the terror of the people. State v. Dawson, <cite class="nc_code">272 N.C. 535</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 1 (1968).

      <p>
       The purpose of this constitutional provision
   
   was not to prevent the community from exercising legislatively authorized powers to operate public enterprises, but to prevent the community from surrendering its power to another person or set of persons by grant of exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges unless they were granted in consideration of public services; it is not retention of powers, but alienation of powers, that is prohibited. Madison Cablevision, Inc. v. City of Morganton, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 634</cite>, 386 S.E.2d 200 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Fundamental Safeguards.
   
   - The wisdom and foresight of our ancestors is nowhere more clearly shown than in providing these fundamental safeguards against partial and class legislation, the insidious and ever-working foes of free and equal government. Simonton v. Lanier, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 498</cite> (1874).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Counties Not Within Purview of Section.
       </b>
       - Counties, as political subdivisions of the State, do not seem to be within the purview of this section, considering the vast number of local legislative acts, including ABC laws in contradiction to the general prohibition law, which are passed each session by the General Assembly. Mathis v. North Carolina, 266 F. Supp. 841 (M.D.N.C. 1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not preclude the legislature from making classifications and distinctions in the application of laws,
   
   provided they are reasonable and just and not arbitrary. Motley v. State Bd. of Barber Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 337</cite>, 45 S.E.2d 550, 175 A.L.R. 253 (1947).
      </p>
      <p>
       This provision does not forbid all classifications of persons with reference to the imposition of legal duties and obligations. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967); Lamb v. Wedgewood S. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 419</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 868 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Motivation of Legislation Determinative.
   
   - The constitutional limitation contained in this section has been frequently invoked by the Supreme Court to strike down legislation conferring special privileges not in consideration of public service; but where the motivation is for a public purpose and in the public interest, and does not confer exclusive privilege, legislation has been upheld. Brumley v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 691</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 281, 162 A.L.R. 930 (1945); State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       The limitation of this section, like that of N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19, does not apply to an exemption from a duty imposed upon citizens generally if the purpose of the exemption is the promotion of the general welfare, as distinguished from the benefit of the individual, and if there is reasonable basis for the legislature to conclude that the granting of the exemption would be in the public interest. State v. Knight, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 100</cite>, 152 S.E.2d 179 (1967); Lamb v. Wedgewood S. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">308 N.C. 419</cite>, 302 S.E.2d 868 (1983).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section constitutes a specific constitutional prohibition against gifts of public money,
   
   and the legislature has no power to compel or even to authorize a municipal corporation to pay a gratuity to an individual to adjust a claim which the municipality is under no legal obligation to pay. Brown v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 744</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 104 (1943).

      <p>
       Statutes Which Confer Benefits on a Particular Group of Persons.
   
   - A statute which confers an exemption that benefits a particular group of persons is not an exclusive emolument or privilege within the meaning of this section, if: (1) the exemption is intended to promote the general welfare rather than the benefit of the individual, and (2) there is a reasonable basis for the legislature to conclude the granting of the exemption serves the public interest.

       Former employee did not adequately allege a free speech claim, an equal protection claim, and an exclusive emoluments claim when she had an adequate state remedy for those violations
   
   because the employee's claim under the Whistleblower Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a14s126-86" target="_blank">G.S. 126-86</a></cite>, was an adequate state law remedy for her alleged free speech violation, her claim of misappropriation of state funds was expressly covered by the Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.126.html#t126a14s126-84" target="_blank">G.S. 126-84</a></cite>, and thus was an adequate state law remedy for her exclusive emoluments clause claim; because the employee's equal protection claim alleged discrimination based on activities protected by the Whistleblower Act, it was also precluded.

       Validity of G.S.
   
   24-5. - The Legislature could reasonably have concluded that the classification scheme established by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.024.html#t24a01s24-5" target="_blank">G.S. 24-5</a></cite> would best serve to further important and legitimate public purposes, including compensation of a plaintiff for the loss-of-use value of a damage award, the prevention of unjust enrichment to liability insurers who are required by law to maintain claim reserves on which interest is earned, and the promotion of settlement by these insurers, who unlike self-insurers, have as their primary business the insuring, investigation, defense and settlement of claims. The Legislature could have reasonably concluded that the distinction between defendants with liability insurance and those without was a valid one, and that the public welfare would be best served by such a classification. Therefore, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.024.html#t24a01s24-5" target="_blank">G.S. 24-5</a></cite> does not create a special emolument or privilege within the meaning of this section.

       Severance Pay.

       The common-law rule against perpetuities is recognized and enforced
   
   in this State. The rule is not one of construction, but a positive mandate of law, to be obeyed irrespective of the question of intention. Its primary purpose is to restrict the permissible creation of future interests and prevent undue restraint upon or suspension of the right of alienation. Whenever the future interest takes effect or the right of alienation is suspended beyond the period stipulated in the rule, it is violative thereof. Mercer v. Mercer, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 101</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 229 (1949); Parker v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 399</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 899 (1960).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common-law rule against perpetuities has been long recognized and enforced in this jurisdiction, and its application has the continuing sanction of this section. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Norris, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 178, 203 S.E.2d 657 (1974).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Early Vesting of Estates Favored.
   
   - Where, by a correct interpretation of a will, it will reasonably be allowed, the law will favor the early vesting of estates against the interests of a contingent remainderman. Walker v. Trollinger, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 744</cite>, 135 S.E. 871 (1926).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The rule against perpetuities applies to private trusts.
   
   And when a private trust violates the rule, the court will not limit the duration of the trust, but will declare the whole trust invalid. Mercer v. Mercer, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 101</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 229 (1949).

   - Because N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   34, does not require application of the common law rule against perpetuities, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23(a)</a></cite> does not violate the North Carolina Constitution as a result of its repeal of the common law rule; <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23(a)</a></cite> is consistent with the constitutional prohibition of perpetuities in N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   34, because it provides a mechanism for preventing unreasonable restraints on alienation. Rather than addressing alienability of property indirectly by regulating the vesting of remote interests, as does the common law rule against perpetuities, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23</a></cite> directly preserves alienability of property by prohibiting suspension of the power of alienation for longer than the period provided; thus, G.S. 41-23 is a constitutional, valid exercise of the General Assembly's authority.

       In the historical context of the passage of the North Carolina Constitution, a perpetuity was the attempt to forbid the alienation of lands under any circumstances, and to provide for their descent or disposition in a fixed, unchangeable way. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23(a)</a></cite> adopted the approach of requiring the existence of the power of alienation rather than requiring that remote future interests vest or terminate within a certain time period; thus, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23</a></cite>, a trust may remain valid in perpetuity as long as the appropriate rights of sale or termination are held.

       The General Assembly has modified both the common law rule and the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP) as each applies to trusts by adopting <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23</a></cite>, which expressly supersedes both the common law rule against perpetuities and the USRAP. <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.041.html#t41a02s41-23" target="_blank">G.S. 41-23</a></cite> contains no requirement regarding the time period in which a remote future interest must vest, but maintains the marketability of property.

       Statute Failing to Provide for Successors to Office Did Not Create Perpetuity.
   
   - The General Assembly having failed to appoint or provide for the election of successors to the highway and sinking fund commissioners of Madison County, who were appointed for a four or six-year term by Public-Local Laws of 1931, c. 341, the General Assembly would be presumed to acquiesce in their continuance in office, and the General Assembly having power to terminate, change or continue the appointments, it would not be held that it intended to create perpetuities or exclusive emoluments in violation of any of the provisions of this article; said commissioners thus would continue to hold office with power to discharge the duties thereof.

        Unauthorized Practice of Law.
       </b>
       - State prosecutors were properly granted summary judgment in action to enjoin enforcement of North Carolina's unauthorized practice of law statutes because statutes did not unconstitutionally restrict trade association's associational rights, statutes survived intermediate scrutiny and did not unlawfully burden association's freedom of speech as state had established reasonable fit between statutes and substantial government interest in regulating legal profession to protect clients, statutes did not deny association due process as there was rational basis to restrict corporate ownership of professional businesses to protect consumers, statutes were not vague, and statutes did not violate state constitution's Monopoly Clause.

       Regulation of Ambulance Service.
   
   - For case holding county ordinance regulating ambulance service unconstitutional, see Whaley v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 168 S.E.2d 411 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Former G.S. 153-9(58)(a)(6) was not void as being in contravention of constitutional prohibitions against monopolies and exclusive emoluments, since the paragraph did not provide that liability insurance would be the exclusive method of indemnifying persons or property against loss due to negligent operation of the ambulance service. Whaley v. Lenoir County, <cite class="nc_code">5 N.C. App.</cite> 319, 168 S.E.2d 411 (1969).
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of the possible retroactive application of the grandfather rights provided for, former G.S. 153-9(58)(a)(2) was unconstitutional, since it invaded the personal and property rights guaranteed and protected by the Constitution.

       Denying a nonprofit corporation the right to construct and operate its proposed hospital

       Plaintiff's Monopolistic Conduct No Defense to Defendant's Unfair Competition.
   
   - Even if plaintiff's conduct in protecting its property was a monopolistic practice, it was not a defense to an action for injunctive relief and compensatory damages brought by plaintiffs against defendants for alleged unfair competition where defendants' conduct had been determined to be unfair competition. United Artists Records, Inc. v. Eastern Tape Corp., <cite class="nc_code">19 N.C.

       Automobile Dealer Franchise.
   
   - The State can require that if an automobile manufacturer gives a franchise to a dealer to sell automobiles, that the manufacturer include in the terms of the franchise agreement the right that the dealer have an exclusive franchise in a certain trade area so long as the dealer abides by the terms of the franchise agreement. American Motors Sales Corp. v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 294 S.E.2d 764 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 311</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 351 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Grant of franchise to automobile dealer is not an agreement between competitors not to compete, but a contract between a manufacturer and a dealer. The State has enacted legislation which gives automobile dealers some protection after they have made investments and taken other action, relying on contracts they have made, and the State has the power to do this. American Motors Sales Corp. v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 294 S.E.2d 764 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 311</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 351 (1984).

For the General Assembly to require the manufacturer to do what it could bargain to do if it desired to execute a contract is not the granting of a monopoly. American Motors Sales Corp. v. Peters, <cite class="nc_code">58 N.C. App.</cite> 684, 294 S.E.2d 764 (1982), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">311 N.C. 311</cite>, 317 S.E.2d 351 (1984).

       Cooperative Stabilization Corporation.
   
   - Tobacco warehouses were not able to assert constitutional claims of deprivation of property rights and prohibition against monopolies against a tobacco cooperative stabilization corporation because the corporation was not a State actor.

       Liberal Construction.
   
   - The Constitution must be construed in the light of its history, and must be liberally construed in aid of progress, but a liberal construction is especially required in interpreting those provisions safeguarding individual liberty. State v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 746</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 854, 128 A.L.R. 658 (1940), decided under Art. I,

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sovereign Immunity.
   
   - Sovereign immunity was not available as a defense to the claims of temporary employees that were brought directly under the North Carolina Constitution against state agencies and employees. Sanders v. State Pers. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. App.</cite> 15, 644 S.E.2d 10 (2007).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Exhaustion of Other State Remedies Required.
   
   - A state constitutional action is not proper under this section, unless no other state remedy is available; here, an existing state tort remedy precluded plaintiff's assault-based constitutional claim against an arresting officer. Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 538 S.E.2d 601 (2000).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not error to grant summary judgment in favor of a police officer and a city, as to a citizen's claims under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19, 20, 21, and 35, based on the officer's alleged use of excessive force, because the fact that the citizen had to overcome the affirmative defense of public officer immunity to succeed on the citizen's tort claims did not negate the claims' adequacy as a remedy, so a direct cause of action under the North Carolina Constitution was not permitted. Debaun v. Kuszaj, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 767 S.E.2d 353 (2014).

       Relation to Declaratory Judgment Actions.
   
   - Although the North Carolina Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-253" target="_blank">G.S. 1-253</a></cite> to 1-267, empowers a trial court to decline a request for declaratory relief under certain circumstances, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001.html#t01sVIIIa26s1-257" target="_blank">G.S. 1-257</a></cite> should not be applied to thwart a properly presented constitutional challenge; the North Carolina courts are obligated to protect fundamental rights when those rights are threatened and the North Carolina Constitution admonishes that a frequent recurrence to fundamental principles is absolutely necessary to preserve the blessings of liberty. Therefore, where it clearly appears either that property or fundamental human rights are denied in violation of constitutional guarantees, and where a statutory provision is specifically challenged by a person directly affected by it, declaratory relief as to the constitutional validity of that provision is appropriate; in other words, when the requested declaration satisfies the recognized criteria, the trial court has no discretion to decline the request. Augur v. Augur, <cite class="nc_code">356 N.C. 582</cite>, 573 S.E.2d 125 (2002).

   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19 and 35 as: (1) a sex offender's alleged liberty interest to enter a park owned by a town to have barbecues and enjoy nature was not protected by the right to intrastate travel; (2) an asserted liberty interest to freely roam in parks was not a fundamental right; (3) a town had been delegated the authority to prohibit acts detrimental to its citizens' health, safety, or welfare by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa08s160A-174" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-174</a></cite>; (4) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14sVIIa27As14-208.5" target="_blank">G.S. 14-208.5</a></cite> recognized that sex offenders posed a high risk of engaging in sex offenses; and (5) Woodfin, N.C.

       North Carolina State Personnel Commission regulated employment scheme, which was meant to delineate state employees and their appointments, was constitutional
   
   because the regulations did not exhibit a situation in which the North Carolina Legislature was interfering with an ordinary and simple occupation, nor was the employment scheme intended to be free from governmental regulation. Moreover, the regulations were rationally related to a substantial governmental interest, and nothing in the governmental action arbitrarily or irrationally limited temporary state employees' rights to earn a livelihood.

       Property May Be Taken Only for Public Use.
   
   - Although a condemning entity must establish that a proposed taking will further a public purpose before a condemnation can be authorized, there is no reason why a reciprocal burden to establish the existence of a public purpose should be imposed upon a property owner who has been deprived of his or her property by governmental action taken for a non-public purpose.

      <p>
       Exhaustion of Other State Remedies Required.
   
   - A state constitutional action is not proper under this section, unless no other state remedy is available; here, an existing state tort remedy precluded plaintiff's assault-based constitutional claim against an arresting officer. Glenn-Robinson v. Acker, <cite class="nc_code">140 N.C. App.</cite> 606, 538 S.E.2d 601 (2000).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Instruction Informing Jury of Death Penalty.
   
   - Denial of defendant's written request for an instruction that "should you [the jury] return a verdict of guilty to the alleged crime of rape, the death penalty will be imposed by this Court" did not deny him his constitutional right of due process as guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amends. V and XIV and by N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   19, 23 and this section, since the record revealed that each juror knew that the sentence of death would be imposed upon the return of a verdict of guilty. State v. Bernard, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 321</cite>, 218 S.E.2d 327 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       An extension in the city council's term of office
   
   neither violated petitioners' constitutional right to participate in the political process nor infringed upon the rights of voters. Crump v. Snead, <cite class="nc_code">134 N.C. App.</cite> 353, 517 S.E.2d 384, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">351 N.C. 101</cite>, 541 S.E.2d 143 (1999).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Constitutional Right to Erosion Control.
   
   - Plaintiffs' claims that hardened structure rules, promulgated by defendants, effected a taking of property without just compensation and violated <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.113A.html#t113Aa07s113A-128" target="_blank">G.S. 113A-128</a></cite> of the Coastal Area Management Act were properly dismissed, because plaintiffs failed to cite any persuasive authority for the proposition that a littoral or riparian landowner has a right to erect hardened structures in statutorily designated areas of environmental concern to protect their property from erosion or migration.

       <p>
        All legislative power in this State rests in the General Assembly
   
   under this section, except as authorized by the Constitution, as in cases of municipal corporations. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Security Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 595</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 688 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative power vests exclusively in the General Assembly, and except as authorized by the Constitution, as in case of municipal corporations, may not be delegated. State ex rel. Taylor v. Carolina Racing Ass'n, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 80</cite>, 84 S.E.2d 390 (1954); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        General Assembly Is Possessed of Full Legislative Powers.
   
   - Under the North Carolina Constitution, the General Assembly, so far as that instrument is concerned, is possessed of full legislative powers unless restrained by express constitutional provision or necessary implication therefrom. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        To Legislate for Protection of Health, Safety, Morals and General Welfare.
   
   - The General Assembly, exercising the police power of the State, may legislate for the protection of the public health, safety, morals and general welfare of the people. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970); In re Denial of Approval to Issue Hous. Bonds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 52</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 281 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Questions of Public Policy Are for Legislative Determination.
   
   - Absent constitutional restraint, questions as to public policy are for legislative determination. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The wisdom of an enactment is a legislative and not a judicial question.
   
   The General Assembly has the right to experiment with new modes of dealing with old evils, except as prevented by the Constitution. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Only Legislature May Amend Statute.
   
   - Only the General Assembly may amend or rewrite a statute. Ramsey v. North Carolina Veterans Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 645</cite>, 135 S.E.2d 659 (1964).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature Cannot Restrict Power of Succeeding Legislature.
   
   - An act of the General Assembly is legal unless the Constitution contains a prohibition against it. However, one legislature cannot restrict or limit by statute the right of a succeeding legislature to exercise its constitutional power to legislate in its own way. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distinction Between Delegating Power to Make Law and Conferring Authority as to Its Execution.
   
   - There is a distinction generally recognized between a delegation of the power to make a law, which necessarily includes a discretion as to what it shall be, and the conferring of authority or discretion as to its execution. The first may not be done, whereas the latter, if adequate guiding standards are laid down, is permissible under certain circumstances. State v. Lisk, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 474, 204 S.E.2d 868, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 666</cite>, 207 S.E.2d 759 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to the governor, state public safety agency, state highway patrol, and certain unidentified persons, and denying the wrecker service owner's motion for summary judgment on the wrecker service owner's declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that regulations used to remove his wrecker service business from the state's Wrecker Rotation Services List were illegal and that the regulations were preempted by federal law; the trial court had the authority to declare that the regulations were not illegal because the General Assembly granted to the state public safety agency the power to direct the state highway patrol to establish regulations for private wrecker services. Ramey v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. App.</cite> 197, 632 S.E.2d 178 (2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature Must Declare Policy, Fix Legal Principles and Provide Adequate Standards.
   
   - The legislative body must declare the policy of the law, fix legal principles which are to control in given cases, and provide adequate standards for the guidance of the administrative body or officer empowered to execute the law. Carolina-Virginia Coastal Hwy. v. Coastal Tpk. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 52</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 310 (1953); Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973); Bulova Watch Co. v.

        Exchange of Land by Board of Education.

        Delegation of Authority to Plan and Construct Interstate Highway.
   
   - The delegation of authority to the North Carolina Department of Transportation and the Board of Transportation to plan and construct an interstate highway did not constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative authority to an administrative body, unrestrained by legislative standards or sufficient procedural safeguards or political accountability. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).

        Party Benefitting From Agency Action May Not Later Challenge It On Separation of Powers Grounds.
   
   - As a taxpayer sought, received, and benefitted from a variance from <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia04s105-130.4ol1t" target="_blank">G.S. 105-130.4(t)</a></cite>'s tax allocation formula, it could not challenge, on separation-of-powers grounds, orders of the augmented North Carolina Tax Review Board that granted the variance. Philip Morris USA, Inc. v. Tolson, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Agency Did Not Violate Separation of Powers Doctrine.
   
   - Augmented North Carolina Tax Review Board did not violate the separation of powers doctrine by creating a special tax allocation formula for a multi-state corporation, because in so doing, it only exercised the powers expressly reserved for it by the General Assembly under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia04s105-130.4ol1t" target="_blank">G.S. 105-130.4(t)</a></cite>.

        Delegation to Any Other Branch, Department or Agency.

       <p>
        Legislature May Delegate Portion of Its Power Under Prescribed Standards.
   
   - As to some specific subject matter, the legislature may delegate a limited portion of its legislative power to an administrative agency if it prescribes the standards under which the agency is to exercise the delegated powers. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965); State Educ. Assistance Auth. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        A modern legislature must be able to delegate, in proper instances, a limited portion of its legislative powers to administrative bodies which are equipped to adapt legislation to complex conditions involving numerous details with which the legislature cannot deal directly. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

       <p>
        Although It Cannot Delegate Absolute Discretion to Apply or Withhold Application of Law.

   6 and this section is to elucidate the circumstances in which delegation of legislative powers is permissible. Heritage Village Church &amp; Missionary Fellowship, Inc. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 429, 253 S.E.2d 473 (1979), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 399</cite>, 263 S.E.2d 726 (1980).

       <p>
        Adequate Guiding Standards Are Required.
   
   - The constitutional inhibition against delegating legislative authority does not preclude the legislature from transferring adjudicative and rule-making powers to administrative bodies provided such transfers are accompanied by adequate guiding standards to govern the exercise of the delegated powers. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        The people, in this section, have conferred their legislative power upon the General Assembly, which may not transfer it to another officer or agency without the establishment of such standards for guidance as to retain in its own hands the supreme legislative power. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of Adequate Guiding Standards Test.
   
   - The purpose of the adequate guiding standards test is to reconcile the legislative need to delegate authority with the constitutional mandate that the legislature retain in its own hands the supreme legislative power. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Application of Adequate Guiding Standards Test.
   
   - The key to an intelligent application of the adequate guiding standards test is an understanding that, while delegations of power to administrative agencies are necessary, such transfers of power should be closely monitored to insure that the decision-making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned and that the agency is not asked to make important policy choices which might just as easily be made by the elected representatives in the legislature. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Determining Adequacy of Standards by Existence of Procedural Safeguards.
   
   - In determining whether a particular delegation of authority is supported by adequate guiding standards, it is permissible to consider whether the authority vested in the agency is subject to procedural safeguards. A key purpose of the adequate guiding standards test is to insure that the decision-making by the agency is not arbitrary and unreasoned. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Procedural safeguards tend to encourage adherence to legislative standards by the agency to which power has been delegated. The presence or absence of procedural safeguards is relevant to the broader question of whether a delegation of authority is accompanied by adequate guiding standards. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of Direction to Administrative Body with Expertise.
   
   - When there is an obvious need for expertise in the achievement of legislative goals, the General Assembly is not required to lay down a detailed agenda covering every conceivable problem which might arise in the implementation of the legislation. It is enough if general policies and standards have been articulated which are sufficient to provide direction to an administrative body possessing the expertise to adapt the legislative goals to varying circumstances. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Source of Standards.
   
   - In the search for adequate guiding standards, the primary sources of legislative guidance are declarations by the General Assembly of the legislative goals and policies which an agency is to apply when exercising its delegated powers. Such declarations need be only as specific as the circumstances permit. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Standards for Board Regulating Trade or Profession.
   
   - When the General Assembly delegates to administrative officers and agencies its own power to prescribe detailed administrative rules and regulations governing the right of individuals to engage in a trade or profession, the statute granting such authority must lay down or point to a standard for the guidance of the officer or agency in the exercise of his or its discretion. Otherwise, such statute will be deemed an unlawful delegation by the General Assembly of its own authority. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        In licensing those who desire to engage in professions or occupations such as may be proper subjects of such regulation, the legislature may confer upon executive officers or bodies the power of granting or refusing to license persons to enter such trades or professions only when it has prescribed a sufficient standard for their guidance. Revco Southeast Drug Centers, Inc. v. North Carolina Bd. of Pharmacy, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 156, 204 S.E.2d 38 (1974); In re Willis, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 1</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 771 (1975), appeal dismissed, 423 U.S. 976, 96 S. Ct. 389, 46 L. Ed. 2d 300 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Standards Are Unnecessary When Power Is Delegated in the Constitution.
   
   - The principle that the General Assembly may not transfer its legislative power without the establishment of standards for guidance has no application to a direct delegation by the people, themselves, in the Constitution of this State, of any portion of their power, legislative or otherwise. In such case, the Supreme Court looks only to the Constitution to determine what power has been delegated. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative Details May Be Left to Agency.
   
   - If it were necessary for the Turnpike Authority to formulate specific plans as to the course of the turnpike through the various municipalities, and as to the manner and method of construction, and then seek legislative approval thereof, there would be no purpose in creating the Authority; the legislature might just as well act itself in the entire matter. The prohibition against abdication of legislative power in favor of an agency was never intended to extend to such administrative details. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature May Delegate Power to Determine Facts.
   
   - The legislature cannot delegate its power to make a law; but it can make a law to delegate a power to determine some facts or state of facts upon which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. State v. Curtis, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 169</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 364 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature may not abdicate its power to make laws or delegate its supreme legislative power to any other department or body. However, it is not necessary for the legislature to ascertain the facts of, or to deal with, each case. The constitutional inhibition against delegating legislative authority does not deny to the legislature the necessary flexibility of enabling it to lay down policies and establish standards, while leaving to designated governmental agencies and administrative boards the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the legislature shall apply. Carolina-Virginia Coastal Hwy. v. Coastal Tpk. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 52</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 310 (1953); Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973); State v. Lisk, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 474, 204 S.E.2d 868, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 666</cite>, 207 S.E.2d 759 (1974); A-S-P Assocs. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 207</cite>, 258 S.E.2d 444 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The General Assembly, for the purpose of carrying its enactment into effect, may delegate the power to find facts or to determine the existence or nonexistence of a factual situation or condition on which the operation of a law is made to depend or another agency of the government is to come into existence, provided adequate standards are set forth to guide the agency in so doing. Redevelopment Comm'n v. Security Nat'l Bank, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 595</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 688 (1960); Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973); Bulova Watch Co. v. Brand Distrib. of North Wilkesboro, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 467</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 141 (1974); State v. Lisk, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 474, 204 S.E.2d 868, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 666</cite>, 207 S.E.2d 759 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The General Assembly, having itself declared the policy to be effectuated and having established the broad framework of law within which it is to be accomplished and standards for the guidance of the administrative agency, may delegate to such agency the authority to make determinations of fact upon which the application of a statute to particular situations will depend. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation of Authority to Test Applicants to Bar.
   
   - There is no more appropriate delegation of authority than that of testing to determine a capability to practice law. The Board of Law Examiners is not required to make important policy choices, which might just as easily be made by the elected representatives in the legislature, but merely to compile and administer examinations. Form, grading and logistics only are left to the Board, which does no violence to constitutional principle. Bowens v. Board of Law Exmrs., <cite class="nc_code">57 N.C. App.</cite> 78, 291 S.E.2d 170 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation of Power to Private Corporations.
   
   - The legislature may not vest in a private corporation the authority to determine in its absolute or unguided discretion the price at which another, with whom it has no contractual relation, may sell to a willing buyer an article lawfully acquired and owned by him. Bulova Watch Co. v. Brand Distrib. of North Wilkesboro, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 467</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 141 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "nonsigner" provision of former G.S. 66-56, extending the force and effect of a "fair trade" contract to a seller not a party thereto, was unconstitutional, because it delegated legislative power to a private corporation, in violation of this section. Bulova Watch Co. v. Brand Distrib. of North Wilkesboro, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 467</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 141 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation of Power to Board of Bar Examiners.
   
   - This section does not unconstitutionally delegate legislative power, where the statute authorizes the Board of Law Examiners to make rules governing admission to the bar. Bring v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 655</cite>, 501 S.E.2d 907 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation of Power to Rules Review Commission.
   
   - General Assembly's delegation to the Rules Review Commission of the authority to review and approve State Board of Education rules does not contravene the Board's general rulemaking authority; the General Assembly has delegated review and approval authority to the Commission without violating the separation of powers clause by providing adequate guidance and limiting the Commission's review and approval power. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Review and approval authority delegated to the North Carolina Rules Review Commission is an appropriate delegable power, and the General Assembly has adequately directed the Commission's review of the North Carolina State Board of Education proposed rules and limited the role of the Commission to evaluating those proposed rules to ensure compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        By providing adequate guidelines for rules review, the General Assembly has ensured that the North Carolina Rules Review Commission's authority as it relates to the rules promulgated by the North Carolina State Board of Education is not "arbitrary and unreasoned" and is sufficiently defined to maintain the separation of powers required by the State Constitution. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).

        Delegation of Power to Voters of Municipality.
   
   - While an act, otherwise valid, may be enacted so as to take effect upon approval by a majority of the qualified voters of the affected locality, the General Assembly cannot constitutionally provide that the qualified voters in one governmental unit, e.g., a town, shall decide whether a statute shall be in force and effect elsewhere than in the territory comprising that particular governmental unit.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Incorporation of Municipal Corporations.
   
   - Ordinarily no delegation of legislative functions is involved in general laws providing for the incorporation of municipal corporations, fixing the conditions on which they may be created, and leaving to some officer or official body the duty of determining whether such conditions exist. However if the statute requires or authorizes the court or other agency to pass upon questions of public policy involved, or to exercise any discretion as to whether the municipal corporation should be created, or to render any other assistance than the determination of facts, there is an attempted delegation of legislative power and the statute is invalid. Carolina-Virginia Coastal Hwy. v. Coastal Tpk. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 52</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 310 (1953).

        Power May Be Delegated to Municipalities.
   
   - Ordinary restrictions with respect to the delegation of power to an agency of the State, which exercises no function of government, do not apply to cities, towns, or counties. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's conclusion that a city council improperly circumvented an appeals process in exercising its legislative authority to amend the city's zoning map was erroneous because the enactment of zoning legislation within the limitations imposed by N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1 and the enabling statute was a matter within the legislative authority of the council; nonetheless, the council exceeded its legislative authority by considering a zoning map amendment application that was filed prior to the expiration of the four-month window mandated by Section 14.8 of the Ordinances, which began on the date the council made a final determination that the district would be zoned General Business.

        Delegation to Counties and Municipalities.
   
   - The general rule that legislative power, vested in the General Assembly, may not be delegated is subject to an exception permitting the delegation to municipal corporations and to counties of power to legislate concerning local problems. Porter v. Suburban San. Serv., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 479</cite>, 196 S.E.2d 760 (1973).

       <p>
        Power to Legislate Concerning Local Problems.
   
   - The authority of the General Assembly to delegate to municipal corporations power to legislate concerning local problems, such as zoning, is an exception (established by custom in most, if not all, of the states) to the general rule that legislative powers, vested in the General Assembly by this section, may not be delegated by it. This exception to the doctrine of nondelegation is not limited to a delegation of such legislative authority to incorporated cities and towns, but extends, as to other types of local matters, to a like delegation to counties and other units established by the General Assembly for local government. Jackson v. Guilford County Bd. of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 155</cite>, 166 S.E.2d 78 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Enlargement of Municipal Boundaries.
   
   - There is no constitutional provision prohibiting the creation of a municipality by an act of the General Assembly. A fortiori, by a special act, it may constitutionally enlarge the boundaries of a town which it has created. It may also provide statutory procedures for extending the corporate limits of a municipality organized and existing under the laws of the State. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The enlargement of municipal boundaries by the annexation of new territory, resulting in the extension of municipal corporate jurisdiction, is a legitimate subject of legislation. In the absence of constitutional restriction, the extent to which such legislation shall be enacted, both with respect to the terms and circumstances under which the annexation may be had, and the manner in which it may be made, rests entirely in the discretion of the legislature, and an act of annexation is valid which authorizes the annexation of territory without the consent of its inhabitants. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        In delegating to town commissioners the discretionary right to decide whether to enlarge corporate limits as specified in special act, Session Laws 1971, c. 801, the General Assembly did not delegate legislative authority in violation of N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   6 or this section. Except for approval by the town's board of commissioners, the act was complete in every respect at the time of its ratification. The only discretion given the commissioners was to decide whether or not to annex the territory specified in the act. In authorizing the annexation, the General Assembly determined that the annexation was suitable and proper. Plemmer v. Matthewson, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 722</cite>, 190 S.E.2d 204 (1972).

        Establishment or Abolition of County Court.
   
   - While the legislature may not delegate its power to make laws, it may delegate to local political subdivisions the power to find facts determinative of whether a particular law should become effective in the locality, and therefore it may delegate to county commissioners the power to establish a county court when necessary in the public interest, and, a fortiori it may also delegate to the county commissioners similar authority to abolish a county court established by the legislature.

        Issuance of Special Use Permit.
   
   - Where a municipal ordinance required the board of adjustment to issue a special use permit when it made certain affirmative findings specified in the ordinance, the board's determination of whether to issue a special use permit was not an unlawful exercise of legislative power. Kenan v. Board of Adjustment, <cite class="nc_code">13 N.C. App.</cite> 688, 187 S.E.2d 496, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">281 N.C. 314</cite>, 188 S.E.2d 897 (1972).

       <p>
        Denial of Special Use Permit.
   
   - Where petitioners produced competent, material and substantial prima facie evidence to show their compliance with four general conditions required to obtain a special use permit needed to construct a mobile home park, and where city council failed to make adequate findings of fact to support denial of the special use application, such action constituted an unlawful exercise of legislative power in violation of this section.

       Whole County Provisions.
   
   - The People's insertion of a whole county requirement within their Constitution was not an historical accident. Rather, this provision was inserted by the People as an objective limitation upon the authority of incumbent legislators to redistrict and reapportion in a manner inconsistent with the importance that North Carolinians
   traditionally have placed upon their respective county units in terms of their relationship to State government. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole county provisions of N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   3(3) and 5(3) are interpreted consistent with federal law and reconciled with equal protection requirements under the state Constitution by requiring the formation of single-member districts in North Carolina legislative redistricting plans. The boundaries of such single-member districts, however, may not cross county lines except as outlined in the court's opinion. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Redistricting plan violated the Whole County Provision in N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   3(3) and N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5(3) where one of the counties in question lacked sufficient population to support a non-Voting Rights Act house district; thus, a voting district that included that county had to add population across a county line, but only to the extent necessary to comply with the one-person, one vote standard. Pender County v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 491</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 364 (2007), aff'd, 556 U.S. 1, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 173 L. Ed. 2d 173 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Single and Multi-Member Voting Districts.
   
   - Use of both single-member and multi-member districts within the same redistricting plan violates the equal protection clause of
   the state Constitution unless it is established that inclusion of multi-member districts advances a compelling state interest; hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing, that the use of such districts advances a compelling state interest within the context of a specific, proposed remedial plan. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       While instructive as to how multi-member districts may be used compatibly with "one-person, one-vote" principles, N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   3(3) and 5(3) are not affirmative constitutional mandates and do not authorize use of both single-member and multi-member districts in a manner violative of the fundamental right of each North Carolinian to substantially equal voting power. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Redistricting.
   
   - Redistricting plans did not violate the Equal Protection Clause as they did not impermissibly classify individuals based upon their race because, as to the 26 districts drawn to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, although the three-judge panel erred when it applied strict scrutiny prematurely, there was a compelling state interest in creating districts that would avoid liability under sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act; and because, as to the remaining challenged districts, the predominant factors in their creation were the traditional and permissible redistricting principles encompassed within the mandatory framework as established by precedents of the United States Supreme Court and the North Carolina Supreme Court. Dickson v. Rucho, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 481</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 404 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition on mid-decade redistricting was violated by mid-decade remedial redistricting plans, to the extent changes were not necessary to remedy violations of the Equal Protection Clause. Covington v. North Carolina, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Jan. 19, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       2001 Legislative Redistricting Plans.
   
   - Because the General Assembly enacted its 2001 legislative redistricting plans (Session Laws 2001-458 and 2001-459) in violation of the whole county provisions of N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   3(3) and 5(3), these plans are unconstitutional and are therefore void. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       2002 Legislative Redistricting Plans.
   
   - The North Carolina legislature's 2002 revised redistricting plans were constitutionally deficient in numerous instances; the plans failed to attain strict compliance with the legal requirements set forth in Stephenson I and were unconstitutional. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 301</cite>, 582 S.E.2d 247 (2003).

        Statistical Tests Used in Evaluating State's Efforts at Equal Apportionment.
       </b>
       - The Supreme Court, while rejecting a rigid application of a mathematical formula, has laid down two statistical tests in evaluating the State's "honest and good faith effort to construct districts as nearly of equal population as is practicable." First, the minimum controlling percentage, i.e., the percentage of the State's population which resides in the least populous districts which can elect a majority of each House; and second, the population variance ratio, i.e., the ratio between the most populous district and the least populous district of the State.

       - The equal protection clause requires substantially equal representation for all citizens in a state in each of the two houses of a state bicameral legislature. This right may not be debased by weighing votes differently according to where a citizen happens to reside. Representation in state legislative bodies must be, as nearly as practicable, apportioned on districts of equal population, though mechanical exactness is not required. Political subdivisions may be recognized, but not at the cost of substantial equality among the several districts. Considerations of history, economic or other group interests or area alone do not justify substantial deviations from the equal population concept. Nor will the presence of large numbers of military and military related personnel justify the underrepresentation of an area. Discrimination against a class of individuals, merely because of the nature of their employment, without more being shown, is constitutionally impermissible. Drum v. Seawell, 249 F. Supp. 877 (M.D.N.C. 1965), aff'd, 383 U.S. 831, 86 S. Ct. 1237, 16 L. Ed. 2d 298 (1966), decided under Art. II,

       Whole County Provisions.
   
   - The People's insertion of a whole county requirement within their Constitution was not an historical accident. Rather, this provision was inserted by the People as an objective limitation upon the authority of incumbent legislators to redistrict and reapportion in a manner inconsistent with the importance that North Carolinians
   traditionally have placed upon their respective county units in terms of their relationship to State government. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole county provisions of N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   3(3) and 5(3) are interpreted consistent with federal law and reconciled with equal protection requirements under the state Constitution by requiring the formation of single-member districts in North Carolina legislative redistricting plans. The boundaries of such single-member districts, however, may not cross county lines except as outlined in the court's opinion. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       Redistricting plan violated the Whole County Provision in N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">

   </span>
   3(3) and N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5(3) where one of the counties in question lacked sufficient population to support a non-Voting Rights Act house district; thus, a voting district that included that county had to add population across a county line, but only to the extent necessary to comply with the one-person, one vote standard. Pender County v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 491</cite>, 649 S.E.2d 364 (2007), aff'd, 556 U.S. 1, 129 S. Ct. 1231, 173 L. Ed. 2d 173 (2009).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Single and Multi-Member Voting Districts.
   
   - Use of both single-member and multi-member districts within the same redistricting plan violates the equal protection clause of
   the state Constitution unless it is established that inclusion of multi-member districts advances a compelling state interest; hence the trial court would be directed on remand of action challenging 2001 legislative redistricting plans to afford the opportunity to establish, at an evidentiary hearing, that the use of such districts advances a compelling state interest within the context of a specific, proposed remedial plan. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
      </p>
      <p>
       While instructive as to how multi-member districts may be used compatibly with "one-person, one-vote" principles, N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   3(3) and 5(3) are not affirmative constitutional mandates and do not authorize use of both single-member and multi-member districts in a manner violative of the fundamental right of each North Carolinian to substantially equal voting power. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Redistricting.
   
   - Redistricting plans did not violate the Equal Protection Clause as they did not impermissibly classify individuals based upon their race because, as to the 26 districts drawn to comply with the federal Voting Rights Act of 1965, although the three-judge panel erred when it applied strict scrutiny prematurely, there was a compelling state interest in creating districts that would avoid liability under sections 2 and 5 of the Voting Rights Act; and because, as to the remaining challenged districts, the predominant factors in their creation were the traditional and permissible redistricting principles encompassed within the mandatory framework as established by precedents of the United States Supreme Court and the North Carolina Supreme Court. Dickson v. Rucho, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 481</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 404 (2015).
      </p>
      <p>
       In a racial gerrymandering case, the federal district court clearly erred in overriding the North Carolina General Assembly's redrawing of districts in two counties where no constitutional violation had been found; the district court did not have the authority to disregard the legislature's remedial map based on a finding that the revision violated the North Carolina Constitution's ban on mid-decade redistricting. North Carolina v. Covington, - U.S.
   - , 138 S. Ct. 2548, 201 L. Ed. 2d 993 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition on mid-decade redistricting was violated by mid-decade remedial redistricting plans, to the extent changes were not necessary to remedy violations of the Equal Protection Clause. Covington v. North Carolina, - F. Supp. 2d - (M.D.N.C. Jan. 19, 2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       2001 Legislative Redistricting Plans.
   
   - Because the General Assembly enacted its 2001 legislative redistricting plans (Session Laws 2001-458 and 2001-459) in violation of the whole county provisions of N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §§
   </span>
   3(3) and 5(3), these plans are unconstitutional and are therefore void. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">355 N.C. 354</cite>, 562 S.E.2d 377 (2002).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       2002 Legislative Redistricting Plans.
   
   - The North Carolina legislature's 2002 revised redistricting plans were constitutionally deficient in numerous instances; the plans failed to attain strict compliance with the legal requirements set fort in Stephenson I and were unconstitutional. Stephenson v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 301</cite>, 582 S.E.2d 247 (2003).

   by the presiding officers until three days later, an election in the interim to fill such office was void. State ex rel. Cook v. Meares, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 582</cite>, 21 S.E. 973 (1895).

      <p>
       Ratification Certificates Are Conclusive as to Compliance.
   
   - When an act is certified to by the speakers as having been ratified, it is conclusive of the fact that it was read three several times in each house and ratified. Union Bank v. Commissioners of Oxford, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 214</cite>, 25 S.E. 966 (1896).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ratification certificates signed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House are conclusive of the fact that the bill was read three times and was passed three times in each house of the General Assembly. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The signature is conclusive of passage
   
   according to this section. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Journals of the House and Senate are not competent to contradict the certificates
   
   of the presiding officers that a bill was duly read in each house three times and passed on each legislative reading. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).

       The additional steps necessary to show the passage of revenue acts are not within the conclusive presumption arising from the certificates of the presiding officers. The journals are made the exclusive sources of such proof. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).

        Act Is Void Unless Section Is Followed.
   
   - An act not passed with the formalities required by this section is void, and confers no authority upon a city to create a debt and issue the bonds therein provided for. City of Charlotte v. E.D. Shepard &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 602</cite>, 29 S.E. 842 (1898); Glenn v. Wray, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 730</cite>, 36 S.E. 167 (1900); Cottrell v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicability of This Section to Statutes Imposing a Tax.
   
   - It is well established law in this State that when determining the constitutional validity of a statute, if the meaning is clear from reading the words of the Constitution, courts should not search for a meaning elsewhere. The language of this section is clear in that it applies to statutes enacted to impose a tax. North Carolina E. Mun. Power v. Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 398 S.E.2d 486 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 270</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 838 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying state agencies' motion to dismiss a corporation's complaint, seeking a declaratory judgment that an E-Procurement fee was a tax not enacted by the legislature in violation of N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 and a refund of the taxes under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia09s105-267" target="_blank">G.S. 105-267</a></cite> because the corporation's claims were barred by the defense of sovereign immunity; the North Carolina Supreme Court's holding that sovereign immunity could not prevent a plaintiff from asserting a claim alleging a violation of his rights under the Declaration of Rights of the North Carolina Constitution was limited to alleged violations of personal rights and did not extend to the corporation's complaint because N.C. Const., Art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   23 did not articulate any rights, only procedures to be followed. Petroleum Traders Corp. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. App.</cite> 542, 660 S.E.2d 662 (2008).
   <br />

        Inapplicability to Session Laws 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988), <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.1052.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1052</a></cite>.
   
   - There is no doubt that the effect of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.1052.html" target="_blank">Chapter 1052</a></cite> of Session Laws 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988) imposed a greater tax burden on plaintiff for 1988. However, this section focuses on the purpose of the statute (to impose a tax) and not the result of the statute (an increased tax burden). Chapter 1052 of Session Laws 1987 (Reg. Sess., 1988) neither imposes a tax nor authorizes its imposition, and therefore, this section does not apply. North Carolina E. Mun. Power v. Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 398 S.E.2d 486 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 270</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 838 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If an act is not a revenue or tax act from the outset, it does not matter if the act is retroactive
   
   or prospective in its application. North Carolina E. Mun. Power v. Wake County, <cite class="nc_code">100 N.C. App.</cite> 693, 398 S.E.2d 486 (1990), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 270</cite>, 407 S.E.2d 838 (1991).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicability to Townships.
   
   - The restrictions are by necessary implication applicable to townships, as they are but constituent parts of the county organization. Wittkowsky v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 90</cite>, 63 S.E. 275 (1908); Township Rd. Comm'n v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 61</cite>, 100 S.E. 122 (1919).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a town charter is not passed in accordance with this section,
   
   such town cannot levy any tax under said charter, but it may levy taxes for necessary expense. Rodman-Heath Cotton Mills v. Town of Waxhaw, <cite class="nc_code">130 N.C. 293</cite>, 41 S.E. 488 (1902).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Section Not Applicable to Necessary County Expense.
   
   - It is not necessary to enter the yeas and nays on an act to raise revenue for a necessary county expense. Black v. Commissioners of Buncombe County, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 121</cite>, 39 S.E. 818 (1901).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Issuing bonds for road purposes is a necessary expense
   
   to which the section does not apply. Leonard v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 527</cite>, 117 S.E. 580 (1923). See Woodall v. Western Wake Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 377</cite>, 97 S.E. 226 (1918).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An act authorizing treasurer to deliver State bonds
   
   is not within this section. Battle v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 573</cite>, 64 S.E. 505 (1909).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Effect on Bonds of Failure to Comply with Section.
        </b>
        - This section is mandatory, and, not having been complied with in the passage of certain laws authorizing certain counties to subscribe for stock in a railroad company and issue bonds in payment therefor, bonds issued by a city pursuant thereto were void. Burlingham v. City of New Bern, 213 F. 1014 (E.D.N.C. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        A town may not pledge its faith or credit for the issuance of bonds for municipal purposes, unless under statutory authority is given in conformity with the requirements of this section, or unless for necessary expenses. Storm v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 679</cite>, 128 S.E. 17 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An act of the legislature authorizing a bond issue for public roads
   
   is valid if conforming to this section of the State Constitution, without submitting the proposition to a vote of the people. Hargrave v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 626</cite>, 84 S.E. 1044 (1915).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of interest does not preclude inquiry as to the validity of the bonds.
   
   Glenn v. Wray, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 730</cite>, 36 S.E. 167 (1900).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Township Not Estopped to Deny Invalidity of Bonds.
   
   - Where township bonds are invalid because issued without authority, the township is not estopped from asserting such fact by recitals in the bonds that they are issued in compliance with the Constitution and laws of the State. Debnam v. Chitty, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. 657</cite>, 43 S.E. 3 (1902), overruled on other grounds, Board of Comm'rs v. Wachovia Loan &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 110</cite>, 55 S.E. 442 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Who May Enjoin Bond Issue.
   
   - It is competent for a taxpayer to file a complaint on behalf of himself and all other taxpayers in the State to enjoin the issue of State bonds under an unconstitutional act of Assembly. Galloway v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 147</cite> (1869).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Changing of County Tax Agencies.
   
   - The legislature has the power and authority to change the county tax agencies without further observing the requirements of this section. State ex rel. O'Neal v. Jennette, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 96</cite>, 129 S.E. 184 (1925).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Tolls and Taxes Distinguished.
   
   - Taxes are levied for the support of government, and their amount is regulated by its necessities. Tolls are compensation for the use of another's property or for improvements which have been made, and their amount is determined by the cost of the property or improvements. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tolls are not taxes. A person uses a toll road at his option; if he does not use it, he pays no toll. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because tolls do not constitute a tax within the meaning of the Constitution, the limitations of N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   8 and N.C. Const. art. II,
   <span class="s1">

   23 do not apply. Wideni77 v. N.C. DOT, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 390, 800 S.E.2d 441, review denied, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 223</cite>, 804 S.E.2d 543, 2017 N.C. LEXIS 762 (2017).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Turnpike Authority Bonds Not Debt within Meaning of Constitution.
   
   - The General Assembly has taken great care to make it crystal clear that the credit of neither the State nor any of its political subdivisions can be pledged to pay the Turnpike Authority's revenue bonds. This method of financing creates no debt within the meaning of the Constitution. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute for the revaluation of property
   
   is not in its strict sense a revenue act within the meaning of this section. Hart v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">192 N.C. 161</cite>, 134 S.E. 403 (1926).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The filing fee required by the primary law
   
   is in no sense a tax within the meaning of this section. McLean v. Durham County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 6</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 842 (1942).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A bailment surcharge imposed on each case of distilled spirits
   
   shipped from ABC warehouse to ABC stores is not a tax; the cost of liquor enforcement is a burden incident to the privilege of buying spirituous liquors in the state and such a surcharge is not unconstitutional as a tax imposed in violation of this section or of N.C. Const., Art. V,

         II. JOURNALS AND CERTIFICATES.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        <b>
         What Journals Must Show.
        </b>
        - The journal must show who voted for the bill, and that the requisite number of Senators and members did so, and no other source of evidence can be invoked; the certificate of the presiding officers that a bill has been read three times does not obviate the necessity of examining the journal. Burlingham v. City of New Bern, 213 F. 1014 (E.D.N.C. 1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Showing of Nays.
   
   - As this section requires that on the voting of a bill before the legislature the yeas and nays shall be entered on the journals, either the nays must be on the journal, or it must affirmatively appear that there were none. Commissioners of New Hanover County v. DeRosset, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 275</cite>, 40 S.E. 43 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the House journal showed that a certain law, authorizing the issuance of county bonds, was passed by the following vote: "Ayes 94, nays . . .; total . . .", such record sufficiently showed that there was no negative vote cast, under the presumption that the Clerk of the House charged with the recording of the vote performed his duty, and hence such record constituted a sufficient compliance with this section. Board of Comm'rs v. Tollman, 145 F. 753 (4th Cir. 1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        A bill to authorize a county to pledge its faith and credit by issuing bonds for road purposes, duly ratified, was not invalid for failure to meet the requirements of this section, by reason of the failure to record on the journal on the second reading in one of the branches of the legislature the "no" vote, when it was made to appear from the entries of the names of those voting in the affirmative that a majority of the voters had so voted, the absence of the entries of the names of those voting in the negative showing that there were none. Leonard v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 527</cite>, 117 S.E. 580 (1923), citing Board of Comm'rs v. Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">143 N.C. 110</cite>, 55 S.E. 442 (1906).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Journals Conclusive.
   
   - The journals are conclusive as against not only a printed statute published by authority of law, but also against a duly enrolled act. Union Bank v. Commissioners of Oxford, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 214</cite>, 25 S.E. 966 (1896); Commissioners of Stanly County v. Snuggs, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 394</cite>, 28 S.E. 539 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        The journals are the sole evidence as to whether the ayes and noes on a vote on a bill were entered on such journals. Commissioners of New Hanover County v. De Rosset, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 275</cite>, 40 S.E. 43 (1901); Allen v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 453</cite>, 107 S.E. 463 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        The journals of the General Assembly, when competent as evidence, import absolute verity, and cannot be explained or altered by parol evidence. Wilson v. Markley, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 616</cite>, 45 S.E. 1023 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution requires that it should appear, not from the entries on the original bill, but from the journal, that the bill was properly read and the necessary entry of yeas and nays was made. If the journal should show that the bill was properly passed, no evidence will be received to contradict what is therein recorded. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Certificates of Ratification Not Proof.
   
   - With respect to the requirements in this section, the House and Senate journals, and not the certificates of ratification signed by the presiding officers, are the sources of proof as to whether the bill was read on three several days in each house of the General Assembly and passed three several readings on three different days and that the yeas and nays on the second and third readings were entered on the journals. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The additional steps necessary to show the passage of revenue acts are not within the conclusive presumption arising from the certificates of the presiding officers. The journals are made the exclusive sources of such proof. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Certificates of Ratification.
   
   - The usual certificate of ratification is conclusive only of the fact of ratification, but not of a compliance with this section of the Constitution. Smathers v. Commissioners of Madison County, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 480</cite>, 34 S.E. 554 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        The certificate of the speakers of each house of the legislature is conclusive evidence that a bill was read and passed three several readings in each house. Commissioners of New Hanover County v. DeRossett, <cite class="nc_code">129 N.C. 275</cite>, 40 S.E. 43 (1901).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Correction of Journals.
   
   - A subsequent special session of the same legislature may correct its journals of the regular session so as to show in point of fact that a bill of this character was properly passed in accordance with these provisions. Commissioners of Richmond County v. Farmers Bank, <cite class="nc_code">152 N.C. 387</cite>, 67 S.E. 969 (1910).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where journal of the Senate affirmatively showed that first and second readings took place on the same day,
   
   the act was unconstitutional. Storm v. Town of Wrightsville Beach, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 679</cite>, 128 S.E. 17 (1925).

         III. SUBSTITUTIONS AND AMENDMENTS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        When Amendment Will Affect Constitutionality.
   
   - An act passed in accordance with this section is not rendered invalid by an amendment not passed in accordance with the constitutional provision when the amendment does not affect the taxing or other financial features of the act, increase either the taxes, or impose any additional burden on the taxpayer. Wagstaff v. Central Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 377</cite>, 93 S.E. 908 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Passage of Material Amendments.
   
   - A material amendment made by one branch of the legislature to a bill passed by the other, allowing a county to pledge its credit in issuing bonds for the improvement of the highways therein, must be concurred in according to the requirements of this section. Glenn v. Wray, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 730</cite>, 36 S.E. 167 (1900); Claywell v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 657</cite>, 92 S.E. 481 (1917). See also, Guire v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 516</cite>, 99 S.E. 430 (1919), as to amendment by separate act.
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Passage of Immaterial Amendments.
   
   - When an act has been passed in accordance with this section, an amendment which does not increase the amount of the bonds or the taxes to be levied or otherwise materially change the original bill may be adopted by the concurrence of both houses of the General Assembly. Board of Comm'rs v. F.M. Stafford &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 453</cite>, 50 S.E. 862 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        An amendment which does not increase the amount of the bonds or tax to be levied, or otherwise materially change the bill is immaterial. Gregg v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 479</cite>, 78 S.E. 301 (1913).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        It is only when a material amendment is affected that rereading is necessary.
   
   Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Presumption of Materiality of Amendment.
   
   - Where the journal does not show the effect of the amendment, there is no presumption that it was material. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of Materiality.
   
   - Slips of paper attached by a rubber band to the cover of the original bill when it was engrossed were not admissible in determining whether an amendment was material. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Materiality a Judicial Question.
   
   - Whether an amendment is material and required to be passed in accordance with this section is a question of law for the court, under the facts, and is not controlled by an agreement between the parties. Wagstaff v. Central Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">174 N.C. 377</cite>, 93 S.E. 908 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Validation by Later Act.
   
   - Where a statute, pledging the faith and credit of the State in issuing State bonds, has not been passed in accordance with the provisions of this section and is therefore invalid, its invalidity may be cured by a later statute passed as the Constitution requires, referring to the former statute, and supplying the omissions, and the bonds thereunder issued after the question has been submitted to and approved by the voters of the State, as the statute required, are valid. Hinton v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 496</cite>, 137 S.E. 669 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Change in Caption.
   
   - A slightly different caption retaining the number of the original bill was an immaterial amendment. Brown v. Road Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 598</cite>, 92 S.E. 502 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Substitution of Name of Commissioner.
   
   - An amendment in the second branch of the legislature substituting the name of a commissioner does not broaden the scope of the act or affect its financial feature, and the failure in the first branch to comply with this section will not alone affect its validity. Brown v. Road Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 598</cite>, 92 S.E. 502 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Curtailing Territory to Which Indebtedness Applied.
   
   - An act empowering special school districts of the State to issue bonds, which followed the requirements of this section except that upon its last reading, by amendment, it was made to apply only to one district in the State, the effect of the amendment being to exclude the other districts, and the act being regularly enacted as to the one district retained, was valid as to that district. Gregg v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">162 N.C. 479</cite>, 78 S.E. 301 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a bill was introduced in one branch of the legislature for the issuance of bonds, and amendments were made by the other branch, withdrawing certain of the more wealthy and popular townships from the liability for the indebtedness to be created, except under condition requiring the approval of the voters, the amendment was a material one, requiring for the validity of the act that it be passed in accordance with the requirements of this section. Claywell v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 657</cite>, 92 S.E. 481 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Substitution of Tax Bill.
   
   - Where a bill authorizing a levy of taxes for road purposes was read and referred to a committee, and the committee recommended a substitute, resulting in the tabling of the original bill and the passing of the substitute on two separate days in that branch of the legislature, and otherwise conforming to the requirements of this section, in both branches, the substitute would be regarded, in the contemplation of the Constitution, as an amendment to the original bill introduced, and the act could not successfully be questioned as not having passed on the several separate days required of a bill of this character. Edwards v. Nash County Bd. of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 58</cite>, 110 S.E. 600 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Increase in Tax Rate.
   
   - When an act was passed by the legislature authorizing a graded school district to vote on the question of issuing school bonds in a certain amount, and amended at a subsequent session so as to authorize bonds to a larger amount and to run a longer time, both acts having been passed upon their several readings, with aye and no vote according to this section, an issue of bonds under a still later and similar act for a larger amount and upon a greater rate of taxation was invalid in toto when the later act was not likewise passed in accordance with this section. Russell v. Town of Troy, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. 366</cite>, 74 S.E. 1021 (1912).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Increase in Interest Rate on Bonds.
   
   - An amendment to an act authorizing a county to issue bonds for road construction, which increases the rate of interest from 5% to 6%, involved material change in the former law. Guire v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">177 N.C. 516</cite>, 99 S.E. 430 (1919).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a municipal charter authorizing issuance of bonds was subsequently amended
   
   with regard thereto, but upon condition that the proposition be submitted to the voters, which was never done, and the legislature attempted to pass a still later law amending the former act but not in accordance with the requirements of this section, the later acts were of no effect, leaving the charter of the town as to these provisions open, under the terms of which the bonds could yet be issued. Cottrell v. Town of Lenoir, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 138</cite>, 91 S.E. 827 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsequent Act Requiring Referendum on Bond Issue.
   
   - Where the legislature passed an act authorizing a county to pledge its faith and credit in the issuance of bonds upon its several readings, upon its aye and no vote in accordance with this section, and by later ratification of an act requires the question to be submitted to the qualified voters, it was not necessary that the later ratified act also be passed in accordance with the constitutional requirement, and thus, in the absence of a proper election, the bond issue would be declared invalid. Graham County v. W.K. Terry &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 22</cite>, 138 S.E. 443 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the legislature passed an act authorizing a county to issue bonds according to the provisions of this section, it was within its power to add a provision that the question be first submitted to the electorate of the county. Graham County v. W.K. Terry &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 22</cite>, 138 S.E. 443 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An amendment which made a material change in the valid act it proposed to amend
   
   was unconstitutional, and the commissioners were without authority to levy the tax specified in the later act. Township Rd. Comm'n v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 61</cite>, 100 S.E. 122 (1919).

       <p>
        Purpose of Section.
   
   - This section is remedial in its nature and was intended not only to free the legislature of petty detail but also to require uniform and coordinated action under general laws in regard to the matters therein stipulated which are related to the welfare of the people of the whole State; and the application of the section should not be denied on any unsubstantial distinction which would defeat its purpose. Board of Health v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">220 N.C. 140</cite>, 16 S.E.2d 677 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In adopting this section, the people were motivated by the desire that the General Assembly should legislate for North Carolina in respect to the subjects specified as a single united commonwealth rather than as a conglomeration of innumerable discordant communities. To prevent this laudable desire from degenerating into a mere pious hope, they decreed in emphatic and express terms that any local, private, or special act or resolution passed in violation of the provisions of this section shall be void, no matter how praiseworthy or wise such local, private, or special act or resolution may be. Idol v. Street, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 730</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 313 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the purpose of this section to free the General Assembly from the enormous amount of petty detail which had been occupying its attention, to enable it to devote more time and attention to general legislation of statewide interest and concern, to strengthen local self-government by providing for the delegation of local matters by general laws to local authorities, and to require uniform and coordinated action under general laws on matters related to the welfare of the whole State. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section was to relieve the General Assembly from the necessity of passing on laws relating to certain specified matters in which only a small territory or a few persons were concerned, and to thereby enable members of the General Assembly to devote their time and attention to the enactment of legislation important to the entire State. Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967); Town of Emerald Isle ex rel. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 640</cite>, 360 S.E.2d 756 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the purpose of this section to free the General Assembly from the enormous amount of petty detail which had been occupying its attention, to enable it to devote more time and attention to general legislation of statewide interest and concern, to strengthen local self-government by providing for the delegation of local matters by general laws to local authorities, and to require uniform and coordinated action under general laws on matters related to the welfare of the whole State of North Carolina. Williams v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 170</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 415 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Section.
   
   - The modification wrought by this section is that now a local, private or special act, dealing with designated subjects, is void as violative of this section. State v. Chestnutt, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 401</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 297 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional prohibition against local acts simply commands that when legislating in certain specified fields, the General Assembly must make rational distinctions among units of local government which are reasonably related to the purpose of the legislation. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although North Carolina is not a home rule jurisdiction, and although the North Carolina Constitution, consistent with the language of N.C. Const. art. VII,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1, gives the General Assembly exceedingly broad authority over the "powers and duties" delegated to local governments, that authority is subject to limitations imposed by other constitutional provisions, including the limitations set out in N.C. Const. art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24, barring local laws on certain prohibited subjects, which is the fundamental law of North Carolina and may not be ignored. City of Asheville v. State, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 80</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 759 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An act is not invalid merely because it is local
   
   unless it violates some constitutional provision. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not forbid local acts passed in the exercise of delegated police power if they do not relate to the matters therein prohibited. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutionality of Statutes Supplementing General Laws.
   
   - Statutes which do not directly contravene this section, but supplement general laws and policy, or aid in administering or financing policy established by general law, are not unconstitutional, especially when the administrative unit is local in nature. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prospective Effect of Statute's Unconstitutionality.
   
   - Where defendants reasonably relied on invalid statute and acted in good faith in carrying out the mandate of the General Assembly, the trial court did not err by directing the effect of the statute's unconstitutionality to have only a prospective application. City of New Bern v. New Bern-Craven County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 98, 437 S.E.2d 655 (1993), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">338 N.C. 430</cite>, 450 S.E.2d 735 (1994).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As to the scope of legislative power,
   
   see Webb v. Port Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 663</cite>, 172 S.E. 377 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute is either "general" or "local";
   
   there is no middle ground. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967); Smith v. County of Mecklenburg, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 497</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 67 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable Classification Test.
   
   - When an employer claimed that a county ordinance regulating employment discrimination and the enabling legislation allowing its enactment were invalid local acts which regulated labor and trade, the appropriate test to apply in determining whether the legislation in question was general or local was the reasonable classification test. Williams v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, <cite class="nc_code">357 N.C. 170</cite>, 581 S.E.2d 415 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in North Carolina's N.C. Const. art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24 jurisprudence suggests that courts should focus on a hypothetical, rather than actual, justification for challenged legislation in determining whether the legislation should be deemed general or local in nature, and a decision to approve the use of a hypothetical purpose approach would deprive N.C. Const. art. II,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   24 of any meaningful effect by rendering the provision indistinguishable from the substantive due process provisions of N.C. Const. art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   19. City of Asheville v. State, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 80</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 759 (2016).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The distinguishing factors between a valid general law and a prohibited local act
   
   are the related elements of reasonable classification and uniform application. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        What Are General Laws.
   
   - For a law to be general, it is only required that the objects of its operation be reasonably classified. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes relating to persons or things as a class are general laws. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        A law is general if it applies to and operates uniformly on all the members of any class of persons, places, or things requiring legislation peculiar to itself in matters covered by the law. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        A general law defines a class which reasonably warrants special legislative attention and applies uniformly to everyone in the class. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A law is general if any rational basis reasonably related to the objective of the legislation can be identified which justifies the separation of units of local government into included and excluded categories. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Classifications Within General Laws.
   
   - Classifications must be general within the limits of the subject matter. They must be reasonable, and the statute must affect all within the class uniformly. Classifications must not be arbitrary or capricious, but must be natural and intrinsic and based on substantial differences. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Classification must be reasonable and germane to the law. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Classification must not be discriminatory, arbitrary or capricious. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Classification must be based on a reasonable and tangible distinction and operate the same on all parts of the State under the same conditions and circumstances. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Classification does not render a statute "local" if the classification is reasonable and based on rational difference of situation or condition. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967); Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        While substantial distinctions are essential in classification, the distinctions need not be scientific or exact. The legislature has wide discretion in making classifications. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Universality is immaterial
   
   so long as those affected are reasonably different from those excluded and, for the purpose of the statute, there is a logical basis for treating them in a different manner. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no constitutional requirement that a regulation must reach every class
   
   to which it might be applied - that the legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none. It is enough that the present statute strikes at the evil where it is felt, and reaches the class of cases where it most frequently occurs. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        What Are Local Acts.
   
   - A local act is one operating only in a limited territory or specified locality. Idol v. Street, <cite class="nc_code">233 N.C. 730</cite>, 65 S.E.2d 313 (1951); Carolina-Virginia Coastal Hwy. v. Coastal Tpk. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 52</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 310 (1953); Board of Managers of James Walker Mem. Hosp. v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 179</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 749 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the persons or things subject to the law are not reasonably different from those excluded, the statute is local or special. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "local law" means, primarily at least, a law that in fact, if not in form, is confined within territorial limits other than that of the whole State, or applies to any political subdivision or subdivisions of the State less than the whole, or to the property and persons of a limited portion of the State, or to a comparatively small portion of the State, or is directed to a specific locality or spot, as distinguished from a law which operates generally throughout the State. McIntyre v. Clarkson, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 510</cite>, 119 S.E.2d 888 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        A law is local where, by force of an inherent limitation, it arbitrarily separates some places from others upon which, but for such limitation, it would operate, and where it embraces less than the entire class of places to which such legislation would be necessary or appropriate, having regard to the purpose for which the legislation was designed, and where classification does not rest on circumstances distinguishing the places included from those excluded. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        A local act is an act applying to fewer than all counties, in which the affected counties do not rationally differ from the excepted counties in relation to the purpose of the act. Smith v. County of Mecklenburg, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 497</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 67 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        A local act is one which unreasonably singles out a class for special legislative attention, or which, having made a reasonable classification, does not apply uniformly to all members of the designated class. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

   - Determination of whether a statute is a local one prohibited by this section should be largely left to the facts and circumstances of each particular case, giving significance to the rule that legislative acts are presumed to have been rightfully passed from proper motives, and that a classification of this kind, when made by them, should not be disturbed unless it is manifestly arbitrary and invalid. In re Harris, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 633</cite>, 112 S.E. 425 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether an enactment is a general law, legislative intent must be found from the language of the act, its legislative history, and the circumstances surrounding its adoption which throw light upon the evil sought to be remedied and the actual purpose to be accomplished. In re Indian Hills, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 659</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 909 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts Look Beyond Form of Statutes.
   
   - In determining whether a statute relating to matters enumerated in this section is a "local, private, or special" act inhibited by this section or a "general law" which the General Assembly has the power to pass, the courts will look beyond the form of the act and ascertain whether the statute, in fact, is generally and usually applicable throughout the area comprising the State. State v. Dixon, <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. 161</cite>, 1 S.E.2d 521 (1939); In re Indian Hills, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 659</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 909 (1972).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that a statute applies only to certain units of local government
   
   does not by itself render the statute a prohibited local act. Only if the statutory classification is unreasonable or under-inclusive will the statute be voided as a prohibited local act. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The number of counties included or excluded
   
   is not necessarily determinative. Conceivably, a statute may be local if it excludes only one county. On the other hand, it may be general if it includes only one or a few counties. It is a matter of classification. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965); Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute applicable to a single city, without reasonable distinction
   
   between such city and other cities or towns for the purpose of classification, is a local act. Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Annexation Provisions.
   
   - Sections 160A-45 et seq. do not violate this section, which prohibits the General Assembly from enacting "any local, private, or special act or resolution" in regard to certain enumerated subjects. This constitutional provision does not apply to annexation proceedings by municipalities, since N.C. Const., Art. VII,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1 authorizes the General Assembly "except as otherwise prohibited by this Constitution" to "give such powers and duties to counties, cities, and towns and other governmental subdivisions as it may deem advisable," and no other provision of the Constitution prohibits the General Assembly from enacting special legislation for the annexation of areas by municipalities. Campbell v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. App.</cite> 252, 319 S.E.2d 323, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">312 N.C. 492</cite>, 322 S.E.2d 553 (1984).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Act Reviving a Town Charter.
   
   - An Act purporting to revive a town, which local citizens attacked, arguing that the new town contained fewer acres than the "true" town, did not violate this provision, because the Act was not a prohibited local act. Bethania Town Lot Comm. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 664</cite>, 502 S.E.2d 360 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporate Boundaries.
   
   - Act which decreased the corporate boundaries of town was constitutional and plaintiffs were time-barred from asserting any further challenges. Bethania Town Lot Comm. v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 783, 486 S.E.2d 729 (1997).

       </p>
       <p>
        National Park.
   
   - The provision of Laws 1927, c. 48, for the acquisition of lands for a national park affects the interest of the people of the State, and though local as to location, was for a public use in contemplation of its acquisition by the State for the purpose outlined in the act.

        Filing Fee in Primary Elections.
   
   - In no sense is the filing fee required of candidates in primary elections a local law as condemned by this section. McLean v. Durham County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">222 N.C. 6</cite>, 21 S.E.2d 842 (1942).

       <p>
        Session Laws 1967, c. 506,

        General laws regulating the change of a person's name,
   
   and prescribing a procedure therefor, do not abrogate the common-law rule which allows a person to change his name without resort to legal procedure or repeal it by implication or otherwise; they merely affirm and are in aid of the common-law rule and provide an additional method of effecting a change of name and, more importantly, provide a method for recording the change.

        Consolidation of City and County Health Departments.
   
   - Session Laws 1945, c. 86, which attempted to authorize Forsyth County and Winston-Salem to consolidate their health departments and name a joint city-county board of health and appoint joint city-county health officers, and which expressly repealed to the extent of any conflict all laws in conflict therewith, was a local act relating to health, and was void for repugnancy to this section.

       <p>
        Local Health and Sanitation Acts.
   
   - Acts held to be "local," and related to "health" and "sanitation," were prohibited subjects of legislation and therefore unconstitutional. City of New Bern v.

        Creation and Naming of County Health Board.
   
   - Public-Local Laws of 1931, c. 322, which undertook to create and name the members of a county board of health for Madison County alone, which board was charged with the duty of inspecting county institutions and seeing that they were kept in a sanitary condition, and selecting a physician to vaccinate against disease, was a local act relating to health and sanitation prohibited by this section.

        Authorization of Care of Indigent Sick and Afflicted Poor.
   
   - An act which authorized the city and county to make provisions for "the hospitalization, medical attention, and care of the indigent sick and afflicted poor" of the city and county alone was a local act relating to health, and void as in direct conflict with this section. Board of Managers v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 179</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 749 (1953).

        Erection of Hospital.
   
   - An act authorizing a certain county to erect a tuberculosis hospital, issue bonds therefor, and provide a tax for its maintenance, upon the approval of the voters, was both a special and local act and void under this section.

Sess., 1986), c. 818, s. 3, that act was not a local act in violation of this section, since it did not subject the annexed area to a different treatment than it would have faced if the city had annexed the area under the general annexation law, but assured that it would receive the same treatment.

        Inspections pursuant to the State Building Code affect health and sanitation;
   
   thus acts that altered the legislative directive of G.S. 160A-411, that the city shall determine who will perform the inspections under the Code, were local legislation that shifted responsibility for enforcement of laws affecting the health of the public, and were barred under this section of the Constitution.

        Sewer and Water Service for School Children.
   
   - Session Laws 1951, c. 1075, was a local or special act. It related only to Randolph County, and in Randolph County affected only a single agency, the county board of education. It related to health and sanitation, since its sole purpose was to prescribe provisions with respect to sewer and water service for local school children in Randolph County. It purported to limit the power of the county board of education to provide for sanitation and healthful conditions in the schools by means of a sewerage system and an adequate water supply. These things being true, this statute was invalid under the mandatory terms of this section. Lamb v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 377</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 201 (1952).

        Formation of Sewerage Districts.

        Creation of Sanitary District.
   
   - Private Laws 1927, c. 229, attempting to create a sanitary district within certain lines within a county for the construction and maintenance of sewer and water systems, with certain assessments or taxing powers for the purpose, was void, being in violation of the provisions of this section. Drysdale v. Prudden, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 722</cite>, 143 S.E. 530 (1928).

        Direction to Sheriff to Dispose of Cattle in a Particular Area.
   
   - Session Laws 1959, c. 782, which related solely to the segment of the outer banks in Carter County between Beaufort Inlet and Ocracoke Inlet, and purported to authorize and direct the sheriff of Carteret County, without judicial inquiry of any kind, to remove and dispose of all cattle, etc., in this particular area, was a local act relating to the abatement of a public nuisance, and was unconstitutional and void as violative of this section.

   - This section applies only to a local act which authorizes the laying out, opening, altering, or discontinuing of a given particular and designated highway, street, or alley. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Streets Within City Limits.
   
   - The unlimited power in the General Assembly to provide for the creation and extension of corporate limits of municipal corporations would seem to include the right to vest in such municipal corporations the authority to levy taxes to lay out and maintain highways and streets within such limits, since they are essential to the existence of such corporations, and such private act would not seem to contravene this section. Matthews v. Town of Blowing Rock, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 450</cite>, 177 S.E. 429 (1934).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Improvement of Streets and Alleys.
   
   - Local acts relating to the improvement of streets and alleys generally in a city or town, and authorizing the assessment of the cost thereof against the abutting property, do not conflict with this section, although unquestionably an act purporting to authorize the laying out of particular streets or highways, or to authorize the maintenance of a designated street or streets, or the discontinuance thereof, would be repugnant to this section. In re Resolutions Passed by City Council, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 494</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 171 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsequent Local Law Increasing Authority Granted to City Before Effective Date of Section.
   
   - Where a local statute giving a municipality power to improve its streets and assess abutting owners for a part of the cost was enacted prior to the effective date of this section, a subsequent local law which merely increased the jurisdiction and authority granted to the city in regard to such improvements did not violate the constitutional proscription. City of Goldsboro v. Atlantic C.L.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 216</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 125 (1954).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Maintenance of County Highways.
   
   - A public-local law applicable to the maintenance of the public highways of a county and authorizing taxation or issuance of bonds for this purpose, with certain specific supervision and control, is not such local or special act as falls within the inhibition of this section, where it does not affect the "laying out, opening, altering, maintaining or discontinuing" the then existing highways, etc. State v. Kelly, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 365</cite>, 119 S.E. 755 (1923).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        County Subdivision Ordinances.
   
   - The statutory provisions of former G.S. 153-266.3 and former G.S. 153-266.4 as to what could and what had to be included in a county subdivision ordinance, did not constitute "authorizing the laying out, opening, altering, maintaining, or discontinuing of highways, streets, or alleys" within the meaning of this section. State v. McBane, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 60</cite>, 170 S.E.2d 913 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Board for Control of County Roads.
   
   - A statute that abolishes two boards of road commissioners in a county and gives to another board, created by the same act, entire control and management of the public roads and bridges of the county, does not violate this section. Huneycutt v. Board of Rd. Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 319</cite>, 109 S.E. 4 (1921).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A public-local law authorizing county commissioners to take over a specified highway
   
   within the county, constituting one of the principal highways within the county, connecting two important State highways, transferring to the said commissioners the bridges of the various townships for their care and supervision, was not violative of this section. Hill v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 123</cite>, 129 S.E. 154 (1925). See Thomson v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 662</cite>, 184 S.E. 490 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Issuance of County Road Bonds.
   
   - An act of the legislature authorizing the issuance of county bonds for public roads is not in contravention of this section of the Constitution. Commissioners of Surry County v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 170</cite>, 100 S.E. 421 (1919); Board of Managers v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 179</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 749 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        An act of the legislature authorizing the road commissioners of a county to issue bonds, upon the approval of its electors, to obtain moneys for the expenditure upon certain particularly designated objects in respect to its public roads, which does not contain any provision for the laying out, altering or discontinuing any road or highway, does not contravene this section. Road Comm'rs v. Bank of Ashe, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 347</cite>, 107 S.E. 245 (1921).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distribution of Bond Proceeds.
   
   - An act of the legislature may prescribe a rule by which the proceeds of the sales of bonds which it authorizes a county to issue for road purposes shall be disbursed and distributed in order to effect the best results, when it is confined to the control and management of the funds, and leaves to the local authorities the power given them by this section over "the laying out, opening, or discontinuance of highways." Board of Comm'rs v. Pruden &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 394</cite>, 100 S.E. 695 (1919).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Act Closing Certain Public Roads.
   
   - Where part of the land in a private development was added to the playground of a public school, and the General Assembly, by private act (Private Laws of 1933, c. 72), declared that certain roads dedicated in the registered plot of the development were no longer needed and that the roads should be closed and added to the playground space for the school, this act was void as being a private or special act inhibited by this section. Glenn v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 525</cite>, 185 S.E. 781 (1936).
   <br />

       <p>
        Act Authorizing Construction of Toll Roads and Bridges in Five Counties Only.
   
   - An act which authorized the construction and operation of toll roads and toll bridges within only five counties of the State was repugnant to this section and was therefore void. Carolina-Virginia Coastal Hwy. v. Coastal Tpk. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">237 N.C. 52</cite>, 74 S.E.2d 310 (1953).

   - While authority given by statute to a county or other political agency of a state to issue bonds for highways in aid to their maintenance or construction is not direct, local, or special legislation as is prohibited by this section, it is otherwise where the statute directs the building of a bridge at a specified place across a stream between two counties, and as an incident permits the issuance of bonds or the levying of taxes for the purpose, pledging the faith and credit of the State.

        Local Laws Establishing or Changing Lines of School Districts Prohibited.
   
   - Since the enforcement of this section, special acts of the legislature to establish or change the lines, etc., of a school district, and any proceedings under it, are null and void. Galloway v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 245</cite>, 114 S.E. 165 (1922).

       </p>
       <p>
        Meaning of "School District".
   
   - A "school district" is an area within a county in which one or more public schools must be maintained. Hobbs v. County of Moore, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 665</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 1 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        An "administrative unit" is not a "school district"
   
   within the meaning of this section. Hobbs v. County of Moore, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 665</cite>, 149 S.E.2d 1 (1966).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute which creates a public school district and allows a bond issue,
   
   upon the approval of voters, for its equipment and maintenance, is a local or special act, prohibited by this section. Robinson v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 590</cite>, 109 S.E. 855 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute which lays off or defines by boundary a certain territory as a graded school district within a county, and provides for an issue of bonds upon the approval of the voters therein, for the necessary buildings and maintenance, comes within the provision of this section. Board of Trustees v. Mutual Loan &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 306</cite>, 107 S.E. 130 (1921).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds and Taxes Authorized in Void Act.
   
   - Where an act to create a public school district is unconstitutional, because it violates this section, the provision for bonds and taxation to carry out the purpose of the act is likewise void. Sechrist v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 511</cite>, 107 S.E. 503 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        An act for the purpose of ratifying a county ordinance providing for the issuance of bonds and levy of taxes for school purposes in a district established without authority is a local, private or special act prohibited by this section, and the issuance of such bonds and levy of such taxes will be permanently enjoined. Woosley v. Commissioners of Davidson County, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 429</cite>, 109 S.E. 368 (1921).

        Allowing Existing School District to Submit Question of Bonds and Taxation to Voters.
   
   - A statute allowing an existing consolidated school district to submit the question of taxation and the issue of bonds for school purposes to the district is not prohibited by this section. Burney v. Commissioners of Bladen County, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 274</cite>, 114 S.E. 298 (1922).

        Incorporation of Existing School Districts.
   
   - Incorporating existing local school districts for all purposes relating to the issuance or payment of bonds upon the approval of the voters of a district is valid and is not in contravention of this section. Board of Trustees v. Mutual Loan &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 306</cite>, 107 S.E. 130 (1921); Paschal v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 129</cite>, 110 S.E. 841 (1922).

        Setting Up Machinery Under Which County May Establish School Districts.
   
   - This section prohibits the legislature from passing any special, private or local act which ex proprio vigore undertakes to establish or change the boundaries of a school district, but this section does not proscribe the legislature from setting up machinery under which a county, as the administrative unit charged with making provisions for necessary capital outlay, may create school districts or special bond tax units within the county to accomplish this purpose. Therefore, Public-Local Laws of 1937, c. 279, which provided the machinery under which the county of Buncombe could establish school districts or special bond tax units in the county, was not in contravention of this section. Fletcher v. Collins, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 1</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 606 (1940); Hinson v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 1</cite>3, 9 S.E.2d 614 (1940).

       </p>
       <p>
        Enabling Consolidation of County and City School Administrative Units Under General Laws.
   
   - A statute enabling the consolidation of county and city school administrative units under the general laws and the levy of certain taxes for the construction and operation of the schools of the consolidated unit does not violate this section, since it does not, in itself, undertake to establish or change the lines of a school district, but merely provides machinery for action by local units under the general law, and further provisions of the statute requiring that the merger and the levy of the taxes be approved by a vote does not alter this result. Peacock v. County of Scotland, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 199</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 612 (1964).

       <p>
        Extending Limits of City or Town in which Schools May Be Maintained.
   
   - While the boundaries of a "district" may be coterminous with those of a city or town, it does not follow that an act extending the limits of a city or town in which public schools may be maintained is necessarily a special act establishing or changing the lines of school districts in violation of the Constitution. Hailey v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 17</cite>, 144 S.E. 377 (1928).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognizing School District in Changed City Limits.
   
   - A public-local act that enlarged the city limits and recognized therein the independent existence of a public school district within the former limits was not contrary to the provisions of this section, as an attempt to establish a school district, or to change the limits of those already established. Duffy v. City of Greensboro, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 470</cite>, 120 S.E. 53 (1923).

        "Trade," within the meaning of this section, is a business venture for profit, and includes any employment or business embarked in for gain or profit. High Point Surplus Co. v.

       </p>
       <p>
        "Trade," as used in this section, refers to commerce engaged in by citizens of the State, and not a restricted activity conducted by the State itself. Gardner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 581</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 139 (1967); Smith v. County of Mecklenburg, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 497</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 67 (1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        When the legislature passed legislation enabling a particular county to adopt an ordinance prohibiting employment discrimination, it violated subdivision (1)(j) of this section because there was no rational basis to treat this county differently from any other county as to this subject, nor was there evidence that the employment practices in this county were different from those in any other county in the state, and the legislation enabled the county to regulate labor and trade.

   - Session Laws 1965, c. 650, authorizing a local option election in Reidsville to determine whether alcoholic beverage control stores may be operated in that city and providing for the establishment of a city board of alcoholic control if authority is granted, does not violate this section as the act of dispensing intoxicating liquor by the State is not a trade, but is a valid exercise of its police powers.

        An act which restricts or regulates the operation, engaging in or carrying on of business, or prohibits the sale of merchandise, on Sunday, regulates trade. High Point Surplus Co. v. Pleasants, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 650</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 697 (1965).

        Sunday-Observance Ordinances.
   
   - When a county or a city attempts to pass, under a local grant of police power, a Sunday-observance ordinance whose only effect is to regulate trade, the legislation must yield to this section, whether the purported authority to pass it is specifically conferred in the act or not. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        When enacted by cities and towns under general laws, Sunday-observance ordinances which are reasonable and do not discriminate within a class of competitors similarly situate have been upheld as a valid exercise of delegated police power. All such ordinances, when they proscribe buying and selling, whether it be, say, tangible merchandise or a ticket to an amusement or a sporting event, regulate trade under the broad definition of trade which has been adopted by the Supreme Court. Since, however, these city ordinances are passed under general laws, with reference to them there is no conflict between the exercise of the police power and this section. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        If an ordinance prohibits all of a certain type of activity on Sunday,
   
   as, e.g., motor vehicle racing, which might or might not be commercial, its exercise of police power does not conflict with this section, for its regulation of trade is merely incidental or consequential. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition of Motor Vehicle Races on Sunday.
   
   - Session Laws of 1949, c. 177, which bans all motor vehicle races on Sunday in Wake County without regard to the commercial or noncommercial character of the activity, is not an act regulating labor or trade within the meaning of this section. Persons whose activities are commercial in character are in no better position than those who engage in the proscribed activity without reference to profit. State v. Chestnutt, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 401</cite>, 85 S.E.2d 297 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute which purported to authorize only 52 of the 100 counties
   
   to regulate and prohibit the sale of goods, wares, and merchandise on Sunday, was a local act regulating trade and thus a violation of this section. State v. Smith, <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 173</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 293 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1963 amendment to G.S. 14-346.2,
   
   proscribing the sale on Sunday of merchandise of specific classifications within the State, but exempting designated counties and parts of counties therefrom, with provision that the areas exempted are exempted upon the classification of such areas as resort or tourist areas, but which does not define "resort area" and which as a matter of common knowledge does not exempt all recognized tourist areas of the State or, by its classifications of goods, preclude the sale only of such merchandise as is inappropriate to the tourist trade, is held void as a local law in violation of this section. Treasure City of Fayetteville, Inc. v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">261 N.C. 130</cite>, 134 S.E.2d 97 (1964).

        by allowing a board of education to utilize alternative contracting methods to those normally specified for local school boards did not violate the prohibition against local or special acts regulating trade; this was despite the fact that the statutes applied to only one board of education and were, therefore, local in nature, because the clear intent of the legislation was to regulate the bid process, rather than trade, and the law operated uniformly on all potential contractors or bidders for the covered construction projects.

       The constitutional independence of executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders. In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor, could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively derogative of the Governor's constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers.

       The constitutional independence of executive offices, and their differing functions and duties, create clear potential for conflict between their respective holders. In the event of such conflict, power in the Attorney General to resolve, without their consent, controversies involving agencies or departments under the supervision of the Governor, could be abused by exercise in a manner effectively derogative of the Governor's constitutional duties to exercise executive power and to supervise the official conduct of all executive officers. The General Assembly, in the enactment of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.114.html#t114a01s114-2" target="_blank">G.S. 114-2(2)</a></cite>, did not intend to create such potential.

   - When executive officers appointed by the General Assembly form a majority on a commission that has the final say on how to execute the laws the General Assembly, not the Governor, can exert most of the control over the executive policy that is implemented; the Governor cannot take care that the laws are faithfully executed, and the separation of powers clause does not allow the General Assembly to take this much control over the execution of the laws from the Governor and lodge it with itself.

       Appropriation of Federal Block Grant Funds.
   
   - Governor's claim challenging the General Assembly's appropriation of federal block grant funds awarded to the State was properly dismissed as the block grant funds were, despite their source in the federal government, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly because Congress left the issue of state legislative appropriation of federal block grants for each state to determine; and, while some federal funds could be considered custodial agency funds, the State Budget Act treated federal block grants as state funds subject to appropriation through the statutory budgetary process, and the Governor did not identify any federal prohibition against treating the block grant funds as state funds subject to legislative appropriation.

       Pardons Exclusive Prerogative of Governor.
   
   - After a defendant has begun the service of his term, or at least when that takes place after the adjournment of the court, it is beyond the jurisdiction of the judge to alter the sentence or interfere with it in any way, as the power of pardon, parole or discharge during the term of imprisonment is by this section the exclusive prerogative of the Governor.

       Power of General Assembly to Pass Amnesty Act.
   
   - The power, granted by this section, to exercise clemency after conviction in some particular case and in favor of an individual especially charged with an offense is an executive act of a quasi-judicial kind, and does not conflict with or exclude the power of the General Assembly to pass an amnesty act in abolition or oblivion of the offense.

       Conditional Pardon.
   
   - The Governor may grant a pardon upon a condition precedent that the prisoner pay costs of trial, and upon condition subsequent, that he remain of good character, and be sober and industrious. In re Williams, <cite class="nc_code">149 N.C. 436</cite>, 63 S.E. 108, 22 L.R.A. (n.s.) 238 (1908).

      <p>
       Pardon While Appeal Pending.
   
   - The term "conviction" in this section denotes a verdict of guilty rendered by a jury; therefore, when defendant, after verdict and judgment in the court below, appealed to the Supreme Court and, pending such appeal, was pardoned by the Governor, such pardon was authorized by this section and was valid. State v. Alexander, <cite class="nc_code">76 N.C. 231</cite> (1877); State v. Mathis, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 815</cite>, 13 S.E. 917 (1891).

       Commutation of Sentence.
   
   - The exercise by the Governor of his judgment, resulting in the commutation of the sentence of one man convicted of murder or rape and the refusal to commute the sentence of another convicted of such crime, cannot be called "freakish" or "arbitrary" merely because another governor might, theoretically, have reached opposite conclusions. State v. Jarrette, <cite class="nc_code">284 N.C. 625</cite>, 202 S.E.2d 721 (1974), death sentence vacated, 428 U.S. 903, 96 S. Ct. 3205, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1206 (1976).

       Sentence Active in Part and Suspended in Part.
   
   - It is not within the power of a court to impose a sentence active in part and suspended in part. Where a single offense is involved, the sentence must be made active in full or suspended in full. A split sentence is in effect an anticipatory pardon or parole, violative of the provisions of the Constitution of North Carolina appertaining to pardons and paroles.

       Power of Appointment.

      </p>
      <p>
       While the appointments clause itself places no restrictions on the General Assembly's ability to appoint statutory officers, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.130A.html#t130Aa09s130A-309.202ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 130A-309.202(b)</a></cite> (Repealed), 143B-291(a1), and 143B-293.2(a1) violate the separation of powers clause; the legislative branch has exerted too much control over commissions that have final executive authority, and by doing so, it has prevented the Governor from performing his express constitutional duty to take care that the laws are faithfully executed. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Governor's power to appoint officers under the clause thus continues to extend only to constitutional officers; as a result, the appointments clause authorizes the Governor to appoint all constitutional officers whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the constitution, and it follows that the appointments clause does not prohibit the General Assembly from appointing statutory officers to administrative commissions. State ex rel. McCrory v. Berger, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 633</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 248 (2016).

       Appointments clause does not prohibit the General Assembly from appointing statutory officers; the clause gives the Governor the exclusive authority to appoint constitutional officers whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the constitution and does not prohibit the General Assembly from appointing statutory officers to administrative commissions.

       Phrase "whose offices are established by this Constitution" still means "whose appointments are not otherwise provided for by the Constitution"; just as the phrase "whose appointments are not otherwise provided for" refers only to those appointments not otherwise provided for in the constitution itself, the phrase "all officers" might refer only to constitutional officers.

       Supreme Court of North Carolina concludes that the relevant provisions of 2017 N.C. Sess. Laws 2017-6, when considered as a unified whole, leave the Governor with little control over the views and priorities of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement by requiring that a sufficient number of its members to block the implementation of the Governor's policy preferences be selected from a list of nominees chosen by the leader of the political party other than the one to which the Governor belongs, limiting the extent to which individuals supportive of the Governor's policy preferences have the ability to supervise the activities of the Bipartisan State Board, and significantly constraining the Governor's ability to remove members of the Bipartisan State Board.

       Manner in which the membership of the Bipartisan State Board of Elections and Ethics Enforcement is structured and operates under 2017 N.C. Sess.

       Senatorial confirmation of the members of the Governor's Cabinet does not violate the separation of powers clause when the Governor retains the power to nominate them, has strong supervisory authority over them, and has the power to remove them at will. The Governor's power to nominate is significant, and the ultimate appointee will be a person that he alone has chosen, subject only to an up-or-down vote by the Senate. The Governor's supervisory and removal powers, moreover, ensure that the Governor retains ample post-appointment control over how his Cabinet members perform their duties. As a result, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143B.html#t143Ba01s143B-9ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 143B-9(a)</a></cite>'s senatorial confirmation requirement leaves the Governor with enough control to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, and therefore does not violate the Separation of Powers Clause.

       Power of Appointment Under Constitution of 1868.
   
   - Construing Art. III,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   10, Const. 1868, corresponding to subsection (8) of this section, which prior to 1875 authorized the Governor to appoint "all officers whose offices are established by this Constitution, which shall be created by law, and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for," and prohibited the General Assembly from appointing or electing such officers, along with cognate sections of the Constitution of 1868, in reference to vacancies, etc., prior to 1875, it was held in various decisions that the term, "unless otherwise provided for" meant unless otherwise provided for by the Constitution itself, and that, except in specified and restricted instances, the legislature had no power to appoint to office or to fill vacancies therein. State ex rel. Clark v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. 59</cite> (1872); People ex rel. Nichols v. McKee, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 429</cite> (1873); People ex rel. Welker v.

      <p>
       Article III,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   10, Const. 1868, as it then existed, and others of kindred nature, were altered by the Convention of 1875, which removed the express prohibition and the express grant of power to the Governor restricted to "all officers whose offices are established by this Constitution and whose offices are not otherwise provided for." And it became the accepted view that, in all offices created by statute, including the directorates of State institutions, the power of appointment, either original or to fill vacancies, was subject to legislative provision as expressed in a valid enactment. See State ex rel. Salisbury v. Croom, <cite class="nc_code">167 N.C. 223</cite>, 83 S.E. 354 (1914); Cunningham v.

      <p>
       Filling Vacancy and Appointing for Regular Term Distinguished.
   
   - The Governor never nominates to the Senate to fill vacancies. He does that alone, in all cases. But where officers have to be appointed to fill a regular term, then he nominates to the Senate, unless it be an officer who is elected by the people, and then he never nominates to the Senate, but fills the vacancy or term by his own appointment (unless there is an officer holding over), until the people can elect.

       Transfer of Duties of Office.
   
   - While the General Assembly has the power to abolish an office created by legislative authority, it cannot by mere transfer to others of the duties, connected with an institution, necessary and useful to the public, to be exercised by them, oust the incumbent from an office belonging to him under a contract with the State.

      <p>
       Use of Pardoned Crime to Enhance or Sentence Improper.
   
   - The reasoning that an increased punishment for a current offense due to a prior pardoned conviction is not punishment for the prior pardoned offense is a legal fiction that conflicts with logic and the administrative duties of the governor; thus, trial court infringed upon the prerogatives of the governor by finding that defendant's prior conviction constituted an aggravating factor. State v. Clifton, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C.

       Clemency Power May Not Be Delegated.
   
   - As the exercise of the clemency power was the "exclusive prerogative" of the governor and could not be delegated, under the Rule of Necessity, even if a death row inmate's Woodard claims were cognizable by a court, the governor remained fully able to consider and resolve the inmate's clemency request.

       Public Release of Clemency Records.
   
   - Subject matter jurisdiction existed over the question of whether the Governor was required to release certain records relating to applications for clemency pursuant to the North Carolina Public Records Law because resolving the relevant issues required the court to exercise its fundamental responsibility to determine the proper meaning of N.C. Const., Art. III,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5(6); the case did not raise a political question by requiring the court to intrude upon the Governor's clemency powers, but only required the court to identify where to draw the line between the Executive Branch and the Legislature with respect to clemency, given the separation of powers doctrine. News &amp; Observer Publ'g Co. v. Easley, <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C.

       Transfer of money by the Governor from the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund to the State's General Fund exceeded the Governor's constitutional authority
   
   under N.C. Const., Art. III,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5 because the Current Operations and Capital Improvements Appropriations Act of 2001 was not followed when the Governor transferred the money directly into the General Fund without awaiting legislative action; N.C. Const., Art. III,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5 is a grant of authority to the Governor, which is limited to escrowing or reducing budgeted expenditures and does not create a power to transfer and spend funds appropriated for one purpose to another purpose without statutory authority, and while the Governor may "escrow" the Trust Fund monies to prevent a deficit, he or she may not transfer appropriated Trust Fund monies without awaiting appropriate legislative authority from the General Assembly. Goldston v. State, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 618, 683 S.E.2d 237 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 802</cite>, 690 S.E.2d 536 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       Temporary halts in expenditures, escrowing of funds awaiting legislative action, furloughs and other similar actions are constitutional because these actions reduce "total expenditures," and diverting the North Carolina Highway Trust Fund to the State's General Fund and expending the money does not reduce the "total expenditure" of state government but merely transfers money contrary to the budget appropriation statute; a transfer of this nature does not avoid the deficit but merely continues the status quo, which the phrase "necessary economies" under N.C. Const., Art. III,
   <span class="s1">
    §

   5 is required to alter, and the transfer of these funds, designated by the budget statute for one purpose and transferred by the Governor to another does not fulfill the Executive's duty to administer the budget enacted by the Legislature, nor does it assure that the laws are faithfully executed. Goldston v. State, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. App.</cite> 618, 683 S.E.2d 237 (2009), review denied, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 802</cite>, 690 S.E.2d 536 (2010).

       - The North Carolina Constitution sets forth the duties of the Governor and of the General Assembly including the duty of the Governor to "prepare and recommend to the General Assembly a comprehensive budget of the anticipated revenue and proposed expenditures of the State for the ensuing fiscal period." For a discussion of the Governor's role and an analysis of the Review of Reserve Funds in the 2004-2005 Revised Certified Budget, see opinion of Attorney General to the Honorable Leslie Merritt, Auditor, 2005 N.C.A.G. 3 (09/12/05).

        Duty of Attorney General.
       </b>
       - The Attorney General of North Carolina is a constitutional officer, and he is required to take an oath which among other things binds him to "support, maintain and defend the Constitution of North Carolina not inconsistent with the Constitution of the United States . . . ." It is but a small step from the language of this oath to the proposition asserted by the Attorney General, that his duty includes the defense of statutes of this State against charges of unconstitutionality.

       Sole Discretion of Attorney General.
   
   - In passing <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.114.html#t114a3As114-11.6" target="_blank">G.S. 114-11.6</a></cite>, the General Assembly made it clear that even upon a proper request and authorization by a district attorney, the Special Prosecution Division is to participate in criminal prosecutions only if the Attorney General, in his sole discretion as an independent constitutional officer, approves. Thus trial court exceeded its authority when it ordered that "the Attorney General's Office shall immediately assume the prosecution of" a capital case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

       Commissioner of Insurance.
   
   - Although the office of Commissioner of Insurance is one created by this section, his power and authority emanate from the General Assembly and are limited by legislative prescription. The only power he has to fix rates is such power as the General Assembly has delegated to and vested in him. State ex rel. Comm'r of Ins. v. North Carolina Rate Bureau, <cite class="nc_code">61 N.C.

       Vacancies Filled by Appointment until Election.

       Superintendent of Public Instruction.
   
   - Superior court properly determined that 2016 N.C. Sess. Laws 126 did not unconstitutionally transfer the authority conferred upon the State Board of Education to the Superintendent of Public Instruction because the statutory changes were not inconsistent with the Superintendent's authority as the secretary and chief administrative officer of the Board and as an "elective officer" whose duties were prescribed by law, and the Board's authority to "supervise and administer" the public school system, while the newly enacted statutory language provided that the Superintendent would direct and control all matters relating to the direct supervision and administration of the school system.

       Process of Approval or Disapproval of Execution Protocol Not Subject to the Administrative Procedure Act.
   
   - Superior court did not err in dismissing inmates' request for judicial review of the final decision of respondent North Carolina Council of State, which approved the lethal injection protocol the Department of Correction (DOC) submitted, because the process by which the Council approved or disapproved the DOC's lethal injection protocol was not subject to the APA, and the inmates could not challenge it by going through the Office of Administrative Hearings through the APA; instead, any issue the inmates had with the protocol rested with the General Court of Justice or the federal courts. Conner v. N.C. Council of State, <cite class="nc_code">365 N.C. 242</cite>, 716 S.E.2d 836 (2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly intended that the Department of Correction (DOC) have primary responsibility for the lethal injection process because <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015.html#t15a19s15-188" target="_blank">G.S. 15-188</a></cite> does not give the North Carolina Council of State authority beyond merely approving or disapproving the submitted protocol; the General Assembly did not intend to negate the express exemption that it provided to the DOC in the North Carolina Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by including a requirement that the Council approve the lethal injection protocol, and thus, the process by which the Council approves or disapproves the DOC's lethal injection protocol is not subject to the APA.

The remaining members of the Council of State may make similar delegations or designations where, in the member's judgment, other duties necessitate his absence and the statute creating his ex officio membership does not express or clearly imply an intent of the General Assembly that the powers of such membership be exercised personally.

       </b>
      </h4>
      <p>
       Judicial Power Vested in General Court of Justice.
   
   - The primary purpose of the 1962 amendment, which rewrote Art. IV of the Constitution of 1868, was to establish "a unified judicial system." To accomplish this result, all judicial power, except that vested in a court for the trial of impeachments and in administrative agencies, is now vested by the Constitution in the General Court of Justice. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 35</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 791 (1967), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868, as rewritten in 1962.
      </p>
      <p>
       The judicial power of this state is "vested in a Court for the Trial of Impeachments and a General Court of Justice," and the latter constitutes "a unified judicial system for purposes of jurisdiction, operation, and administration," and includes a Superior Court Division. In re Alamance County Ct. Facilities, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 84</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 125 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitation on Power of General Assembly to Establish Courts.
   
   - The last clause of the former section, providing that the General Assembly shall have no power to "establish or authorize any courts other than as permitted by this article," was entirely new with the 1962 amendment to Art. IV of the Constitution of 1868. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 35</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 791 (1967), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868, as rewritten in 1962.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Assembly shall have no power to deprive the judicial department
   
   of any power or jurisdiction that rightfully pertains to it as a co-ordinate department of the government. In re Alamance County Ct. Facilities, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 84</cite>, 405 S.E.2d 125 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Reconciliation with Need for Administrative Expertise.
   
   - A major purpose of N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   3, is to reconcile the retention of judicial power in the judicial branch required by this section, with the recognized need to utilize administrative expertise in implementing complicated regulatory schemes such as the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitation on Power of Legislature to Alter Judicial Result.
   
   - The doctrine of separation of powers precludes the legislature from enacting a statute which alters a result obtained by a final judicial decision before the date of the statute's enactment. Hogan v. Cone Mills Corp., <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 127</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 477 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Constitution Shields Judicial Branch from Legislative Interference So Far as Its Inherent Rights and Powers.
   
   - Pursuant to N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   6 and N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1, the North Carolina Constitution shields the judicial branch from legislative interference, so far at least as its inherent rights and powers are concerned. Rhyne v. K-Mart Corp., <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 160</cite>, 594 S.E.2d 1 (2004).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The inherent power of the Supreme Court has not been limited by the Constitution;
   
   on the contrary, the Constitution protects such power. Beard v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 126</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 694 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The existence of inherent judicial power is not dependent upon legislative action;
   
   the General Assembly has recognized the existence of the inherent power of the court and cannot abridge that power. Beard v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 126</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 694 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When the jurisdiction of a particular court is constitutionally defined,
   
   the legislature cannot by statute restrict or enlarge that jurisdiction unless authorized to do so by the Constitution. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       The principle that when the jurisdiction of a particular court is constitutionally defined the legislature cannot by statute restrict or enlarge that jurisdiction unless authorized to do so by the Constitution is grounded on the separation of powers provisions found in many American Constitutions, including the Constitution of this State. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976); Hogan v. Cone Mills Corp., <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 127</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 477 (1985).
      </p>
      <p>
       A legislative declaration may not be given effect so as to alter or amend a final exercise of the courts' rightful jurisdiction. Gardner v. Gardner, <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 715</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 468 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Assembly has no authority to deprive the judicial department of any power or jurisdiction that rightfully pertains to it as a coordinate department of the government. Beard v. North Carolina State Bar, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 126</cite>, 357 S.E.2d 694 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The General Assembly is without authority to expand the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
   
   beyond the limits set in the Constitution. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court has no original jurisdiction over claims against the State,
   
   and the General Assembly has no authority to confer such jurisdiction upon it. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Appeal to Supreme Court from Administrative Decisions.
   
   - The General Assembly has no authority to provide for appeal from decisions of administrative agencies to the Supreme Court without prior appeal to and review by a lower court within the General Court of Justice. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly May Not Confer Judicial Power on Police Officer.
   
   - A police officer is neither an official of the General Court of Justice, nor an administrative agency within the meaning of Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   3, Const. 1868; hence the General Assembly lacks constitutional authority to confer judicial power upon a police officer. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 35</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 791 (1967), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868, as rewritten in 1962.
      </p>
      <p>
       Former G.S. 160-20.1 and Session Laws 1963, c. 1093, purporting to confer judicial powers on police "desk officers" who were not officers of the General Court of Justice and who were not vested with judicial power on November 6, 1962, were unconstitutional and void. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 35</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 791 (1967), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868, as rewritten in 1962.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Police Officer May Not Authorize Issuance of Warrant.
   
   - The General Assembly cannot confer upon a police officer judicial power sufficient to authorize the issuance of a valid warrant under any circumstances, even where the complainant is a private citizen and has no connection with any law-enforcement agency. State v. Matthews, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 35</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 791 (1967), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868, as rewritten in 1962.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial Review of Acts of General Assembly.
   
   - The courts of this State have no inherent power to review acts of the General Assembly and to declare invalid those which the courts disapprove, or, upon their own initiative, find to be in conflict with the Constitution. Green v. Eure, <cite class="nc_code">27 N.C. App.</cite> 605, 220 S.E.2d 102 (1975), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 297</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 696 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       While plaintiffs could not obtain judicial review under G.S. 150A-43 (now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.150B.html#t150Ba04s150B-43" target="_blank">G.S. 150B-43</a></cite>) of their claim that <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.143B.html#t143Ba08s143B-350ol1f8" target="_blank">G.S. 143B-350(f)(8)</a></cite>, conferring on the State Board of Transportation the power and duty to approve all highway construction programs, unconstitutionally delegates legislative power to the board, since the claim involves no agency "decision", such claim could be heard pursuant to this section. Orange County Sensible Hwys. &amp; Protected Env'ts, Inc. v. North Carolina Dep't of Transp., <cite class="nc_code">46 N.C. App.</cite> 350, 265 S.E.2d 890 (1980).
      </p>
      <p>
       Courts have authority to direct that "restricted" state funds be shared with a charter school because the provisions of G.S. 115C-238.29H(b) require that the amount of all monies placed in the "local current expense fund" for the local school administrative unit must be considered in calculating the per pupil amount due to a charter school; inclusion of these funds in the computation does not constitute a directive that "restricted funds" be "shared" with the charter school. Thomas Jefferson Classical Acad. v. Rutherford County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">215 N.C. App.</cite> 530, 715 S.E.2d 625 (2011), review denied, 2012 N.C.

      </p>
      <p>
       Trial court erred in declaring unconstitutional the Opportunity Scholarship Program because no prohibition in the constitution or in supreme court precedent foreclosed the General Assembly's enactment of the legislation; to the extent that taxpayers disagreed with the General Assembly's educational policy decision as expressed in the Opportunity Scholarship Program, their remedy was with the legislature, not the courts.

      <p>
       Judicial Functions in Criminal Cases.
   
   - The functions of the court in regard to the punishment of crimes are to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused, and, if that determination be one of guilt, then to pronounce the punishment or penalty prescribed by law. Jernigan v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 556</cite>, 184 S.E.2d 259 (1971).
      </p>
      <p>
       Statutory limitations barring a trial court from granting defendant pre-trial confinement credit for time spent in federal custody on a related charge did not unconstitutionally infringe on the power of the judiciary because the power to prescribe punishments for crimes belonged to the legislative branch.

        Standing.
       </b>
       - In the context of standing, N.C. Supreme Court's judicial power is limited by principles of self-restraint requiring a direct injury when attacking the validity of a statute under the constitution; when a person alleges the infringement of a legal right directly under a cause of action at common law, a statute, or the North Carolina Constitution, however, the legal injury itself gives rise to standing. The N.C. Constitution confers standing to sue in state courts on those who suffer the infringement of a legal right. Comm. to Elect Forest v. Employees Pac, - N.C.

       Grant of Discretionary Parole Power.
   
   - Former G.S. 148-62, insofar as it granted discretionary power to the Board of Paroles (now the Parole Commission), was not an assignment of judicial power to the Board in contravention of this section and N.C. Const., Art. I,

       - An act vesting in the Administrative Rules Review Commission (ARRC), a commission appointed by the General Assembly, the power to delay indefinitely the effective date of duly adopted agency rules which it deems in excess of statutory authority would likely be held to violate this section by vesting the ARRC with judicial powers reserved to the court and with supreme legislative powers reserved to the General Assembly.

       Purpose.
   
   - A major purpose of this section is to reconcile the retention of judicial power in the judicial branch required by N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1, with the recognized need to utilize administrative expertise in implementing complicated regulatory schemes such as the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The application of this section requires three questions be answered:
   
   (1) for what purposes was the agency created?; (2) which peculiarly "judicial" power has the General Assembly attempted to vest in the agency?; and (3) is the Legislature's grant of such judicial power reasonably necessary as an incident to the accomplishment of the purposes for which the agency was created? In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Considerations Irrelevant to Determination of Whether Judicial Power Properly Conferred.
   
   - Considerations such as the maximum size of the civil penalty and the availability of alternative enforcement sanctions are irrelevant to the question of whether a civil penalty is a peculiarly "judicial" power reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of an agency's purposes; since the judiciary does not possess the power to enact specific civil penalties or other alternative enforcement sanctions, these legislative choices are not at issue in determining whether the Legislature has usurped a judicial power which may not be conferred under this section. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitation on Power of Legislature to Alter Judicial Result.
   
   - The doctrine of separation of powers precludes the legislature from enacting a statute which alters a result obtained by final judicial decision before the date of the statute's enactment. Hogan v. Cone Mills Corp., <cite class="nc_code">315 N.C. 127</cite>, 337 S.E.2d 477 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Presumption of Propriety in Official Acts.
   
   - There is a rebuttable presumption that an administrative agency has properly performed its official duties; while arbitrary and capricious agency action is itself prohibited by federal and state due process, any assertion of arbitrary agency action does not necessarily require the agency's action be reviewed for compliance with every other requirement under the State and federal Constitutions. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">92 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 373 S.E.2d 572 (1988), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not prohibit the legislature from conferring the power on administrative agencies to assess civil penalties.
   
   In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Agencies Are Not Courts.
   
   - Administrative agencies referred to in this section ex vi termini are distinguished from courts. They are not constituent parts of the General Court of Justice. State ex rel. N.C. Utils.

      </p>
      <p>
       Even though superior court's order of consecutive sentencing was contrary to law, the Department of Corrections could not alter that order by refusing to change defendant's records to reflect concurrent sentencing without violating the separation of powers doctrine under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   6; the order was entered under the superior court's exclusive, original jurisdiction over all criminal actions under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va22s7A-271ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-271(a)</a></cite>, and was therefore a voidable, not a void, judgment, and the Department, as a part of the executive branch, was bound to honor the judgment until it was corrected or vacated.

       Attempted grant to the Commissioner of Insurance of judicial power
   
   to impose a penalty upon an insurance agent for a violation of the insurance laws, varying in the Commissioner's discretion from a nominal sum to $25,000, violated this section, there being no reasonable necessity for conferring such judicial power upon the Commissioner. State ex rel. Lanier v. Vines, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 486</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 161 (1968), decided under former Art. IV, Const. 1868, as amended in 1962.

      <p>
       Civil Penalty Power Was Necessary to Accomplish Agency's Purpose.
   
   - This section contemplates that discretionary judicial authority may be granted to an agency when reasonably necessary to accomplish the agency's purposes; civil penalty power was reasonably necessary to the purposes for which North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (NRCD) (now the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) was established. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section does not prohibit the legislature from conferring on administrative agencies the power to exercise discretion in determining civil penalties within an authorized range,
   
   provided that adequate guiding standards accompany that discretion. In re Appeal from Civil Penalty Assessed for Violations of Sedimentation Pollution Control Act, <cite class="nc_code">324 N.C. 373</cite>, 379 S.E.2d 30 (1989).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Assessment of Civil Penalties Must Be Reasonably Necessary.
   
   - Administrative agencies are not constitutionally barred from assessing civil penalties. All administrative civil penalties are not per se in violation of the State Constitution, rather, the granting of the judicial power to assess a civil penalty must be "reasonably necessary" to the purposes for which the agency was created and with appropriate guidelines for the exercise of the discretion. North Carolina Private Protective Servs. Bd. v. Gray, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 143, 360 S.E.2d 135 (1987).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Assessment of Penalty Held Constitutional.
   
   - The authority of the Private Protective Services Board under subsection (c) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.074C.html#t74Ca01s74C-17" target="_blank">G.S. 74C-17</a></cite> to assess a civil penalty of up to two thousand dollars ($2,000) in lieu of revocation or suspension of a license is not an unconstitutional attempt to confer a judicial power on a state agency; the provision authorizing civil penalties is reasonably necessary to the Board in fulfilling its duties to require that those who hold themselves out as providing private protective services to citizens must meet high standards of training and professionalism. North Carolina Private Protective Servs. Bd. v. Gray, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. App.</cite> 143, 360 S.E.2d 135 (1987).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section did not prohibit the legislature from conferring on the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development (NRCD) (now the Department of Environment and Natural Resources) the power to exercise discretion in determining civil penalties within an authorized range; plenary guiding standards existed to check the exercise of NRCD discretion in its assessment of civil penalties in varying amounts, commensurate with the seriousness of the violations of the Sedimentation Pollution Control Act.

       Intent of Amendment.
   
   - The language employed in the amendment to this section is a clear indication of the people's intent to empower the legislature to interrupt judicial terms of office with an age limit on active service. Martin v. State, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 412</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 474 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Interpretation of "For Service."
   
   - The words, "for service," as used in the amendment to this section refers exclusively to the time during which an individual justice or judge is eligible to serve notwithstanding the length of his or her term of office. The words, "for service," as used in this section therefore, evince an intent to empower the legislature to render particular justices or judges ineligible for active service because of age notwithstanding that time may remain in their terms of office. Martin v. State, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 412</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 474 (1991).

        Election of Judges Not Mandated by Federal Constitution.
       </b>
       - North Carolina could by Constitution provide for the appointment of all State judges without violating any provision of the federal Constitution. The election of superior court judges is not a necessary characteristic of a republican form of government and is not required by the Constitution of the United States. This is a political rather than a judicial question. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       Judicial elections have a component that implicates the fundamental right to vote and a separate component that is ordinarily the province of the legislature, subject only to review for rationality by the courts, and because the right to vote on equal terms for representatives triggers heightened scrutiny, even as the nonrepresentative aspects inherent in the role of the judiciary preclude strict scrutiny on a one-person, one-vote standard, neither rational basis nor strict scrutiny is an appropriate standard of review; the right to vote in superior court elections on substantially equal terms is a quasi-fundamental right which is subject to a heightened level of scrutiny, and the Equal Protection Clause, N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">

   19, requires intermediate scrutiny of districts drawn for the election of superior court judges. Blankenship v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 518</cite>, 681 S.E.2d 759 (2009).

        Validity of Superior Court Election, Rotation, and Residency Provisions.
       </b>
       - There can be no doubt as to the validity under the federal Constitution of the provisions of the North Carolina Constitution requiring the election of superior court judges by districts or statewide as prescribed by the legislature, or that the State be divided into divisions and districts and judges rotate among the districts, or that they reside in their respective districts. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A superior court judge is a hybrid official with both local and statewide functions and authority. The requirement that he reside in the district from which he is elected is a matter of convenience, making him available to hear emergency matters, and convenience is an essential factor in arranging an effective judicial system. He rotates among the districts of his division, and may be assigned beyond his division by the Chief Justice. Thus, there is a reasonable basis for election procedure requiring him to be nominated in the primary election and elected in the general election by statewide vote, and it serves and achieves a legitimate State purpose and is not arbitrary and capricious. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        The one man, one vote rule does not apply to the State judiciary,
       </b>
       and therefore a mere showing of a disparity among the voters or in the population figures of the district would not be sufficient to strike down the election procedure for superior court judges. A showing of an arbitrary and capricious or invidious action or distinction between citizens and voters would be required. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

       The issuance of a commission by the chief justice assigning a superior court judge
   
   to preside over a session of superior court does not endow the judge with jurisdiction, power, or authority to act as a superior court judge; the commission so issued merely manifests that such judge has been duly assigned pursuant to the Constitution to preside over such session of court. The judge's jurisdiction, power, and authority as a superior court judge flow from the Constitution of North Carolina and his appointment and commission by the Governor as a superior court judge.

        Meaning of Subsection (1).
   
   - Subsection (1) of this section, retaining the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over "issues of fact" and "questions of fact" as it had existed prior to the 1971 revision, has no relation to the court's prior original jurisdiction over claims against the State. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (6) of this section refers to a system of appeals from a lower court to a higher court
   
   within the General Court of Justice. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Old Fort Finishing Plant, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 416</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 8 (1965).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When the jurisdiction of a particular court is constitutionally defined,
   
   the legislature cannot by statute restrict or enlarge that jurisdiction unless authorized to do so by the Constitution. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The principle that when the jurisdiction of a particular court is constitutionally defined the legislature cannot by statute restrict or enlarge that jurisdiction unless authorized to do so by the Constitution is grounded on the separation of powers provisions found in many American Constitutions, including the Constitution of this State. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The superior court has original general jurisdiction
   
   throughout the State except as otherwise provided by the General Assembly. State v. Wall, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 675</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 363 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction of District Courts.
   
   - The General Assembly is authorized by general law to prescribe the jurisdiction and powers of district courts. State v. Wall, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 675</cite>, 157 S.E.2d 363 (1967).
       </p>

State v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">158 N.C. App.</cite> 654, 582 S.E.2d 331 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a petition to terminate parental rights was captioned with the names of both children, but the summons that was issued referenced only the younger child, the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to terminate the mother's parental rights in the older child because a summons pertaining to the child was not issued. In re C.T., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. App.</cite> 472, 643 S.E.2d 23 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction of Court of Appeals.
   
   - In a case in which defendant's <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa13s15A-269" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-269</a></cite> motion for post-conviction DNA testing was granted, a hearing was held pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa13s15A-270" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-270</a></cite>, and defendant appealed the trial court's denial of relief, the appellate court lacked jurisdiction. While <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsIIa13s15A-270" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-270</a></cite>.1 provided defendant with the right to appeal the denial of his motion for post-conviction DNA testing, the North Carolina General Assembly had not provided him with the right to appeal a denial of relief, and the North Carolina Constitution mandated that the North Carolina General Assembly prescribe by general law the scope of the jurisdiction of the North Carolina Court of Appeals. State v. Norman, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. App.</cite> 329, 688 S.E.2d 512 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was granted relief, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1415" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1415</a></cite>, from 50-year sentences, an appellate court could grant the State's certiorari petition, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-32(c)</a></cite>, because, under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa89s15A-1422ol1c3" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1422(c)(3)</a></cite>, the appeal time had expired and no appeal was pending, and granting the petition was necessary to "supervise and control" the trial court. State v. Wilkerson, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. App.</cite> 482, 753 S.E.2d 829 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal of the motion for appropriate relief would have fallen under the statute section by writ of certiorari; given that the state constitution authorizes the General Assembly to define the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals to supervise and control trial court proceedings, and there is no limiting language regarding which party may appeal a ruling on a motion for appropriate relief, the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction to hear an appeal by the State of a motion for appropriate relief when the defendant won relief, and while the appellate rule might appear to limit the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, the rules cannot take away jurisdiction given by the General Assembly. State v. Stubbs, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 40</cite>, 770 S.E.2d 74 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the State constitution gives the General Assembly the power to define the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, only the General Assembly can take away the jurisdiction that it has conferred; subsection (c) of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-32" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-32</a></cite> thus creates a default rule that the court of appeals has jurisdiction to review a lower court judgment by writ of certiorari, and the default rule will control unless a more specific statute restricts jurisdiction in the particular class of cases at issue. State v. Thomsen, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 22</cite>, 789 S.E.2d 639 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of Appeals of North Carolina had jurisdiction to consider a claimant's constitutional challenge to an act of the North Carolina General Assembly on appeal from a final decision and order of the North Carolina Industrial Commission because the claimant's constitutional challenge was not required to be heard by a three-judge panel of the Superior Court of Wake County, North Carolina. In re Redmond, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 490</cite>, 797 S.E.2d 275 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate court could grant defendant review by a writ of certiorari after pleading guilty because, while defendant's appeal raised no issue for which an appeal of right was afforded, (1) N.C. Const. art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   12(2) let the General Assembly prescribe the court's jurisdiction, (2) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-32ol1c" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-32(c)</a></cite> gave the court broad powers to control trial court proceedings, (3) <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIVa91s15A-1444ol1e" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1444(e)</a></cite> had no limiting language, and (4) N.C. R. App. P. 21 could not limit defendant's statutory right to seek the writ. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. App.</cite> 789, 802 S.E.2d 518 (2017).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The court of appeals has no jurisdiction to entertain a motion for summary judgment
   
   made for the first time on appeal. Britt v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">12 N.C. App.</cite> 399, 183 S.E.2d 303 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction over Civil and Criminal Appeals from District Court.
   
   - The constitutional and statutory structure of our General Court of Justice provides that, generally, appeals from the district court in civil causes go to the Court of Appeals, while appeals from the district court in criminal causes must go first to the superior court. State v. Killian, <cite class="nc_code">25 N.C. App.</cite> 224, 212 S.E.2d 419 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of Judicial Disciplinary Proceedings.
   
   - Under this section and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIa05s7A-32" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-32</a></cite> the courts of the appellate division have power to review judicial disciplinary proceedings, whether the attorney or the State has prevailed in the trial court. In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State may seek review by the appellate division of proceedings disciplining attorneys under the judicial method. However, the State may not appeal in such cases as a matter of right, but must seek appellate review by petition for writ of certiorari. In re Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 638</cite>, 252 S.E.2d 784 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of Attorney Disciplinary Proceedings.
   
   - The Court of Appeals of North Carolina lacked jurisdiction to hear the State Bar of North Carolina's appeal of a grant of summary judgment to an attorney in a disciplinary proceeding because <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.084.html#t84a04s84-28ol1h" target="_blank">G.S. 84-28(h)</a></cite> provided no appeal from a final order that did not impose discipline, and in the instant case, no discipline had been imposed. N.C. State Bar v. Rudisill, <cite class="nc_code">159 N.C. App.</cite> 704, 583 S.E.2d 413 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction over Eastern Band of Cherokee in Civil Matters.
   
   - North Carolina has had civil jurisdiction over the Eastern Band of the Cherokee at least since the emigration west following the Treaty of New Echota, when the Indians remaining in North Carolina became subject to the laws of the State. The fact that these Indians have since been recognized as an Indian tribe and brought under federal supervision did not remove the existing jurisdiction of the State of North Carolina. Sasser v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 253 S.E.2d 577, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 300</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 915 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts of this State have jurisdiction over a member of the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in a tort claim by a non-Indian arising from an occurrence on land within the Qualla Boundary. Sasser v. Beck, <cite class="nc_code">40 N.C. App.</cite> 668, 253 S.E.2d 577, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">298 N.C. 300</cite>, 259 S.E.2d 915 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The subject matter jurisdiction of the clerks of the superior court
   
   can only be conferred by statute. In re Locklear, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 412</cite>, 334 S.E.2d 46 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction Over a District Court's Revocation of Probation
   
   - When a district court revokes a defendant's probation, that defendant's appeal is to the superior court rather than the Court of Appeals of North Carolina; thus, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.015A.html#t15AsXIIIa82s15A-1347" target="_blank">G.S. 15A-1347</a></cite>, rather than <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7As0Va22s7A-272ol1d" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-272(d)</a></cite>, governed defendant's appeal of a probation revocation and the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. State v. Hooper, <cite class="nc_code">358 N.C. 122</cite>, 591 S.E.2d 514 (2004).
   <br />

        The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is conferred and defined by the Constitution,
   
   not by the General Assembly. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Old Fort Finishing Plant, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 416</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 8 (1965); Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate Jurisdiction Relates Solely to Appeals from Lower Courts.
   
   - The appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court relates solely to appeals from decisions of "the courts below." State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Old Fort Finishing Plant, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 416</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 8 (1965); Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court is an appellate court. Its function, under the Constitution, is to review alleged errors and rulings of the trial court, and unless and until it is shown that a trial court ruled on a particular question, it is not given for the Supreme Court to make specific rulings thereon. Greene v. Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 435</cite>, 73 S.E.2d 488 (1952).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Does Not Include Direct Appeals from Agencies.
   
   - The Utilities Commission, being an administrative agency and not a part of the General Court of Justice, direct appeals from the Utilities Commission to the Supreme Court are not constitutionally permissible. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. VEPCO, <cite class="nc_code">21 N.C. App.</cite> 45, 203 S.E.2d 418, rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">285 N.C. 398</cite>, 206 S.E.2d 283 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is to review, on appeal, decisions "of the courts below." This does not include jurisdiction to review on direct appeal the decisions of administrative agencies. State ex rel. N.C. Utils. Comm'n v. Old Fort Finishing Plant, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 416</cite>, 142 S.E.2d 8 (1965); Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The General Assembly has no authority to provide for appeal from decisions of administrative agencies to the Supreme Court without prior appeal to and review by a lower court within the General Court of Justice. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court is strictly an appellate court,
   
   its jurisdiction limited "to review upon appeal any decision of the court below upon any matter of law or legal inference." Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        General Assembly May Not Expand Its Appellate Jurisdiction.
   
   - The General Assembly is without authority to expand the appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court beyond the limits set in the Constitution. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 303</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 412 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court has supervisory jurisdiction over the lower courts,
   
   and will exercise this jurisdiction in order that the case may be tried on the correct theory below and unnecessary delay in the administration of justice be thereby prevented. Greene v. Charlotte Chem. Labs., Inc., <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 680</cite>, 120 S.E.2d 82 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court has general supervisory authority over the orders, judgments, and decrees of the superior courts of the State; this is a prerogative which, in a proper case, when necessary to promote the expeditious administration of justice, the Supreme Court will not hesitate to exercise. Park Terrace, Inc. v. Phoenix Indem. Co., <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 595</cite>, 91 S.E.2d 584 (1956); Brice v. Robertson House Moving, Wrecking &amp; Salvage Co., <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 74</cite>, 105 S.E.2d 439 (1958); In re Brownlee, <cite class="nc_code">301 N.C. 532</cite>, 272 S.E.2d 861 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court will not hesitate to exercise its rarely used general supervisory authority when necessary to promote the expeditious administration of justice. State v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 19</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 589 (1975).

   12 granted the court authority to exercise appellate review of any decision of the courts below. James v. Bartlett, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 260</cite>, 607 S.E.2d 638 (2005).
       </p>

   12(1) to exercise jurisdiction to review upon appeal any decision of the courts below, and as such, the Supreme Court of North Carolina did not hesitate to exercise its rarely used general supervisory authority when necessary to promote the expeditious administration of justice, and did so to consider questions that were not properly presented according to its rules; this exercise of supervisory authority was particularly appropriate when prompt and definitive resolution of an issue was necessary to ensure the uniform administration of North Carolina's criminal statutes. State v. Ellis, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 200</cite>, 639 S.E.2d 425 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>

   12(1), in a case in which a department of social services was ordered to pursue termination of a father's parental rights to address the father's challenge to the trial court's jurisdiction, despite the lack of a final order, because (1) the Court was cognizant that a court, which lacked subject matter jurisdiction over a dispute was absolutely without power to render a decision upon it; and (2) there could be questions in the trial courts and intermediate appellate court as to which provisions of Article 4 of the Juvenile Code were jurisdictional in nature.

        Issuance of Remedial Writs to Control Proceedings of Inferior Courts.
   
   - The Supreme Court is vested with authority to issue any remedial writ necessary to give it general supervision and control over the proceedings of inferior courts. State v. Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 523</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 663 (1949).

        What Matters Are Reviewable in Supreme Court.
   
   - Under the provisions of this section, the Supreme Court, on appeal from an issue of devisavit vel non, involved in the trial of a caveat to a will, is confined to a consideration of assignments of error in matters of law and legal inference. In re Will of Brown, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 583</cite>, 140 S.E. 192 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court on appeal in a criminal action can review only matters of law or legal inference. State v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 187</cite>, 162 S.E. 363 (1932). See also, State v. Anderson, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 771</cite>, 182 S.E. 643 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section empowers the Supreme Court to review on appeal any decision of the courts below, upon any matter of law or legal inference; and this is to be presented in accordance with the mandatory rules of the Supreme Court. State v. Bittings, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 798</cite>, 175 S.E. 299 (1934). See also, State v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 202</cite>, 189 S.E. 510 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal to the Supreme Court, only error as to the law or legal inferences are reviewable upon the record in the case. Merchants Nat'l Bank v. Howard, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 543</cite>, 125 S.E. 126 (1924); State v. Neill, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 252</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 155 (1956). See also, McKay v. Bullard, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 589</cite>, 14 S.E.2d 657 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court has authority to review the record on appeal and to grant a new trial or give other appropriate relief for an error of law committed by the trial court. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence and Credibility.
   
   - The competency, admissibility and sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal action is for the court, while the weight, effect and credibility is for the jury, and on appeal the Supreme Court can review only matters of law or legal inference. State v. Casey, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 185</cite>, 159 S.E. 337 (1931); Debnam v. Rouse, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 459</cite>, 160 S.E. 471 (1931); Carter v. Mullinax, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 783</cite>, 161 S.E. 486 (1931); Woody Bros. Bakery v. Greensboro Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 816</cite>, 161 S.E. 554 (1931); State v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">203 N.C. 210</cite>, 165 S.E. 551 (1932); State v. Whiteside, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 710</cite>, 169 S.E. 711 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court must accept as conclusive the verdict of the jury, so far as the credibility of witnesses is concerned. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court has no authority to grant a new trial or other relief to a defendant convicted of a criminal offense in a trial free from an error of law on grounds that it disagrees with the jury concerning the credibility of a witness for the State. State v. Lampkins, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 497</cite>, 212 S.E.2d 106 (1975), cert. denied, 428 U.S. 909, 96 S. Ct. 3220, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1216 (1976).

       <p>
        <b>
         Advisory Opinions.
        </b>
        -
   The North Carolina Constitution does not authorize the Supreme Court as a Court to issue advisory opinions; and while advisory opinions of individual justices may be persuasive authority for the points of law addressed, they are in no sense binding or obligatory on those points. In re Advisory Opinion, 314 N .C. 679, 335 S.E.2d 890 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Carolina Supreme Court declined to issue an advisory opinion as contemplated by Session Laws 1985, c. 746, on the grounds that to issue such an opinion would be to place the Court directly into the stream of the legislative process. In re Advisory Opinion, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 679</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 890 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Carolina Supreme Court is not a fact-finding body.
   
   State v. Lawson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 632</cite>, 314 S.E.2d 493 (1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1120, 105 S. Ct. 2368, 86 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Issues of Fact May Be Reviewed.
   
   - Prohibition of trial of "issues of fact" by the Supreme Court extends to issues of fact as heretofore understood, and does not hinder the Court from trying such questions of fact as may be involved in a consideration of the propriety of continuing or vacating an order for a provisional injunction. Heilig v. Stokes, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 612</cite> (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over issues of fact, under this section, will be assumed upon two conditions: (1) If the matter is of such an equitable nature as a court of equity under the former system took exclusive cognizance of; (2) If the proofs are written and documentary and in all respects the same as they were when the judge of the court below passed upon them. Worthy v. Shields, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 192</cite> (1884). See also, Keener v. Finger, <cite class="nc_code">70 N.C. 35</cite> (1874).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        For case defining "issues of fact," see
   
   Battle v. Mayo, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 413</cite>, 9 S.E. 384 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court cannot consider a paper which, unrelated to the trial, purports upon its face to have raised an issue of fact after the adjournment as to the recitals set forth in the commission given the presiding judge. State v. Graham, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 459</cite>, 140 S.E. 26 (1927).

Rather, "a finding," as used in that section means a "determination" or a "conclusion." State v. Lawson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 632</cite>, 314 S.E.2d 493 (1984).

The statute neither contemplates nor requires the court to make factual findings. State v. Lawson, <cite class="nc_code">310 N.C. 632</cite>, 314 S.E.2d 493 (1984).

   - The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, could determine the sufficiency of an amended complaint, including matters stricken therefrom in the lower court, as though a demurrer ore tenus to the amended complaint in its entirety had been lodged in the Supreme Court, and its ruling that a pleading, thus considered, was insufficient to state a cause of action necessarily included an affirmance of the order of the lower court sustaining the demurrer ore tenus to the amended complaint exclusive of the portions previously stricken out. Philbrook v. Chapel Hill Hous. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">269 N.C. 598</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 153 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination of Matter Where Appeal Is Premature.
   
   - Where an order of the superior court is interlocutory, and an appeal therefrom to the Supreme Court is premature and is subject to dismissal, the Supreme Court in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction may nevertheless, in proper instances, determine the matter in order to obviate a wholly unnecessary and circuitous course of procedure. Edwards v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 137</cite>, 81 S.E.2d 273 (1954); Kelly v. Piper, <cite class="nc_code">243 N.C. 54</cite>, 89 S.E.2d 764 (1955).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration of Questions Not Properly Presented.
   
   - The Supreme Court, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, may decide questions on the merits, even though the procedure prescribed by the rules of practice as necessary to present such questions has not been followed. Eastern Steel Prods. Corp. v. Chestnutt, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 269</cite>, 113 S.E.2d 587 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the lower court holds the statute attacked by defendant to be unconstitutional, the Supreme Court, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction over the inferior courts, may consider the constitutional questions, notwithstanding that defendant failed properly to present them in the lower court, but even so the Supreme Court will ordinarily consider only the specific constitutional questions discussed in the brief. Rice v. Rigsby, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 506</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 469 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the exercise of the constitutional power vested in the Supreme Court to issue any remedial writs necessary to give it a general supervision and control over the proceedings of the inferior courts, the Court would overlook defendant's failure to designate the specific constitutional provisions that he contended 1955 Session Laws, c. 358, violated, and consider the question, even though the procedure prescribed by the rules of practice as necessary to present such question was not followed. Rice v. Rigsby, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 506</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 469 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, the Supreme Court will not consider questions not properly presented by objections duly made, exceptions duly entered, and assignments of error properly set out, though it may do so in exceptional circumstances in the exercise of its supervisory and controlling jurisdiction over the proceedings of the other courts vested in it by this section. State v. Hewett, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 348</cite>, 154 S.E.2d 476 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under unusual and exceptional circumstances the court will exercise power under this section to consider questions which are not properly presented according to the rules. State v. Stanley, <cite class="nc_code">288 N.C. 19</cite>, 215 S.E.2d 589 (1975).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Correction of Error in Judgment In Rem Where Appeal Is Subject to Dismissal.
   
   - Even though an appeal may be subject to dismissal, if the proceeding is in rem and the judgment entered in the court below vitally affects the title to real property, the Supreme Court will take jurisdiction for the purpose of correcting an error in the judgment. This can be done in the exercise of its supervisory power. Ange v. Ange, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 506</cite>, 71 S.E.2d 19 (1952); Edwards v. Butler, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 205</cite>, 92 S.E.2d 922 (1956).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of Habeas Corpus Proceedings.
   
   - No appeal to the Supreme Court lies upon the refusal of the judge, having jurisdiction, to release the petitioner in habeas corpus proceedings, except in cases concerning the care and custody of children, the remedy being by application for the writ of certiorari which lies in the discretion of the appellate court. State v. Yates, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 753</cite>, 111 S.E. 337 (1922); State v. Hooker, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 763</cite>, 111 S.E. 351 (1922); In re Blake, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 278</cite>, 114 S.E. 294 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        A decree in habeas corpus proceedings to determine the custody of a child as between its divorced parents is not appealable, the sole remedy being by certiorari to invoke the constitutional power of the Supreme Court to supervise and control proceedings of inferior courts. In re Ogden, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 100</cite>, 189 S.E. 119 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although petitioner's purported appeal from a judgment rendered on return to a writ of habeas corpus would ordinarily have been dismissed, it would be treated as a petition for writ of certiorari by the Supreme Court in order that an important question presented by the record might be clarified. In re Renfrow, <cite class="nc_code">247 N.C. 55</cite>, 100 S.E.2d 315 (1957).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Certiorari.
   
   - Where an application for writ of certiorari in the nature of a writ of error is made for the purpose of bringing up an appeal when the right of appeal is lost in the trial court by failure to file statement of case on appeal within the time allowed, applicant must negative laches and show merit. State v. Moore, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 686</cite>, 188 S.E. 421 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court has the power to issue any remedial writ necessary to give it general supervision and control over proceedings of the lower courts, and to this end would grant certiorari to review an order of the superior court ordering the State to pay attorney's fees for representation of an indigent defendant in the federal courts, which involved a question of public importance. State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 1</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 749, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 828, 88 S. Ct. 87, 19 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1967).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of Error Coram Nobis.
   
   - There is no justification for a rule that would require a person who is not in prison to obtain permission from an appellate court in order to file a petition for a writ of error coram nobis to attack collaterally a final judgment of a trial court from which no appeal was taken. Dantzic v. State, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 212</cite>, 182 S.E.2d 563 (1971), overruling In re Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 566</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 857 (1949); State v. Daniels, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 509</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 653, cert. denied, 339 U.S. 954, 70 S. Ct. 837, 94 L. Ed. 1366 (1950), and State v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Remand for Further Consideration.
   
   - Where an order of the superior court made no ruling on exceptions to an order of the Public Utilities Commission, but remanded the cause to the Commission for a determination, after further proceedings, of the precise question it had theretofore considered and decided, without specifying the ground on which the court's order was based, the Supreme Court, under the circumstances, in the exercise of its power under this section to issue any remedial writs necessary to give it a general supervision and control over the proceedings of the inferior courts, would vacate the court's order and remand the cause to the superior court for consideration and decision of the questions raised by protestants' exceptions to the Commission's findings and order. State ex rel. Utils. Comm'n v. Maybelle Transp. Co., <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 776</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 768 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Case in which the State had no right of appeal
   
   would be dismissed where the case was not one in which the alleged error appeared on the face of the record proper, which might have been corrected in the Supreme Court's supervisory power under this section, but was to review a ruling of the court entered on motion after trial, as well as an application for certiorari. State v. Todd, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 776</cite>, 32 S.E.2d 313 (1944).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Adherence to Theory of Trial in Lower Court.
   
   - The principle that an appeal will be determined in accordance with the theory of trial in the lower court is enforced by the Supreme Court because of its limited jurisdiction as an appellate court under this section. Apostle v. Acacia Mut. Life Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 95</cite>, 179 S.E. 444 (1935). See also Ammons v. Fisher, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 712</cite>, 182 S.E. 479 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Enforcement of Opinion and Mandate.
   
   - When it comes to the attention of the Supreme Court that a lower court has failed to comply with the opinion of the Supreme Court, whether through insubordination, misinterpretation or inattention, the Supreme Court will, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, ex mero motu if necessary, enforce its opinion and mandate in accordance with the requirements of justice. Collins v. Simms, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 1</cite>, 125 S.E.2d 298 (1962).

    25 and this section must be read in conjunction with one another.
   
   This section merely establishes the form and procedure for the trial of all civil actions, including the procedure of having issues of fact decided by a jury in what were formerly equity proceedings; to determine whether there exists a constitutional right to trial by jury of a particular cause of action, one looks to N.C. Const., Art. I,

   25, which ensures that there is a right to trial by jury where the underlying cause of action existed at the time of adoption of the 1868 Constitution, regardless of whether the action was formerly a proceeding in equity.

         II. CIVIL ACTIONS.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity,
   
   leaving such rights and remedies to be enforced in the one court, which theretofore had administered simply legal rights. Peebles v. Gay, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 38</cite>, 20 S.E. 173 (1894). See Reynolds v. Reynolds, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 578</cite>, 182 S.E. 341 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Distinction Between Principles Is Not Abolished.
   
   - Equity is now administered in the same courts as matters of law, but the distinction between equitable and legal principles has not been abolished. Waters v. Garris, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 305</cite>, 124 S.E. 334 (1924); Furst &amp; Thomas v. Merritt, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 397</cite>, 130 S.E. 40 (1925); Page Trust Co. v. Godwin, <cite class="nc_code">190 N.C. 512</cite>, 130 S.E. 323 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, abolishing the distinctions between actions at law and suits in equity, does not imply that the distinctions as between law and equity are abolished. Principles of law and principles and doctrines of equity, remain the same as they have ever been; the change wrought is in the method of administering them and, in some degree, the extent of the application of them. The abolition does not destroy equitable rights and remedies, nor does it merge legal and equitable rights. Scales v. Wachovia Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 772</cite>, 143 S.E. 868 (1928).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inapplicability of Equitable Principle to Contract Action.
   
   - This section, providing that legal and equitable remedies be administered in the same court, does not abolish the recognized distinction in the principles applicable to each; and as an action to enforce the provisions of a contract is one at law, the equity that time is not the essence of the contract has no application. Makuen v. Elder, <cite class="nc_code">170 N.C. 510</cite>, 87 S.E. 334 (1915).
   <br />

        Superior Courts as Successors of Courts of Equity.
   
   - Under this section and former Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   20, Const. 1868, the superior courts became the successors of the courts of equity, having their jurisdiction and exercising their equitable powers unless restrained by statute. In re Estate of Smith, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 272</cite>, 156 S.E. 494 (1931).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        One Action to Determine Legal and Equitable Rights and Remedies.
   
   - Legal and equitable rights and remedies are now determined in one and the same action. Woodall v. North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 428</cite>, 160 S.E. 475 (1931).
       </p>

        Animal welfare agency had standing to assert that an injunction and temporary custody order should be entered against the animal owners for the animal owners' alleged neglect and abuse of their animals despite the claim that the animal welfare agency had not suffered a legal injury itself; the North Carolina Constitution abolished the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity, leaving only one court to enforce such rights, and the legislature expressed the intent that the broadest category of persons or organizations be deemed a "real party in interest" when contesting cruelty to animals.appeal dismissed, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 690</cite>, 652 S.E.2d 254 (2007) Animal Legal Def. Fund v. Woodley, <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. App.</cite> 594, 640 S.E.2d 777 (2007).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Equitable Rights Only Enforceable by Civil Action.
   
   - Since the passage of this section the enforcement of an equitable right, as that of subrogation, can only be maintained by a civil action. Calvert v. Peebles, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 334</cite> (1880).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Rights of Prior Lienor Not Affected.
   
   - This section does not affect the rights of a prior lienor by a registered chattel mortgage in favor of a judgment creditor who has sold the personal property by execution under a judgment subsequent to the mortgage lien, or give the creditor a right to levy his execution instead of pursuing the equitable remedy. Rowland Hdwe. &amp; Supply Co. v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">173 N.C. 290</cite>, 92 S.E. 13 (1917).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of Defendant to Know Nature of Demand.
   
   - The necessity for drawing pleadings in civil actions according to a prescribed or established precedent ceased when the form of suits was abolished by this section. But one who is brought into court to answer a demand for damages or for specific property has the same fundamental right to know the nature of the demand sufficiently well to enable him, with the aid of competent counsel, to prepare his defense as he has to be informed of an accusation for which he might have to answer criminally. Conley v. Richmond &amp; D.R.R., <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 692</cite>, 14 S.E. 303 (1891).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Asking for Ancillary Remedy to Which Party Is Not Entitled.
   
   - There being but one form of action in civil cases, the fact that a plaintiff asks for one of the many remedies ancillary thereto, to which he is not entitled, does not affect the action itself, which will go on if he is entitled to any other of the remedies. Hargrove v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 418</cite>, 21 S.E. 916 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment of Pleadings by Direction of Court.
   
   - Where a good cause of action is stated for equitable relief, but is defective in form, the court may require the pleadings to be made definite and certain by amendment, the distinction between suits in equity and actions at law as to jurisdictional matters being abolished by this section. Green v. Harshaw, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 213</cite>, 121 S.E. 456 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Enforcement of Contracts.
   
   - The remedy for the enforcement of all kinds of contracts is now a civil action. Boles v. Caudle, <cite class="nc_code">133 N.C. 528</cite>, 45 S.E. 835 (1903).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Action for Money Had and Received.
   
   - Under this section, an exception to a complaint that by its form it is for money had and received, and that the action cannot be maintained unless the money has been actually received, is untenable. Staton v. Webb, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C. 35</cite>, 49 S.E. 55 (1904).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Action for Claim and Delivery.
   
   - There is no such thing as an action for claim and delivery. Under this section there is but one form of action in civil cases. Hargrove v. Harris, <cite class="nc_code">116 N.C. 418</cite>, 21 S.E. 916 (1895).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandamus.
   
   - There is now in this State but one form of action, and the writ of mandamus is but a process of the court in that action. August Belmont &amp; Co. v. Reilly, <cite class="nc_code">71 N.C. 260</cite> (1874).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Jury Trial in Equitable Distribution Action.
   
   - No right to bring an action for equitable distribution of marital property existed prior to the adoption of the equitable distribution statutes, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-21" target="_blank">G.S. 50-21</a></cite>, and the language of the statutes themselves create no new right to trial by jury; therefore, there is no right to trial by jury for such an action under the Constitution of North Carolina. Kiser v. Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 502</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 487 (1989).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Jury Trial in Action Seeking Attorneys' Fees Under Quantum Meruit.
   
   - Trial court did not err in denying a law firm's request for a jury trial on the reasonable value of the attorneys who had provided legal services for a client under a contingency fee agreement and who were then discharged by the client under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 and N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   13; until adoption of the modern rule, clients had no right to unilaterally discharge an attorney and force him to pursue a quantum meruit claim, and the right to a jury trial under N.C. Const., Art. I,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   25 was guaranteed only in cases in which the right and the remedy were in existence when the North Carolina Constitution of 1868 was adopted. Guess v. Parrott, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. App.</cite> 325, 585 S.E.2d 464 (2003).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Right to Jury in Foreclosure Proceeding.
   
   - Denial of a co-owner's motion for a jury trial in his appeal from a clerk's order allowing a foreclosure was proper because, inter alia, N.C. Const., Art. IV,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   13 did not create a constitutional right to trial by jury in all civil cases arising from controversies affecting private rights and redressing private wrongs. In re Foreclosure of Elkins, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. App.</cite> 226, 667 S.E.2d 259 (2008).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Stockholders' Derivative Actions.
   
   - Although stockholders' derivative actions may be equitable actions, they are actions to protect private rights and to redress private wrongs; therefore they are civil actions under this section which guarantees that parties to such actions may have questions of fact tried by juries. Faircloth v. Beard, <cite class="nc_code">320 N.C. 505</cite>, 358 S.E.2d 512 (1987), overruled in part, Jacobs v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">137 N.C.

        Constitution of North Carolina expressly vested in the Supreme Court of North Carolina the exclusive authority to make rules of procedure and practice for the Appellate Division; although G.S. 8C-1-103(a)(2) was contained in the Rules of Evidence, it was manifestly an attempt to govern the procedure and practice of the Appellate Division as it purported to determine which issues were preserved for appellate review, and to the extent it conflicts with N.C. R. App. P. 10(b)(1), G.S. 8C-1-103(a)(2) failed. State v. Oglesby, <cite class="nc_code">361 N.C. 550</cite>, 648 S.E.2d 819 (2007).

      In all issues of fact joined in any court, the parties in any civil case may waive the right to have the issues determined by a jury, in which case the finding of the judge upon the facts shall have the force and effect of a verdict by a jury.

       The right to trial by jury in civil cases may be waived.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Manner of waiver of jury trial is controlled by statute.
   
   Holmes Elec. Co. v. Carolina Power &amp; Light Co., <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 766</cite>, 150 S.E. 621 (1929). See also, Green Sea Lumber Co. v. Pemberton, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 532</cite>, 125 S.E. 119 (1924).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver by Agreement.
   
   - Where case on appeal recited that the parties agreed that the court might render judgment out of term and out of the district, and the judgment recited the same, appellant's contention that trial by the court had not been agreed upon could not be sustained, since trial by jury would be impossible under the agreement that judgment might be rendered out of term and out of the district. Odom v. Palmer, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 93</cite>, 182 S.E. 741 (1935).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Waiver by Consent to Pay Additur.
   
   - While it may be suggested that the practice of additur deprives a defendant of his constitutional right to a jury trial, the obvious answer is that the defendant can waive that right, which he does when he consents to pay the additur, since in this State the parties to a civil action have a right to waive a jury trial. Caudle v. Swanson, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 249</cite>, 103 S.E.2d 357 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Attachment Proceedings.
   
   - In attachment and other ancillary proceedings it is competent for the court to find the facts from the affidavits and other evidence; and a party consenting to this mode of trial cannot afterwards demand a jury trial. Pasour v. Linberger, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. 159</cite> (1884).

      <p>
       Party with Right to Traverse Allegations Cannot Be Deprived of Jury Trial.
   
   - A party charged with the maintenance of a public nuisance has a right to traverse the factual allegations of the complaint. If he does so, he cannot be deprived of his right to a jury trial on the issues raised by the pleadings. State ex rel. Bowman v. Malloy, <cite class="nc_code">264 N.C. 396</cite>, 141 S.E.2d 796 (1965).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error for trial court to determine issues of fact
   
   raised by the pleadings in the absence of waiver of the constitutional and statutory right to a trial by jury, there being no question of reference. Sparks v. Sparks, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 492</cite>, 61 S.E.2d 356 (1950).
   <br />
      </p>

       Trial judge's findings of fact based upon a misapprehension
   
   of applicable law will be set aside on the theory that the evidence should be considered in its true legal light. Security Ins. Group v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 391</cite>, 222 S.E.2d 437 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge Had No Authority to Affirm Order of Assistant Clerk which Effectively Determined Issue of Fact.
   
   - Where there was nothing in the record to indicate that petitioner and respondent waived their constitutional and statutory rights to have the issue of fact joined on the pleadings tried by a jury, and there was no question of reference, the judge had no authority to enter an order affirming the order of the assistant clerk of the superior court, which in effect was a determination by the judge of the issue of fact raised by the pleadings and a finding by him that money deposited in the office of the clerk of the superior court was funds belonging to a decedent and an order that said money be distributed to the administrator c.t.a. of her last will and testament. In re Estate of Wallace, <cite class="nc_code">267 N.C. 204</cite>, 147 S.E.2d 922 (1966).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Findings of Trial Court Are Conclusive.
   
   - Where a jury trial is waived, the findings by the court upon conflicting evidence are conclusive under this section, and are not subject to review upon appeal. Barringer v. Wilmington Sav. &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 505</cite>, 177 S.E. 795 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       When the right to a jury trial is waived, the facts found by the judge have the force and effect of a verdict by a jury. Upon appropriate assignments of error the Supreme Court may examine the evidence to ascertain if there is any to support the verdict of a jury. It may likewise, upon appropriate assignments, ascertain if the verdict is sufficient to support the judgment, but it cannot enlarge or diminish findings which constitute the verdict. Cauble v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 722</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 557 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Supreme Court has the right to review findings of fact made with respect to interlocutory orders denying or granting injunctive relief. However, where the judgment is a final determination of the rights of the parties, the mere fact that equitable (injunctive) relief is granted gives the Supreme Court no authority to modify findings determinative of issues of fact raised by the pleadings. Cauble v. Bell, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 722</cite>, 107 S.E.2d 557 (1959).

        Election of Judges Not Required by Federal Constitution.

       - North Carolina could by her Constitution provide for the appointment of all State judges without violating any provision of the federal Constitution. The election of superior court judges is not a necessary characteristic of a republican form of government and is not required by the Constitution of the United States. This is a political rather than a judicial question. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

   under this section to vote for judges at the expiration of their eight-year terms of office; the right to vote per se is not a fundamental right under North Carolina's Constitution; instead, once the right to vote is conferred, the equal right to vote is a fundamental right. State ex rel. Martin v. Preston, <cite class="nc_code">325 N.C. 438</cite>, 385 S.E.2d 473 (1989).

       By enacting Session Laws 1987, c. 509, the legislature eliminated staggered terms within multi-seat judicial districts
   
   by creating a one-time interim or hiatus between certain terms of office; as the Constitution anticipates such "hold over" situations by providing that elected judges remain in office "until their successors are elected and qualified," the act was not unconstitutional.

        Validity of Superior Court Election, Rotation, and Residency Provisions.
       </b>
       - There can be no doubt as to the validity under the federal Constitution of the provisions of the North Carolina Constitution requiring the election of superior court judges by districts or statewide as prescribed by the legislature, or that the State be divided into divisions and districts and judges rotate among the districts, or that they reside in their respective districts. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).
      </p>
      <p>
       A superior court judge is a hybrid official with both local and statewide functions and authority. The requirement that he reside in the district from which he is elected is a matter of convenience, making him available to hear emergency matters, and convenience is an essential factor in arranging an effective judicial system. He rotates among the districts of his division, and may be assigned beyond his division by the Chief Justice. Thus, there is a reasonable basis for the election procedure requiring him to be nominated in the primary election and elected in the general election by statewide vote, and it serves and achieves a legitimate State purpose and is not arbitrary and capricious. Holshouser v. Scott, 335 F. Supp. 928 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 409 U.S. 807, 93 S. Ct. 43, 34 L. Ed. 2d 68 (1972).

      </h4>
      <p>
       Subsection (1) Provides Only for Removal from Office.
   
   - When a justice or judge is removed for incapacity, subsection (1) of this section imposes no sanction other than removal from office. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of Subsection (2).
   
   - The purpose of subsection (2) of this section is not so much to change the consequences of removal as it is to provide a "procedure in addition to impeachment and address" which will accomplish the goals which formerly could be accomplished only through the cumbersome and antiquated machinery of impeachment. It neither specifies a tribunal nor directs the creation of an authority for this purpose. It merely commands the legislature, in its discretion, to provide a new remedy as an adjunct to the cumbersome, ancient and impractical remedy of impeachment. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       Recognizing the need for a method of removal better than impeachment or address, the General Assembly, following the lead of many of the states, submitted subsection (2) as a constitutional amendment authorizing an additional method of removal of judges. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
      </p>
      <p>
       The mischief to be cured by subsection (2) of this section was the inefficiency of removal proceedings under the impeachment and address provisions of the Constitution, not the remedies. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (2) of this section must be read in connection with the impeachment provisions of this Article,
   
   which it was intended to supplement. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conferral of Original Jurisdiction Over Removal of Judges on Supreme Court.
   
   - Ratification of the amendment adding subsection (2) of this section carried with it an expression of the will of the people that the Constitution be amended so as to empower the legislature to confer upon the Supreme Court original jurisdiction over the censure and removal of judges. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       While subsection (2) of this section, which is a positive mandate to the legislature to provide a procedure in addition to impeachment for the removal and censure of judges and justices, does not expressly authorize the legislature to confer original jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court over the censure and removal of judges, by clear implication it grants to the legislature authority to confer such jurisdiction upon the Supreme Court. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       Proceedings before the North Carolina State Bar Disciplinary Hearing Commission to discipline a sitting judge were dismissed because only the North Carolina Supreme Court or the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission had jurisdiction to discipline sitting judges for conduct in office. N.C. State Bar v. Tillett, <cite class="nc_code">369 N.C. 264</cite>, 794 S.E.2d 743 (2016).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Disqualification for Causes Other than Disability Authorized.
   
   - Subsection (2) of this section authorizes the General Assembly to disqualify from holding further judicial office a justice or judge who has been removed for causes other than mental or physical disability. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Codes of judicial conduct may usefully be consulted
   
   to give meaning to the constitutional standards. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Conduct Is Prejudicial to Administration of Justice.
   
   - Whether the conduct of a judge may be characterized as prejudicial to the administration of justice and bringing the judicial office into disrepute depends not so much upon the judge's motives but more on the conduct itself, the results thereof and the impact such conduct might reasonably have upon knowledgeable observers. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Personal Benefit Irrelevant.
   
   - Whether a judge receives any personal benefit from his conduct is wholly irrelevant to an inquiry into the conduct of a judicial officer. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that a judge received no personal benefit, financial or otherwise, from his conduct does not preclude his conduct from being prejudicial to the administration of justice and bringing the judicial office into disrepute. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Disposition of cases for reasons other than an honest appraisal
   
   of the facts and the law, as disclosed by the evidence presented, will amount to conduct prejudicial to the proper administration of justice whenever and however it may be defined or whoever does the defining. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Judge's execution judgments, allowing limited driving privileges under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.020.html#t20a03s20-179" target="_blank">G.S. 20-179</a></cite> upon a mere ex parte request
   
   without making any effort or conducting any inquiry to ascertain whether the facts recited in the judgments were true and whether he was lawfully entitled to enter the judgments, and without giving the State an opportunity to be heard, when in truth the judgments were supported neither in fact nor in law and were beyond the judge's jurisdiction to enter, constituted a gross abuse of important provisions of the motor vehicle statutes and amounted to conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute. In re Crutchfield, <cite class="nc_code">289 N.C. 597</cite>, 223 S.E.2d 822 (1975).

   - In view of the constitutional mandate in subsection (2) of this section that the General Assembly shall prescribe a procedure for the censure and removal of judges in addition to impeachment and address as provided in subsection (1), respondent's contention that the General Assembly, in enacting Article 30 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite> (G.S. 7A-375 et seq.), abrogated its legislative duties by unconstitutionally delegating them to the Judicial Standards Commission, a creature of the General Assembly, was without merit. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       Article 30 of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite> (G.S. 7A-375 et seq.) is not unconstitutional because enacted in advance of the ratification of this section, since the General Assembly has the power to enact a statute not authorized by the present Constitution where the statute is passed in anticipation of an amendment authorizing it or provides that it shall take effect upon the adoption of such an amendment. In re Nowell, <cite class="nc_code">293 N.C. 235</cite>, 237 S.E.2d 246 (1977).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Judicial Standards Commission Act, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7A</a></cite>, Article 30 (G.S. 7A-375 et seq.) is constitutional and, under that Article, the Supreme Court is vested with jurisdiction to act in a case involving the removal from office of a judge. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Supreme Court Action Pursuant to Such Authority Does Not Violate Constitution.
   
   - By accepting and acting upon the original jurisdiction authorized by the people under subsection (2) of this section and conferred by the legislature, the Supreme Court does not usurp power constitutionally reserved to another branch of government. Thus, the exercise of such jurisdiction does not violate the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 291</cite>, 245 S.E.2d 766 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Grounds for suspension or removal of a magistrate
   
   are the same as for a judge of the General Court of Justice. In re Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 206, 484 S.E.2d 441 (1997).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Magistrate properly removed from office for engaging in willful misconduct in office and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice that brings the judicial office into disrepute
   
   where he aided and abetted a minor in the possession of alcohol. In re Kiser, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 206, 484 S.E.2d 441 (1997).

      </h4>
      <p>
       A solicitor (now district attorney) is the most responsible officer of the court
   
   and has been spoken of as its "right arm." He is a constitutional officer and his duties are presented by the Constitution. State v. McAfee, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 320</cite>, 127 S.E. 204 (1925); State v. Carden, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 404</cite>, 183 S.E. 898, cert. denied, 298 U.S. 682, 56 S. Ct. 960, 80 L.

   23, Const. 1868, prior to the 1962 revision of the article.
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The clear mandate of this section
   
   is that the responsibility and authority to prosecute all criminal actions in the superior courts is vested solely in the several district attorneys of the State. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Delegation of Prosecutorial Function.
   
   - The elected district attorney may, in his or her discretion and where otherwise permitted by law, delegate the prosecutorial function to others. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Discretion of District Attorney.
   
   - While the district attorney has broad discretion to decide in a homicide case whether to try defendant for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter, he/she has no discretion whether to try defendant capitally or noncapitally for first-degree murder. State v. Rorie, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 266</cite>, 500 S.E.2d 77 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       District Attorney's Lack of Discretion in Capital Cases Not Unconstitutional.
   
   - Section 15A-2000 does not conflict with this section; in other words, the district attorney's lack of discretion as to whether to try a defendant capitally or noncapitally for first-degree murder does not impermissibly conflict with the prosecutor's constitutional duty to prosecute criminal actions on behalf of the State, although he does have broad discretion in a homicide case to determine whether to try a defendant for first-degree murder, second-degree murder, or manslaughter. State v. Blakeney, <cite class="nc_code">352 N.C. 287</cite>, 531 S.E.2d 799 (2000), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1117, 121 S. Ct. 868, 148 L. Ed. 2d 780 (2001).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Public Nuisances.
   
   - The State, through the district attorney, has not only the authority, but also as an advocate of the State's interest in protecting society, an implied duty to bring public nuisance actions. Whitfield v. Gilchrist, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. App.</cite> 241, 485 S.E.2d 61 (1997), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 39</cite>, 497 S.E.2d 412 (1998).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Authority of Trial Court Exceeded.
   
   - The trial court exceeded its authority and invaded the province of an independent constitutional officer when it ordered the district attorney to request that the Attorney General prosecute defendant in a capital case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>
       The trial court exceeded its authority by ordering that in order to avoid the possibility or impression of any conflict of interest, the district attorney and his entire staff must withdraw from a capital case and have no further participation either directly or indirectly with regard to the case. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).
   <br />

   - <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa09s7A-66" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-66</a></cite> does not violate the Constitution of North Carolina; the superior court had jurisdiction to remove district attorney. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).

   it is apparent that our Constitution and statutes give the district attorneys of the State the exclusive discretion and authority to determine whether to request, and thus permit, the prosecution of any individual case by the Special Prosecution Division. State v. Camacho, <cite class="nc_code">329 N.C. 589</cite>, 406 S.E.2d 868 (1991).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Standing to Challenge District Attorney's Participation.
   
   - Magistrate did not have standing to challenge involvement of the District Attorney in magistrate's removal proceeding, where, had trial court the inherent authority to appoint an independent counsel, magistrate could not show that a different result would have occurred. In re Ezzell, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. App.</cite> 388, 438 S.E.2d 482 (1994).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Removal of District Attorneys.
   
   - Neither this section nor any other provision of the Constitution of North Carolina prohibits the General Assembly from enacting a statutory method for the removal of district attorneys from office, so long as district attorneys whose removal from office is sought are accorded due process of law. In re Spivey, <cite class="nc_code">345 N.C. 404</cite>, 480 S.E.2d 693 (1997).

       <b>
        Legislature's Authority to Prescribe Duties for District Attorneys.
       </b>
       - There was no state law that would allow a city to delegate its policymaking authority to a state prosecutor, and, pursuant to N.C. Const., Art. IV,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       18(1), only the state legislature had authority to prescribe duties for District Attorneys or supervise the District Attorney's exercise of authority; thus, the claims against a prosecutor in his "official capacity" were claims against the State. McFadyen v. Duke Univ., 786 F. Supp. 2d 887 (M.D.N.C. Mar. 31, 2011), aff'd and rev'd in part, 703 F.3d 636 (2012).
      </p>
      <p>
       Employment of Private Counsel.
   
   - A district attorney's decision to employ private counsel to assist the district attorney in bringing a public nuisance action in the name of the State is similar to a district attorney's decision to permit a private attorney to assist in a criminal action; thus, the state constitution and this section, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsIIIa09s7A-61" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-61</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.147.html#t147a08s147-89" target="_blank">G.S. 147-89</a></cite> do not prohibit employing private counsel.

       Exclusive Jurisdiction to Prosecute Criminal Actions.
   
   - The authority to prosecute criminal actions in North Carolina courts rests exclusively with the district attorneys of the State. In re 1990 Red Cherokee Jeep, <cite class="nc_code">131 N.C. App.</cite> 108, 505 S.E.2d 588 (1998).

        A layman serving as a District Court Judge on and prior to January 1, 1981,

       may resign or not seek reelection and still be qualified as a candidate for judge in a subsequent election under this section. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Arnold O. Jones, District Court Judge, Eighth District, 50 N.C.A.G. 107 (1981).

       A layman serving as a District Court Judge on and prior to January 1, 1981, is eligible for appointment or election to the Office of Judge of the Superior Court.
   See opinion of Attorney General to The Honorable Arnold O. Jones, District Court Judge, 1998 N.C.A.G. 27 (6/23/98).

       <b>
        Interpretation of first sentence.
       </b>
       - The language of the first sentence of Sec. 22 of Art. IV of the NC Const. is unambiguous. No person is eligible for election or appointment as a justice or judge unless that person is duly authorized to practice law in the courts of this state. That is the only qualification mandated by Sec. 22. The second sentence exempts from this requirement those persons elected to or serving in such capacities on or before January 1, 1981. See opinion of Attorney General to Honorable Jim Gulley, Representative, 2009 N.C.A.G. 4 (09/16/09).

       <b>
        Interpretation of second sentence.
       </b>
       - The second sentence of Sec. 22 of Art. IV of the NC Const. is a complete "grandfather" clause, exempting any person elected to or serving as a judge or justice on or before January 1, 1981. The exemption applies during any such person's life time and forever exempts them from Sec. 22. If a person was not elected to or serving as a judge or justice on or before January 1, 1981, that person must be duly authorized to practice law in the courts of this state to be eligible for election or appointment as a Justice of the Supreme Court, Judge of the Court of Appeals, Judge of the Superior Court, or Judge of District Court.

      <li id="constitution-wya0Vs02ol11">
       Power of taxation. The power of taxation shall be exercised in a just and equitable manner, for public purposes only, and shall never be surrendered, suspended, or contracted away.
      </li>
      <li id="constitution-wya0Vs02ol12">
       Classification. Only the General Assembly shall have the power to classify property for taxation, which power shall be exercised only on a State-wide basis and shall not be delegated. No class of property shall be taxed except by uniform rule, and every classification shall be made by general law uniformly applicable in every county, city and town, and other unit of local government.
      </li>
      <li id="constitution-wya0Vs02ol13">
       Exemptions. Property belonging to the State, counties, and municipal corporations shall be exempt from taxation. The General Assembly may exempt cemeteries and property held for educational, scientific, literary, cultural, charitable, or religious purposes, and, to a value not exceeding $300, any personal property. The General Assembly may exempt from taxation not exceeding $1,000 in value of property held and used as the place of residence of the owner. Every exemption shall be on a State-wide basis and shall be made by general law uniformly applicable in every county, city and town, and other unit of local government. No taxing authority other than the General Assembly may grant exemptions, and the General Assembly shall not delegate the powers accorded to it by this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="constitution-wya0Vs02ol14">
       Special tax areas. Subject to the limitations imposed by Section 4, the General Assembly may enact general laws authorizing the governing body of any county, city, or town to define territorial areas and to levy taxes within those areas, in addition to those levied throughout the county, city, or town, in order to finance, provide, or maintain services, facilities, and functions in addition to or to a greater extent than those financed, provided, or maintained for the entire county, city, or town.
      </li>
      <li id="constitution-wya0Vs02ol15">
       Purposes of property tax. The General Assembly shall not authorize any county, city or town, special district, or other unit of local government to levy taxes on property, except for purposes authorized by general law uniformly applicable throughout the State, unless the tax is approved by a majority of the qualified voters of the unit who vote thereon.
      </li>
      <li id="constitution-wya0Vs02ol16">
       Income tax. The rate of tax on incomes shall not in any case exceed seven percent, and there shall be allowed personal exemptions and deductions so that only net incomes are taxed.
      </li>
      <li id="constitution-wya0Vs02ol17">
       Contracts. The General Assembly may enact laws whereby the State, any county, city or town, and any other public corporation may contract with and appropriate money to any person, association, or corporation for the accomplishment of public purposes only.

        Applicability of Limitations.
   
   - For case holding that limitations similar to those in subsections (1) to (3) of this section relate solely to the taxation of real and personal property, and are irrelevant in respect of the validity of a local sales and use tax act, see Sykes v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 398</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 775 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The equality and uniformity required by the State Constitution in property taxation does not apply to inheritance or succession taxation. Rigby v.

       </p>
       <p>
        For case holding that the requirement of uniformity extends to license, franchise and other forms of taxation, see Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

        Taxes and Local Assessments for Public Improvements Distinguished.
   
   - There is a distinction between local assessments for public improvements and taxes levied for purposes of general revenue. It is true that local assessments may be a species of tax, and that the authority to levy them is generally referred to the taxing power, but they are not taxes within the meaning of that term as generally understood in constitutional restrictions and exemptions. Southern Ry. v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 305, 176 S.E.2d 21 (1970), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 709</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 422 (1971).

        Laches as Bar to Constitutional Challenge to 1970 Amendments.
   
   - Where more than 18 years elapsed between the 1970 ballot and the defendants' claim of unconstitutionality of the 1970 amendments and where taxpayer stated that he did not recognize the effects of the amendment until his taxes rose in 1985, he did not claim that he was precluded from ascertaining the import of the amendment or the constitutionality of its passage before 1985, or until January 8, 1989, when he filed his answer, a county was materially prejudiced by the defendants' delay because the passage of time prevented the county from presenting evidence supporting the fact that the ballot was understandable to voters.

         II. POWER OF TAXATION.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A sovereign state, as one of its inherent attributes, has the power of taxation,
   
   which must be exercised by its legislative branch. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A county is not a sovereign and does not have inherent power to levy taxes.
   
   A county must derive its taxing power from the State Constitution or from the State's legislative enactments. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A county board of elections does not have taxing power.
   
   Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to levy taxes is the exclusive province of the legislature,
   
   and the superior court has no jurisdiction of an action, the nature and purpose of which is to discover, to list and to assess for taxation, property which has escaped taxation. Henderson County v. Smyth, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 421</cite>, 5 S.E.2d 136 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section of the Constitution vests exclusive authority in the legislature to levy taxes, which may not be interfered with by the courts. Person v. Board of State Tax Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">184 N.C. 499</cite>, 115 S.E. 336 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this Article the power to levy taxes vests exclusively in the legislative branch of the government; and it is within the exclusive power of the General Assembly to provide the method and prescribe the procedure for discovery, listing and assessing property for taxation. DeLoatch v. Beamon, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 754</cite>, 114 S.E.2d 711 (1960).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (1) is a limitation upon the legislative power,
   
   separate and apart from the limitation contained in the law of the land clause in N.C. Const., Art. I,

        City's Privilege License Tax Was Presumed Valid.
   
   - City's privilege license tax on businesses was presumed valid because, (1) under the current state of the law, the activity to be taxed was legal, and (2) the city, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa09s160A-211" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-211</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia02s105-109" target="_blank">G.S. 105-109</a></cite>, had the authority to enact an ordinance imposing the tax.

       <p>
        Prejudice Not Shown.
   
   - Taxpayers did not show that they had standing to challenge the economic incentives that the state and local governments gave to the business to locate its computer manufacturing facility in the county, under either the Uniformity of Taxation Clauses, N.C. Const., Art. V,

   <span class="s1">

   8, cl. 3, as the taxpayers did not show that they were prejudiced and the legislation producing the incentives, such as tax credits, promoted the permissible governmental goal of providing economic incentives to recruit business to the state in order to benefit the public. Blinson v. State, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. App.</cite> 328, 651 S.E.2d 268 (2007), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">362 N.C. 355</cite>, 661 S.E.2d 240 (2008).

       </p>
       <p>
        Just and Equitable Clause Violated.
   
   - Increase in a city's minimum privilege license tax of 8,900 percent violated the Just and Equitable Tax Clause of the North Carolina Constitution since it was wholly detached from the moorings of anything reasonably resembling a just and equitable tax. Smith v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. App.</cite> 563, 743 S.E.2d 662, dismissed and review denied, 748 S.E.2d 558, <cite class="nc_code">367 N.C. 238</cite>, 2013 N.C.

       <p>
        The "public purpose" requirement acts as a limitation
   
   equally upon the power to tax and the power to appropriate and expend public funds. Hughey v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 245 S.E.2d 543 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 86</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 898 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Meaning of "Public Purpose".
   
   - A tax or an appropriation is for a public purpose if it is for the support of the government, or for any of the recognized objects of the government. Green v. Kitchin, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 450</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 545 (1948), discussed in 27 N.C.L. Rev. 500; Jamison v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The term "public purpose," when used in connection with the expenditure of municipal funds from the public treasury, refers to such public purpose within the frame of governmental and proprietary power given to the particular municipality, to be exercised for the benefit, welfare and protection of its inhabitants and others coming within the municipal care. It involves reasonable connection with the convenience and necessity of the particular municipality whose aid is extended in its promotion. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 1</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 803 (1946); Nash v. Town of Tarboro, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 283</cite>, 42 S.E.2d 209 (1947).

        The term "public purposes" is employed in the same sense in the law of taxation and in the law of eminent domain. Thus, if the General Assembly may authorize a State agency to expend public money for the purpose of aiding in the construction of a hospital facility to be leased to and ultimately conveyed to a private agency, it may also authorize the acquisition of a site for such facility by exercise of the power of eminent domain. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).

        Although Mitchell v. North Carolina Indus. Dev. Fin. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 137</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 745 (1968), and its progeny remain pivotal in the development of the doctrine, they do not purport to establish a permanent test for determining the existence of a public purpose. Maready v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">342 N.C. 708</cite>, 467 S.E.2d 615 (1996).

        Concept of "Public Purpose" Expands with Changing Conditions.
   
   - A slide-rule definition to determine the meaning of "public purpose" for all time cannot be formulated; the concept expands with the population, economy, scientific knowledge, and changing conditions. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970); In re Denial of Approval to Issue Hous. Bonds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 52</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 281 (1982).

       <p>
        For a use to be public its benefits must be in common and not for particular persons,
   
   interests, or estates; the ultimate net gain or advantage must be the public's, as contradistinguished from that of an individual or private entity. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970); In re Denial of Approval to Issue Hous. Bonds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 52</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 281 (1982).

        The power to appropriate money from the public treasury is no greater than the power to levy the tax
   
   which put the money in the treasury. Both powers are subject to the constitutional proscription that tax revenues may not be used for private individuals or corporations, no matter how benevolent. Mitchell v. North Carolina Indus. Dev. Fin. Auth., <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 137</cite>, 159 S.E.2d 745 (1968); Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970); Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).

        Fact that moneys are paid to an individual does not affect the character of the expenditure,
   
   since the object of the expenditure and not to whom it is paid determines whether it is for a public purpose. Green v. Kitchin, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 450</cite>, 50 S.E.2d 545 (1948), discussed in 27 N.C.L. Rev. 500 (1949).

        When Direct Disbursement of Public Funds to Private Entity Is Permissible.
   
   - Under subsection (7) of this section, direct disbursement of public funds to private entities is a constitutionally permissible means of accomplishing a public purpose, provided there is statutory authority to make such appropriation. Hughey v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 86</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 898 (1979).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Direct Assistance to Private School Is Not Permissible.
   
   - Direct assistance to private entities such as the Dyslexia School of North Carolina, Inc., distinguishable from direct disbursements to students for educational purposes, may not be the means used to effect a public purpose. Hughey v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 245 S.E.2d 543 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 86</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 898 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the Dyslexia School of North Carolina, Inc., a private nonprofit corporation, is engaged in a clearly benevolent activity, which would not be constitutionally prohibited if provided through the public schools of Gaston County, it remains a private entity. As such, it may not receive appropriations and expenditures from public funds of Gaston County in order to achieve the desirable and commendable end of assisting in the education of the dyslexic children of Gaston County. Hughey v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">37 N.C. App.</cite> 107, 245 S.E.2d 543 (1978), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">297 N.C. 86</cite>, 253 S.E.2d 898 (1979).

       <p>
        Legislature Initially Determines What Is Public Purpose.
   
   - The initial responsibility for determining what is and what is not a public purpose rests with the legislature, and its findings with reference thereto are entitled to great weight. In re Denial of Approval to Issue Hous. Bonds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 52</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 281 (1982).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative Declarations Are Not Conclusive.
   
   - A legislative declaration which asserts in general terms that the statute under consideration is enacted for a public purpose, although entitled to great weight, is not conclusive. When the facts are determined, what is a public purpose is a question of law for the court. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        If an enactment is in fact for a private purpose, and therefore unconstitutional, it cannot be saved by legislative declarations to the contrary. When a constitutional question is properly presented, it is the duty of the court to ascertain and declare the intent of the framers of the Constitution, and to reject any legislative act which is in conflict therewith. In re Denial of Approval to Issue Hous. Bonds, <cite class="nc_code">307 N.C. 52</cite>, 296 S.E.2d 281 (1982).

       <p>
        Duty of Supreme Court to Determine Constitutionality of Appropriation.
   
   - It is the duty and prerogative of the Supreme Court to determine whether an appropriation of tax funds is for a purpose forbidden by the Constitution of the State when that question is properly raised. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).

   1, and is void because the purpose for which the corporation was created is not a public purpose, then a taxpayer may maintain an action to restrain state officials from paying to the corporation and the corporation from using money appropriated out of the General Fund.

        Financing of a Competitive Basketball Team and Public Auditorium.

        Hospital.

       </p>
       <p>
        The expenditure of tax funds for the construction of a general county hospital is for a public purpose; and a county, when authorized by the General Assembly and with the approval of a majority of the voters, has as much right to issue its bonds to provide hospital facilities for those citizens who are able to pay for the services rendered to them as it does to provide such facilities for the sick and afflicted poor. Trustees of Rex Hosp. v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 312</cite>, 79 S.E.2d 892 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        The expenditure of tax funds for the construction of a hospital to be owned and operated by the State, a county, a city, a town or some other political subdivision of the State is an expenditure for a public purpose, but the expenditure of public funds raised by taxation to finance or facilitate the financing of the construction of a hospital facility to be privately operated, managed and controlled is not an expenditure for a public purpose and is thus prohibited by this section. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The construction and operation of a privately owned hospital is not necessarily for a public purpose within the meaning of the constitutional limitation upon the use of tax funds, and the circumstance that the privately owned hospital is not operated for profit is not determinative.

        Municipal Airport.
   
   - Construction and maintenance of a municipal airport for a city of more than 10,000 inhabitants, engaged in many industries and pursuits, is for a public purpose within the meaning of this section, and no right guaranteed by U.S. Const., Amend. XIV will be injuriously affected thereby. Turner v. City of Reidsville, <cite class="nc_code">224 N.C. 42</cite>, 29 S.E.2d 211 (1944); City of Reidsville v.

        Opportunity Scholarship Program.
   
   - Appropriations made by the General Assembly for the Opportunity Scholarship Program are for a public purpose because the ultimate beneficiary of providing these children additional educational opportunities is our collective citizenry; the provision of monetary assistance to lower-income families so that their children have additional educational opportunities is well within the scope of permissible governmental action and is intimately related to the needs of our state's citizenry.

       </p>
       <p>
        The principles of equality and uniformity are indispensable to taxation, whether general or local. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniformity, in its legal and proper sense, is inseparably incident to the exercise of the power of taxation. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A "tax" within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition against nonuniformity
   
   of taxation is a charge levied and collected as a contribution to the maintenance of the general government. It is imposed upon the citizens in common, at regularly recurring periods, for the purpose of providing a continuous revenue. State ex rel. Dorothea Dix Hosp. v.

        Although it is not expressly provided that the tax on trades, etc., shall be uniform, yet a tax not uniform, as properly understood, would be so inconsistent with natural justice, and with the intent which is apparent in the Constitution that it may be admitted that the collection of such a tax would be restricted as unconstitutional. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).

        Although the uniformity requirement is literally confined to taxes on property, it extends to license, franchise and other taxes. First Carolina Investors v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 337 S.E.2d 691 (1985).

Currie, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 129</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 543, appeal dismissed, 368 U.S. 289, 82 S. Ct. 375, 7 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1961).

        The requirements of "uniformity," "equal protection," and "due process" are, for all practical purposes, the same under both the State and federal Constitutions. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />

       <p>
        When Tax Is Uniform.
   
   - A tax is uniform when it is equal upon all persons belonging to the described class upon which it is imposed. Gatlin v. Town of Tarboro, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. 119</cite> (1878); State v. Danenberg, <cite class="nc_code">151 N.C. 718</cite>, 66 S.E. 301, 26 L.R.A. (n.s.) 890 (1909); Leonard v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 89</cite>, 3 S.E.2d 316, appeal dismissed, 308 U.S. 516, 60 S. Ct. 175, 84 L. Ed. 439 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxing is required to be by a uniform rule, that is, by one and the same unvarying standard. Uniformity in taxing implies equality in the burden of taxation, and this equality of burden cannot exist without uniformity in the mode of assessment, as well as in the rate of taxation. But this is not all. The uniformity must be coextensive with the territory to which it applies. If a State tax, it must be uniform all over the State. If a county or city tax, it must be uniform throughout the extent of the territory to which it is applicable. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniformity consists in putting the same tax upon all of the same class; that is, while the same tax must be enforced upon all innkeepers, upon all railroads, and so on throughout, a tax discriminating among persons of the same class, whereby some are required to pay more than others, would lack uniformity. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equality within the class or for those of like station and condition is all that is required to meet the test of constitutionality under subsection (2) of this section. A tax on trades, etc., must be considered uniform when it is equal upon all persons belonging to the prescribed class upon which it is imposed. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniformity of taxation is accomplished when the tax is levied equally and uniformly on all subjects in the same class, and the right to classify imports a difference in the subjects of taxation. Smith v. State, <cite class="nc_code">349 N.C. 332</cite>, 507 S.E.2d 28 (1998).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniformity with Reference to Locality and Classification.
   
   - With reference to locality, a tax is uniform when it operates with equal force and effect in every place where the subject of it is found, and with reference to classification, it is uniform when it operates without distinction or discrimination upon all persons composing the described class. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section uniformity in taxation relates to equality in the burden
   
   of the State's taxpayers. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 66</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 766 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not prohibit reasonable flexibility and variety
   
   appropriate to reasonable schemes of State taxation. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 66</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 766 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Scientific Uniformity Is Not Required.
   
   - The State may impose different specific taxes upon different trades and professions and may vary the rate of excise upon various products. It is not required to resort to close distinctions or to maintain a precise, scientific uniformity with reference to composition, use or value. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 66</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 766 (1974).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule of uniformity is observed if the rate is uniform throughout each taxing authority's jurisdiction.
   
   State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniformity of taxation, as provided for by State Constitution, is required throughout the territorial limits of the taxing district. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Local taxation must be uniform upon the same class of subjects within the territorial limits
   
   of the authority levying the tax. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule of uniformity is not violated by double taxation from taxes levied by different authorities
   
   if each authority adheres to the uniformity rule in its levies. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Tax on City Property and on County Property Including Property in City.
   
   - The imposition of a tax on county property, including property within a city situated therein, to provide funds for county library purposes, and the imposition of a tax within the city to provide funds for municipal library purposes, does not violate this section, notwithstanding that a greater burden of taxation will be placed on the taxpayers of the municipality, nor does it constitute double taxation, since one tax will be imposed by the city for municipal purposes and the other by the county for county purposes. Further, double taxation is prohibited by neither the State nor federal Constitutions. Jamison v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 682</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 904 (1954).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Creation of Tax Districts Not Precluded by Rule of Uniformity.
   
   - Sometimes it is deemed wise to create a tax district for special purposes, generally for public improvements, such as for highway taxes, bridge taxes, drainage taxes, or the like, and to fix the boundaries of such district so as to include two or more counties or towns or even to make the district wholly independent of such political boundaries. Taxing districts may be as numerous as the purposes for which taxes are levied. Equality and uniformity of taxation does not preclude the power of the State to create separate taxing districts, provided the taxes are equal and uniform within each taxing district. State ex rel. Dyer v. City of Leaksville, <cite class="nc_code">275 N.C. 41</cite>, 165 S.E.2d 201 (1969).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Wide Latitude Accorded Taxing Authorities.
   
   - The power to classify subjects of taxation carries with it the discretion to select them, and a wide latitude is accorded taxing authorities, particularly in respect of occupational taxes, under the power conferred by this section. Charlotte Coca-Cola Bottling Co. v. Shaw, <cite class="nc_code">232 N.C. 307</cite>, 59 S.E.2d 819 (1950); Lenoir Fin. Co. v. Currie, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. 129</cite>, 118 S.E.2d 543, appeal dismissed, 368 U.S. 289, 82 S. Ct. 375, 7 L. Ed. 2d 336 (1961); Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretion in Classification.
   
   - The power to classify subjects of taxation carries with it the discretion to select them, and a wide latitude is accorded taxing authorities. In re Champion Int'l Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 639, 329 S.E.2d 691, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 540</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 15 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonableness of Classification.
   
   - The classification must not be arbitrary or unjust, but must be based on substantial and reasonable differences between the classes. Great Atl. &amp; Pac. Tea Co. v. Doughton, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 145</cite>, 144 S.E. 701 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of the legislature to classify subjects for the purpose of taxation is flexible, and the reasonableness of any classification will generally be construed with reference to the facts of the particular case, the predominant limitation on the power to classify being that the classification must be reasonable and not arbitrary and must rest upon some substantial difference between the classes, and that the burden must be equal upon all in the same class. Southern Grain Provision Co. v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 661</cite>, 155 S.E. 557 (1930).
       </p>
       <p>
        The classification of subjects for taxation must be based upon reasonable distinctions and must apply equally to all within each class defined. Snyder v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 617</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 19 (1940). See also, C.D. Kenny Co. v. Town of Brevard, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 269</cite>, 7 S.E.2d 542 (1940), as to municipal taxes on trades and professions.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the General Assembly may not establish a classification that is arbitrary or capricious, a classification is constitutional if it is founded upon a reasonable distinction or difference and bears a substantial relation to the object of the legislation. In re Martin, <cite class="nc_code">286 N.C. 66</cite>, 209 S.E.2d 766 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The only limitation upon the power of classification is that the classification be founded upon reasonable, and not arbitrary, distinctions. In re Champion Int'l Corp., <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. App.</cite> 639, 329 S.E.2d 691, cert. denied and appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 540</cite>, 335 S.E.2d 15 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        A classification will be upheld if it is reasonable and not arbitrary and rests upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced will be treated alike. First Carolina Investors v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 337 S.E.2d 691 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        On review, wide latitude is accorded the General Assembly; the only limitation on its power is that the classification must be founded upon reasonable, and not arbitrary, distinctions. State v. Rippy, <cite class="nc_code">80 N.C. App.</cite> 232, 341 S.E.2d 98 (1986).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts to Determine Validity of Classifications.
   
   - The uniformity rule of this section requires the courts, when the validity of a tax statute is challenged on the ground of discrimination, to ascertain if in fact there is a difference in the classes taxed. First Carolina Investors v. Lynch, <cite class="nc_code">78 N.C. App.</cite> 583, 337 S.E.2d 691 (1985).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Local Assessment Based on Benefits.
   
   - The constitutional provision that taxation shall be equal, uniform, and (under previous constitutions provisions) within certain limits does not apply to local assessments imposed upon owners of property, who in respect to such ownership are to derive a special benefit in the local improvements for which the tax is expended. Cain v. Commissioners of Davie County, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 8</cite> (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        While assessments on lands abutting on improved streets are not required to be uniform with all other subjects of taxation, and in view of the particular benefits, such must be uniform as to all property owners within that class to meet the constitutional requirements. City of Gastonia v. Cloninger, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 765</cite>, 123 S.E. 76 (1924).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Property Is Taxable Without Regard to Ownership.
   
   - By virtue of the provisions of this section, all property, real and personal, in this State, is subject to taxation, in accordance with a uniform rule, under laws which the General Assembly is required by the Constitution to enact, without regard to its ownership, and without regard to the purposes for which specific property is held, unless it is exempted by or under the provisions of this section. Latta v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">200 N.C. 255</cite>, 156 S.E. 857 (1931); Salisbury Hosp. v. Rowan County, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 8</cite>, 169 S.E. 805 (1933).

   was not within the zone of interest intended to be protected by this section; accordingly, that county could not contend that the provisions of former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105sIIa12s105-281" target="_blank">G.S. 105-281</a></cite> violated principles of uniformity.

        Additional Sales Tax in Certain Counties.
   
   - The Constitution does not permit State to levy a tax which discriminates in favor of or against taxpayers in the same classification, and this prohibition extends throughout the State. Hence, the State may not levy a tax in 25 counties and exempt 75 counties. Nor may the State set up a valid scheme by which that precise result is accomplished. Thus, additional 1% sales and use tax authorized by the Local Option Sales and Use Tax Act, which was a State tax, not a county tax, was unconstitutional since it was not uniformly applied to all taxpayers of the same class in all counties of the State. Hajoca Corp. v. Clayton, <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 560</cite>, 178 S.E.2d 481 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Levy imposed by the Local Option Sales and Use Tax Act was discriminatory in that it required one person to pay the tax involved and exempted his competitor in a county which voted against the tax. Both Nash and Edgecombe were exempt if either voted against the tax. Uniformity is required. No provision was made for partial uniformity, and for that reason the tax authorized under former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105s0Ia05s105-164.45" target="_blank">G.S. 105-164.45</a></cite> was unconstitutional.

        Leasehold Interests in Government Owned Croplands and Forestlands.

        Requiring Railroads and Like Corporations to Pay State Taxes Earlier.
   
   - Provisions requiring railroads and other like corporations to pay their State taxes within a shorter period than those to the counties is a uniform legislative classification applying equally to all within its terms and is not objectionable as discriminatory or as a denial of the equal protection of the laws prohibited by this section.

   - A tax levied quarterly by a town, under authority of an act of the General Assembly, upon all traders doing business in the town, of $1.00 for every $1,000.00 worth of goods sold during the preceding quarter, was uniform and constitutional.

   - An act imposing an annual graduated license tax on the business of buying and selling fresh meats from offices, stores, vehicles, etc., in cities of 12,000, 8,000, and under 8,000 inhabitants, respectively, is not unconstitutional, as not being uniform and in not imposing a license if the business is carried on outside a city or town; it being uniform as to all within each class.

        Tax on Receipt of Proceeds of Life Insurance Policy.
   
   - Public Laws 1937, c. 127, G.S. 11, could not be construed as imposing an excise tax upon the receipt of the proceeds of life insurance policies issued to the beneficiary who retained all rights and liabilities thereunder, in addition to imposing an inheritance tax on the proceeds of policies issued to the insured or in which he retained some incidents of ownership, since such excise tax would have to be computed in accordance with a graduated scale on the basis of the amount of insurance together with the value of the estate or the legacy or the distributive share, and thus would produce inequality in the levying of such excise tax in contravention of this section.

        Exemption of Farm Products.
   
   - The exception of farm products purchased from the producer from the return required to be made by merchants and other dealers as the basis for a license tax is not a discrimination against the products or citizens of other states; nor is it in violation of this section, which requires uniformity of taxation. State v. Stevenson, <cite class="nc_code">109 N.C. 730</cite>, 14 S.E. 385 (1891); Ex parte Brown, 48 F. 435 (E.D.N.C. 1891).

        Business of Hauling Timber.
   
   - An act requiring a license of anyone who carries on the business of hauling timber in a certain county, grading the license with reference to the number of horses driven to the wagon used, is not repugnant to this section. State v. Bullock, <cite class="nc_code">161 N.C. 223</cite>, 75 S.E. 942 (1912).

        Dealers in Different Kinds of Merchandise.
   
   - The requirement of this section that all taxes shall be uniform does not prohibit a municipality, which is empowered to tax persons engaged in merchantile business, from classifying dealers in a particular kind of merchandise separately from those whose business it is to sell other articles falling within the same generic terms.

        Fireman's Pension Fund.
   
   - Session Laws 1957, c. 1420, creating the North Carolina Fireman's Pension Fund, violated this section for lack of uniformity, in that it exempted members of the Farmers' Mutual Fire Insurance Association from adding the tax imposed by the act to their premiums and collecting it from purchasers of their insurance, as other companies selling similar insurance were required to do by the act. American Equitable Assurance Co. v. Gold, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 461</cite>, 106 S.E.2d 875 (1959); In re North Carolina Fire Ins.

       <p>
        Hotelkeepers.
   
   - A tax is uniform and consistent with this section when it is equal on all persons in the same class; and hence a tax imposed on hotelkeepers, which exempts from taxation those whose yearly receipts are less than $1,000.00, is not unconstitutional. Cobb v. Commissioners of Durham County, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 307</cite>, 30 S.E. 338 (1898).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Household Property.
   
   - Because there is some reasonable relationship between the value of a home and the value of the household property within, the percentage method is a reasonable one in accomplishing the object of determining the market value of household property, and thus there is no violation of subsection (2) of this section. In re Bosley, <cite class="nc_code">29 N.C. App.</cite> 468, 224 S.E.2d 686, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 551</cite>, 226 S.E.2d 509 (1976).

       <p>
        Mechanical Vending Devices.
   
   - While the legislature may not classify mechanical vending machines in accordance with the kinds of merchandise sold by such machines in levying privilege taxes on their use, since the manner in which the article is sold is the same in all instances and the economic advantages in this method of sale may be regarded as the same, it may classify mechanical vending devices for the purpose of taxation and make a further classification or subclassification in accordance with the quantity or kind of commodities sold by such method, when such classifications are based upon real and reasonable distinctions.

        Real Estate Brokers.
   
   - Public-Local Laws 1927, c. 241, requiring real estate brokers in certain designated counties to be licensed by a real estate commission on the basis of moral character and proficiency in the public interest, and requiring payment of a license fee in addition to the statewide license required, was unconstitutional, as it applied only to real estate brokers in the designated counties and was therefore discriminatory.

        Wholesale Grocers.
   
   - A special classification by statute of wholesale grocers operating a cold storage chamber of some character for the preservation of fresh meats, as distinguished from those who handled only canned meats not requiring refrigeration, was a reasonable classification imposing an equal burden upon all of the class, and was constitutional and valid. Southern Grain Provision Co. v. Maxwell, <cite class="nc_code">199 N.C. 661</cite>, 155 S.E. 557 (1930).

        Privilege Tax on Cyber-Gambling Establishments Was Constitutional.
   
   - City's privilege license tax on cyber-gambling establishments did not violate N.C. Const., Art. V,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   2(2) because the tax uniformly applied to all persons engaged in the cyber-gambling business. IMT, Inc. v. City of Lumberton, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 724 S.E.2d 588 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        City's privilege license tax on cyber-gambling establishments was not invalid because it exempted state-endorsed lotteries from taxation, as the state-endorsed lotteries provided net revenues to the state Education Lottery Fund and, thus, reasonably constituted a separate classification from unendorsed gambling. IMT, Inc. v. City of Lumberton, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. App.</cite> 36, 724 S.E.2d 588 (2012).

        Legislature May Not Grant Exemptions Beyond What Is Permitted in this Section.
   
   - The provisions of the revenue act exempting property from taxation must be considered in connection with this section, since the General Assembly has no power to exempt property from taxation beyond the permissive power granted it by this section. Sir Walter Lodge, No. 411 v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 632</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 365 (1940).

        Strict Construction of Exemptions.
   
   - Statutes enacted by the General Assembly exempting specific property from taxation, because of the purposes for which such property is held and used, are and should be construed strictly, when there is room for construction against exemption and in favor of taxation. Salisbury Hosp. v. Rowan County, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 8</cite>, 169 S.E. 805 (1933); Piedmont Mem. Hosp. v.

        Tax Exemption for State and Local Government Employees' Retirement Benefits.
   
   - The tax exemption for retirement benefits of state and local employees was a term or condition of retirement systems to which the employees had a contractual right and it did not constitute an unconstitutional contracting away of the state's sovereign power of taxation.

        Section Applies Only to Ad Valorem Taxes.
   
   - Any intent or attempt, on the part of the legislature, to grant an exemption from any tax or assessment on real property, pursuant to the provisions of this section, other than for ad valorem taxes, would be without constitutional authorization. Raleigh Cem. Ass'n v. City of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 509</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 506 (1952).

       </p>

        The constitutional limitations set forth in this section relate solely to the taxation of real and personal property, tangible and intangible, according to the value thereof, and are irrelevant in respect of the validity of a local sales and use tax act.

        Assessments on public school property for special benefits thereto, caused by improvement of the street on which it abuts, are not embraced within the prohibition of this section exempting property belonging to the State or to municipal corporations from taxation.

       <p>
        Former G.S. 160-521, exempting railroad right-of-way property from assessment for local improvements, was not unconstitutional on grounds that it was not authorized by this section, since this section deals with the power of taxation and not with assessments for local improvements.

   - Where, in construing a devise of various property in a city, the courts decreed that the lands should be sold within a period of five years and that 55% of the proceeds should be distributed among several beneficiaries of the class exempted by this section, the property itself was not held by the beneficiaries designated, but by the trustee in trust for the purpose of sale and distribution of part of the proceeds of the sale to them, and the exemption only applied to the proceeds of the sale when received by the beneficiaries in accordance with the decree, and the lands in the hands of the trustee were subject to taxation.

        Provision Exempting Public Property Is Self-Executing.
   
   - The provision of this section that property belonging to or owned by the State or municipal corporations shall be exempt from taxation is self-executing and requires no legislation to make it effective. Salisbury Hosp. v. Rowan County, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 8</cite>, 169 S.E. 805 (1933). See also, Piedmont Mem. Hosp. v.

       <p>
        Applies Regardless of Purpose for Which Property Is Held.
   
   - Property owned by the State is exempt from ad valorem taxation by subsection (3) of this section solely by reason of State ownership. Thus, <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.105.html#t105sIIa12s105-278.1" target="_blank">G.S. 105-278.1</a></cite>, requiring property owned by the State to be held exclusively for a public purpose in order to be exempt from taxation, is unconstitutional. Therefore, the Towns of Chapel Hill and Carrboro and the County of Orange may not assess ad valorem taxes against any property owned by the Univ. of North Carolina, an agency of the State, regardless of the purpose for which the property is held. In re Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 563</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 472 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (3) of this section provides that property "belonging to the State, counties and municipal corporations shall be exempt from taxation." It places no requirement, other than ownership, upon property to entitle it to exemption. In re Univ. of N.C. <cite class="nc_code">300 N.C. 563</cite>, 268 S.E.2d 472 (1980).

        The case of Redevelopment Comm'n v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 585</cite>, 164 S.E.2d 476 (1968), was based on the premise that all of the Commission's property was held for public or governmental purposes; therefore, the opinion's review of prior cases interpreting the constitutional exemption for State and municipally owned property, and the court's conclusion that allowing the exemption only for property used for public or governmental purposes was correct, must be characterized as obiter dictum.

        When Exemption Attaches.
   
   - The quality of exemption attaches to property as soon as it is lawfully acquired and remains with such property so long as it is owned by the municipal corporation, without regard to the purpose for which it was acquired or was held.

        Corporation, to Be Exempt, Must Be Subordinate Branch of State or Local Government.
   
   - In order to come within the constitutional orbit of tax exemption, a corporation must be an instrumentality, an agent, a department, or an arm of the State in the sense of being at least a subordinate branch of the State government or of a local subdivision thereof and subject to governmental visitation and control, so that ordinarily the interests and franchises pertaining to the corporation are either the exclusive property of the government itself or are under the exclusive control of some agency or political subdivision thereof.

        Corporation Composed of Shareholders Is Not a Municipal Corporation.
   
   - A municipal corporation is one designed to create within a prescribed territory a local government of the people therein, as a part of that exercised by the State, with certain and defined restrictions, and this section, exempting municipal corporations from taxation, does not include within its meaning or intent a corporation composed of shareholders, which in its form and controlling features is a business enterprise upon which municipal powers have been incidentally conferred in promotion of its primary purpose.

        Provision as to Exemption of Property Used for Educational, etc., Purposes Is Not Self-Executing.
   
   - Under subsection (3) of this section, the legislature may exercise, to the full extent or in part, the power to exempt from taxation property held for educational, scientific, literary, charitable or religious purposes, or may decline to exempt such property at all. The constitutional provision being in the disjunction, the legislature may exempt the property up to a certain value and tax all above it, and may also tax property held for one of the purposes named and exempt that held for others. Congregation of United Brethren v. Commissioners of Forsyth County, <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. 489</cite>, 20 S.E. 626 (1894). See also, Salisbury Hosp. v. Rowan County, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 8</cite>, 169 S.E. 805 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision of this section that the General Assembly may exempt from taxation property held for educational, scientific, literary, charitable or religious purposes is a grant of power and is not self-executing, and the power of the legislature to prescribe such exemptions is limited by the terms of the grant. Piedmont Mem. Hosp. v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 673</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 265 (1940).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor Is Provision as to Property Used as Residence.
   
   - The third sentence of subsection (3) of this section is only permissive in terms and is not self-executing. The power of exemption, to the extent therein mentioned, is exercisable, in whole or in part, or not at all, as the General Assembly, in its wisdom, shall determine. Nash v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 301</cite>, 190 S.E. 475 (1937).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of Legislature to Grant Such Exemptions Is Limited.
   
   - The power of the legislature to exempt from taxation property not owned by the State or its political subdivisions is limited and restricted by the scope of the constitutional grant of the permissive power of exemption. County of Rockingham v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 342</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 618 (1941). See also, Trustees of Guilford College v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 347</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 622 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to grant exemptions under authority of the second sentence in subsection (3) of this section, which may be exercised in whole, or in part, or not at all, as the General Assembly shall elect, is limited to property held for one or more of the purposes therein designated. County of Rockingham v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 342</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 618 (1941). See also, Trustees of Guilford College v.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Use to Which Property Is Devoted Controls.
   
   - Under this section, it is the use to which the property is devoted and to the extent of the interest so dedicated which should control, rather than the title or other tenure by which it is held, and its provisions are broad and comprehensive enough to uphold the legislative exemption as to all property used exclusively for educational purposes. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Oxford Sem. Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 582</cite>, 76 S.E. 640 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power granted to the legislature to exempt property from taxation is limited by the language of this section to property held for educational, scientific, charitable or religious purposes, the purpose for which the property is held and not the character of the corporation or association holding the property being the basis for the grant of permissive power to exempt; and thus, the legislature has no power to exempt property held by a religious or charitable corporation or organization for business or commercial purposes. Sir Walter Lodge, No. 411 v. Swain, <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 632</cite>, 9 S.E.2d 365 (1940).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Weight of Fact That Institution Has Not Been Paying Taxes.
   
   - The fact that an educational incorporation had gone for a long period of time without paying taxes, unchallenged by both the legislative and executive department of the government, is deserving of great weight by the court in construing this section. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Oxford Sem. Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 582</cite>, 76 S.E. 640 (1912).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Distinction Between Public and Private Institutions.
   
   - The provisions of this section make no distinction between public and private educational corporations, or between institutions which are in part conducted for the personal profit of the owner and those which are run on a salary basis, using any profits which may arise in the extension of the work. State ex rel. Corp. Comm'n v. Oxford Sem. Constr. Co., <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 582</cite>, 76 S.E. 640 (1912).

        Church Lot.
   
   - A lot purchased by the trustee of a church for the purpose of erecting a new church and Sunday school thereon, which pending the accumulation of sufficient funds to build the new church, was used exclusively for open air Sunday school and church meetings, was property held for religious purposes within the meaning of this section, and the legislature had the power to exempt such property from taxation. Harrison v. Guilford County, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 718</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 269 (1940).
   <br />

        Business property owned by an educational institution and rented

        Property of North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.
   
   - Since <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.122A.html" target="_blank">Chapter 122A</a></cite> and the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency's activities pursuant thereto are for a public purpose, it is permissible for the General Assembly to exempt from taxation the property of the Agency and the obligations incurred by the Agency to effectuate such public purpose. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds.
   
   - A legislative provision exempting the property and bonds of a city from taxation is valid when the bonds are to be issued for a public purpose, and certainly the bonds are exempt from taxation if sold to and held by an agency of the United States government, or are held by a purchaser from such federal agency. Any doubt as to the validity of this provision under this section must be resolved in favor of its validity. Webb v. Port Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 663</cite>, 172 S.E. 377 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds issued by a municipality to provide schoolhouses and equipment were for a public purpose, and since the bonds, although the property of a private corporation, were issued for a necessary public purpose and purchased in reliance upon the statutory provision exempting them from taxation, they would stand upon the same footing as the school buildings erected with the proceeds of the bonds. County of Mecklenburg v. Piedmont Fire Ins. Co., <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 171</cite>, 185 S.E. 654 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the enumerated properties under this section do not expressly include bonds issued by the State or any State agency, whether revenue bonds or full faith and credit bonds, it is nevertheless generally considered that the legislature of a state has the power to exempt state and municipal bonds from taxation, since if such bonds are exempt from taxation the state or municipality will be able to issue them on more favorable terms and may then save more money than it would lose by being deprived of the right to tax them. A legislature may exempt such securities from taxation, even if the Constitution enumerates the subjects of exemption, and does not specifically name government securities, and even in the face of a constitutional declaration forbidding passage of laws exempting any property. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of Session Laws 1967, c. 1177 (G.S. 116-209.1 et seq.) that exempt student loan revenue bonds from taxation by the State or by any of its subdivisions do not contravene this section. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the tax-exempt feature makes possible the more favorable sale of revenue bonds and thereby contributes substantially to the accomplishment of the public purpose for which they are issued, the General Assembly may exempt such bonds from taxation by the State or any of its subdivisions. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).

        Power to Contract Debts Limited.
   
   - The language of this section is unambiguous; by its plain terms, the power of the State to contract debts in any biennium without submitting the matter to a vote of the people, except for those purposes specifically enumerated in the section, is definitely prescribed to two-thirds of the amount by which its outstanding indebtedness was decreased during the prior biennium. Hallyburton v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 9</cite>, 195 S.E. 21 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution gives to the people the power to decide whether or not to contract a debt
   
   by requiring their duly elected representatives to submit the question to them for their approval before the indebtedness is assumed. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967); Cole v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 163 S.E.2d 628 (1968).

        Public Purpose for Taxation.
   
   - Town's breach of contract claim against landowners for proposing to close a hospital built on land the town granted failed because, inter alia, the landowners had held the land for more than the 30 year period during which a challenge to the landowners' title could be brought.

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Inapplicability to Turnpike Revenue Bonds.
   
   - Since the Turnpike Authority's revenue bonds do not create a debt within the meaning of the Constitution, the limitations of this section are inapplicable. North Carolina Tpk. Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., <cite class="nc_code">265 N.C. 109</cite>, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965).

       <p>
        Power to Enter into Long-Term Contracts Not Restricted.
   
   - The intent of the provision of this section which prohibits the General Assembly from contracting debt without voter approval is to restrict the State's power to borrow money, not its power to enter into long-term contracts. Boneno v. State, <cite class="nc_code">54 N.C. App.</cite> 690, 284 S.E.2d 170 (1981).

        Subsection (2) Does Not Apply to State's School System.
   
   - Subsection (2) of this section is an inhibition on giving or lending the credit of the State to third persons, individual or corporate, and of the kind contemplated in the provision; it cannot be construed to affect the mandatory provisions of N.C. Const., Art. IX, as to the maintenance of a statewide school system by legislative enactment. Lacy v. Fidelity Bank, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 373</cite>, 111 S.E. 612 (1922).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        No Prohibition on Insuring of School Property.
   
   - A county board of education has the authority to insure school property in a mutual fire insurance company authorized to do business in this State, and to assume the contingent liability limited to the amount of the cash premium, and the execution of such policy does not lend the credit of the State to a private corporation under this section. Fuller v. Lockhart, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 61</cite>, 182 S.E. 733 (1935).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority to Establish Reserve or Contingency Fund Not Pledge of Faith and Credit.
   
   - The fact that such appropriations as the General Assembly may see fit to make may be used for the establishment of a reserve or contingency fund to be available for the payment of the principal of and the interest on any bonds or notes of a public corporation does not constitute a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any political subdivision thereof for the payment of the principal of and the interest on any bonds or notes of the corporation. Martin v. North Carolina Hous. Corp., <cite class="nc_code">277 N.C. 29</cite>, 175 S.E.2d 665 (1970).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        When Issuance of Bonds Does Not Constitute Lending or Giving of State Credit.
   
   - Where an act specifically provides that bonds or notes issued under it shall not be deemed to constitute a debt, liability or obligation of the State or of any political subdivision thereof, or a pledge of the faith and credit of the State or of any such political subdivision, but that they "shall be payable solely from the revenues and other funds provided therefor," the issuance of such bonds does not constitute a giving or lending of the credit of the State, or of its agency, within the meaning of this section. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Issuance of Bonds to Finance Hospital.
   
   - Former G.S. 131-138 et seq., authorizing the Medical Care Commission (now Department of Human Resources) to issue revenue bonds to finance the construction of hospital facilities to be leased and ultimately conveyed to a public or private nonprofit agency, did not authorize the contracting of a debt by the State, or its agency, or the lending of the faith and credit of the State, or its agency, in violation of this section. Foster v. North Carolina Medical Care Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">283 N.C. 110</cite>, 195 S.E.2d 517 (1973).
   <br />

       <p>
        Issuance of Bonds to Aid War Veterans.
   
   - A statute for the purpose of issuing bonds, passed by the legislature and approved by the vote of the people at an election duly had for the purpose, providing for an issuance and sale of State bonds for the purpose of lending the proceeds on mortgage to a certain amount of the value of the land to the veterans of the First World War to help them in providing homes for themselves, is the pledging of the credit of the State for a public purpose, and is a valid exercise of statutory authority. Hinton v. Lacy, <cite class="nc_code">193 N.C. 496</cite>, 137 S.E. 669 (1927).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Issuance of Bonds to Pay for Stock.
   
   - A subscription for stock in a corporation and issuing bonds to pay for such stock is a gift of the credit of the State, within the meaning of this section. Galloway v. Jenkins, <cite class="nc_code">63 N.C. 147</cite> (1869).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Lease of Facility by Ports Authority to Private Corporation.
   
   - Lease of a facility by the Ports Authority to a private corporation, under the terms of which lease the corporation would pay during a five year term all costs of operation of the facility and rentals sufficient to retire in full revenue bonds issued by the Port Authority, did not constitute a loan of the credit of the State or the agency. North Carolina State Ports Auth. v. First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co., <cite class="nc_code">242 N.C. 416</cite>, 88 S.E.2d 109 (1955).

       </p>
       <p>
        National Park Act.
   
   - The statute establishing the North Carolina National Park Commission (Laws 1927, c. 48), with the certain powers therein enumerated, is for the benefit of the public of the State and not that of some third person, and does not fall within the provisions of this section. Yarborough v. North Carolina Park Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 284</cite>, 145 S.E. 563 (1928).

         The amendment effective July 1, 1973 is designed to narrow this section's restriction
        </b>
        on the local government's contracting powers. The previously effective language was held to require submission to the voters of a wide variety of contract obligations. United States v. 30.60 Acres of Land, 535 F. Supp. 33 (E.D.N.C. 1981).

        <b>
         The amendment to this section effective July 1, 1973 specifically defined "debt"

        to mean the borrowing of money by the local government, thereby excluding most general contractual obligations from the requirement of submission to the voters. United States v. 30.60 Acres of Land, 535 F. Supp. 33 (E.D.N.C. 1981).

          The cases cited below were decided under this section as it stood before the revision of this Article by the amendment adopted Nov. 3, 1970, effective July 1, 1973, or under corresponding provisions of the Constitution of 1868.

        Effect of Subsection (2).
   
   - For case construing provisions from which subsection (2) of this section was derived as the dominant or controlling limitation upon the power of local units to contract debts or to issue bonds, see Coe v. Surry County, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 125</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 910 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        The limitation prescribed by provisions from which subsection (2) of this section was derived was in addition to other constitutional limitations relating to taxation prescribed by this section and N.C. Const., Art. V,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   6; thus, a county may not borrow money, even for a necessary expense, without submitting the question to a vote, when its outstanding indebtedness has not been reduced during the prior fiscal year, and a taxpayer is entitled to injunctive relief restraining the issuance of the proposed bonds. Hallyburton v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 9</cite>, 195 S.E. 21 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of provision from which subsection (2) of this section was derived was unambiguous; by its plain terms the power of any county or municipality to contract debts in any fiscal year, without submitting the matter to a vote of the people, except for those purposes specifically enumerated in the amendment, is definitely prescribed to two-thirds of the amount by which its outstanding indebtedness was decreased during the prior fiscal year. Hallyburton v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 9</cite>, 195 S.E. 21 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        As to intent and effect of provisions from which subsection (3) of this section was derived,
   
   see Brodnax v. Groom, <cite class="nc_code">64 N.C. 244</cite> (1870); Paine v. Caldwell, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 488</cite> (1871); Chester &amp; L.N.G.R.R. v. Commissioners of Caldwell County, <cite class="nc_code">72 N.C. 486</cite> (1875); Horton v. Redevelopment Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">259 N.C. 605</cite>, 131 S.E.2d 464 (1963).

        Necessary Expenses.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution gives the people the power to decide whether or not to contract a debt
   
   by requiring their duly elected representatives to submit the question to them for their approval before the indebtedness is assumed. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967); Cole v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 163 S.E.2d 628 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional provision imposing a limitation upon the power of the State, counties and municipalities to contract debts without a vote of the people does not deprive the county of any power to contract a debt. It merely declares who shall have the power of decision. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967); Cole v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 163 S.E.2d 628 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution proceeds upon the theory that if it is, indeed, wise to contract an indebtedness for an unnecessary county or city expense, the people of the county or city will recognize this when the facts are presented to them and will approve the assumption of the obligation; and if they do not approve it, it ought not to be undertaken at their expense even though the county or city commissioners, and the courts as well, deem it wise to do so. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967); Cole v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">2 N.C. App.</cite> 652, 163 S.E.2d 628 (1968).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "municipal corporation" should not be construed narrowly
   
   to include only cities, towns, counties and school districts, as the Constitution contemplates a broader construction of the term. In its broader sense, the term includes all public corporations exercising governmental functions within the constitutional limitations. Wells v.

        When Bonds Are Not a "Debt".
   
   - Bonds of a city, issued for the purpose of acquiring revenue-producing property and which expressly provide that only the revenues produced by such property shall be used for or subject to demand for payment of such bonds, are not a "debt" of the city.

        Year Debt Contracted.
   
   - A debt is contracted during the fiscal year following that in which the debt was reduced, even though the certificate of the secretary of the local government commission required by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.159.html#t159sIIIa03s159-18" target="_blank">G.S. 159-18</a></cite> was not executed within that time. Board of Educ. v. State Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">217 N.C. 90</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 833 (1940).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the amount of debt contracted in any fiscal year
   
   within the provision of subsection (2) of this section, limiting the power of a taxing unit to contract debts to two-thirds the amount by which the taxing unit's outstanding debt was decreased during the prior fiscal year, the total amount of bonds issued during the fiscal year, by the taxing unit, whether with or without the approval of its voters, should be included, except bonds issued by it to fund or refund a valid existing debt, to supply a casual deficit, to suppress riots or insurrections, or to repel invasions, and except tax anticipation notes issued in an amount not exceeding 50% of the taxes for the fiscal year. Hallyburton v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 9</cite>, 195 S.E. 21 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds in excess of two-thirds of amount by which taxing unit decreased its outstanding debt during prior fiscal year
   
   may be issued upon approval of a majority of those voting under subsection (2) of this section. Twining v. City of Wilmington, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 655</cite>, 200 S.E. 416 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a proposed bond issue is in excess of two-thirds of the amount by which the issuing county reduced its outstanding indebtedness during the prior fiscal year, the question must be submitted to a vote and the issuance must be approved by a majority of the voters who shall vote thereon, regardless of the purpose of the bonds, unless the purpose is within the specific exceptions enumerated in subsection (2) of this section. Sessions v. Columbus County, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 634</cite>, 200 S.E. 418 (1939).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds are outstanding within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section until actually paid and canceled
   
   or delivered to the county for cancellation. Coe v. Surry County, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 125</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 910 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where county bonds were payable at a certain banking institution on the first day of a county fiscal year, and before the close of the next preceding fiscal year the county made available funds for payment thereof, the bonds were outstanding at the close of the latter year within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section. Coe v. Surry County, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 125</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 910 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Refunding Bonds.
   
   - A municipal corporation does not contract a "debt" when under statutory authority it issues bonds to refund bonds which at the date of the issuance of the refunding bonds are valid and enforceable obligations of the corporation. Bolich v. City of Winston-Salem, <cite class="nc_code">202 N.C. 786</cite>, 164 S.E. 361 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a proposed county bond issue was to refund a valid existing debt of the county within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section, under the exception therein provided a vote was unnecessary, nor could the means for the repayment of the bonds be adversely affected by any constitutional change. Thompson v. Harnett County, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 214</cite>, 193 S.E. 158 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, during the prior fiscal year, defendant county began refunding operations, and during that year issued its refunding bonds, but did not retire the bonds refunded until the first day of the present fiscal year, and where plaintiff contended that since both the refunding bonds and the bonds refunded were outstanding during the prior fiscal year, that there had been an increase rather than a decrease in the county's outstanding indebtedness during the prior fiscal year, it was held that the failure of the county to complete its refunding operations during the prior fiscal year was immaterial, and that the refunding bonds should not be included in determining the amount by which the county had reduced its outstanding indebtedness during the prior fiscal year within the meaning of the constitutional limitation on an increase of debt by counties and municipalities. Royal v. Sampson County, <cite class="nc_code">214 N.C. 259</cite>, 199 S.E. 15 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds for Streets and Sewage.
   
   - A municipality may not issue bonds for street and sewage construction or extension without a vote when, during the fiscal year, such city has issued bonds with the approval of the voters in excess of the amount by which it had reduced its outstanding indebtedness during the prior fiscal year, the purpose of subsection (2) of this section being to limit the existing power of the governing authorities to issue bonds for necessary expenses so that the net indebtedness of the taxing unit should not be increased beyond the limits prescribed in the amendment, except with the approval of its voters. Gill v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 160</cite>, 195 S.E. 368 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Bonds for Municipal Power Plant.
   
   - A contract of a municipality to construct a municipal electric power plant and to issue its bonds to pay for same, with provision that principal and interest of the bonds should be paid exclusively from the profits from the plant without resort to funds raised by taxation, does not create a "debt" of the municipality within the meaning of subsection (2) of this section, which prohibits the contracting of a debt by a municipality in any fiscal year in excess of two-thirds of the amount by which its debt was decreased during the prior fiscal year. Williamson v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 96</cite>, 195 S.E. 90 (1938). See also, McGuinn v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 56</cite>, 13 S.E.2d 48 (1941).

       <p>
        In an election for the issuance of county bonds for a new school building,
   
   a necessary expense, a favorable vote of the majority of those voting is sufficient to validate the bond resolution and authorize the issuance and sale of the proposed bonds. Mason v. Moore County Bd., of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 626</cite>, 51 S.E.2d 6 (1948).

       <p>
        Authority to Issue Bonds Implies Authority to Levy Taxes for Payment of Bonds.
   
   - The exercise by a municipal corporation of the power to pledge its credit is an incipient step in the exercise of the power of taxation, and authority given to a municipality to issue bonds necessarily involves the power to levy taxes for the payment of interest on said bonds and the payment of said bonds at maturity. Wilson v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">238 N.C. 14</cite>, 76 S.E.2d 546 (1953).

        It does not apply where the funds to be applied are already on hand
   
   and the proposed expenditure will impose no further liability on the municipality, nor involve the imposition of further taxation upon it. Davis v. Iredell County, <cite class="nc_code">9 N.C. App.</cite> 381, 176 S.E.2d 361 (1970).

       <p>
        Expenditures Imposing No Further Liability.
   
   - Provision from which subsection (3) of this section was derived from had no application where the funds to be applied were already on hand and the proposed expenditure would impose no further liability on the municipality. Adams v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">189 N.C. 232</cite>, 126 S.E. 611 (1925).

        The acquisition of land from surplus funds is not beyond the power of a city

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The acquisition of land for a municipal airport from surplus funds was not beyond the power of the city
   
   and it in no way offended this section. Goswick v. City of Durham, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 687</cite>, 191 S.E. 728 (1937).

       <p>
        Where appropriations were made by two cities and county to airport authority out of funds not derived from ad volorem taxes,
   
   and the funds were free from other specified purpose or legal commitment, no question of credit in violation of this section was involved. Greensboro-High Point Airport Auth. v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 1</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 803 (1946).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement to Contribute Nontax Revenue for Airport.
   
   - Even though an agreement between a city and a county and the federal government might be construed to obligate the city and county to spend only nontax revenue for the maintenance and operation of an airport, county and city were without authority to incur such debt without the approval of the voters. Vance County v. Royster, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 53</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 790 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        A contract between a county and one of its municipalities to contribute funds for the construction and operation of an airport, without submitting the question to a vote, was invalid, even if the contribution of funds for the construction of the airport was made from nontax revenue, where the contract was indivisible and the pledging of future operating funds was unlimited, and, even if limited to nontax revenue, would be unconstitutional. Yokley v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 218</cite>, 136 S.E.2d 564 (1964).

        Where a city sells land used for recreation purposes
   
   and turns the proceeds of the sale over to its park and recreation commission, the action is not a pledging of its faith and credit. Hall v. Redd, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 622</cite>, 146 S.E. 583 (1929).

       </p>
       <p>
        Vote on Distinct Debts in One Ballot Box.
   
   - An issue of municipal bonds, when approved by the voters, under the authority of a statute passed according to the constitutional requirements, is not invalid because there were several distinct debts provided and voted for in one ballot box. Smith v. Town of Belhaven, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 156</cite>, 63 S.E. 610 (1909).

        Only a single proposition may be placed on the ballot

   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Submission of Question of Issuance of County Bonds and City Bonds.
   
   - In a bond election in a county and a city situate therein, the submission to the voters of the question of the issuance of county bonds in a stipulated sum and city bonds in a stipulated sum for the purpose of providing funds for erecting and equipping public libraries for the city and for the county, and the imposition of a tax within the city for the payment of the city bonds and a tax in the entire county, including the city, for the payment of the county, as a single question, is the submission of but a single proposition so related and united as to form a rounded whole and does not violate this section. Jamison v. City of Charlotte, <cite class="nc_code">239 N.C. 682</cite>, 80 S.E.2d 904 (1954).

       <p>
        Endorsement of Township Bonds by County.
   
   - Where townships are permitted to call an election for the purpose of voting upon the issuance of township bonds for the roads of the township, the proceeds to be turned over to the sole management and control of the township commissioners, with further provision that the county endorse the bonds upon being satisfied of the validity of the issuance, the endorsement by the county of the township bonds is a loan of the credit of the county, without benefit to the other townships, and contrary to this section. Commissioners of Bladen County v. Boring, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 105</cite>, 95 S.E. 43 (1918).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Act Not Limiting Amount of Bonds.
   
   - An exception to the constitutionality of an act submitting the question of a bond issue to the voters cannot be sustained on the ground that it does not limit the amount of the bonds that may be issued for the purposes therein authorized. Waters v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 719</cite>, 120 S.E. 450 (1923).

       <p>
        Function Assumed by Municipality Must be Public.
   
   - A municipal corporation cannot, even with express legislative sanction, embark on any private enterprise or assume any function which is not in a legal sense public. Brown v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 744</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 104 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        A municipal corporation cannot, even with express legislative sanction, engage in any private enterprise or assume any function which is not in a legal sense public in nature, the word "private" as used in opinions discussing the powers of a municipality being used to designate proprietary, as distinguished from governmental, functions.

        Expansion of City's Power Lines with Surplus Profits.
   
   - Where an incorporated city under authority of statute furnishes through its own transmission lines electricity for its citizens for hire within a circumscribed territory adjoining its limits, and the expenses incident thereto are paid out of its surplus profits, the proposition is not one that requires the approval of the voters. Holmes v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 740</cite>, 150 S.E. 624 (1929), appeal dismissed, 281 U.S. 700, 50 S. Ct. 353, 74 L. Ed. 1126 (1930).

       Statute Authorizing County to Impose Tax.
   
   - Where a statute authorizes a county to impose a tax for necessary expenses, it is a delegation of the power to be exercised by the county as an agency for the State for the convenience of local administration, and the statute is not void in failing to state the special object to which it is to be applied, nor is the tax itself invalid if this constitutional requirement has been observed by the county authority in the imposition of the special tax.

       Transfer of Funds from Bond Issue from One Project to Another.
   
   - While a municipality has a limited authority, under certain conditions, to transfer or allocate funds from one project to another included within the general purpose for which bonds are authorized, the transfer must be to a project included in the general purpose as stated in the bond resolution, and the funds may be diverted to the proposed purposes only in the event that the municipality finds in good faith that conditions have so changed since the bonds were authorized that proceeds therefrom are no longer needed for the original purpose.

       Immaterial or Temporary Changes in Use of Bond Proceeds.
   
   - While the law will not justify the use of the proceeds of a State or municipal bond issue for purposes other than those specified in the act authorizing the issue, it does not follow that immaterial or temporary changes consistent with the general purpose of the legislative act should be interpreted as unlawful diversions of public funds. Coggins v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">278 N.C. 428</cite>, 180 S.E.2d 149 (1971).

       Actuarially Unsound Diversion of Funds.
   
   - Actuarially unsound diversion of funds threatened the integrity and security of a state employees' Retirement System. By diverting the funds, the state officials' actions impaired the contractual right of state employees to a retirement system funded in an actuarially sound manner and violated the employees' rights under the contract clause. Stone v. State, <cite class="nc_code">191 N.C. App.</cite> 402, 664 S.E.2d 32 (2008), review denied, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">363 N.C. 381</cite>, 680 S.E.2d 712 (2009).

       Sum Erroneously Placed in Sinking Fund.
   
   - While sinking funds provided for the retirement of municipal bonds may not be diverted from that purpose to other municipal requirements by a city, a sum erroneously placed on the books of the city in a sinking fund by a clerk without authorization, which sum was actually derived from profits from the municipal electric plant, does not fall within the constitutional or statutory inhibitions, and the city may by ordinance correct the error of the clerk and use the funds for other lawful municipal purposes.

       Legislative Authority Required.
   
   - Subsection (1) of this section means that there must be legislative authority in order for money to be validly drawn from the treasury. In other words, the legislative power is supreme over the public purse. White v. Hill, <cite class="nc_code">125 N.C. 194</cite>, 34 S.E. 432 (1899), citing Garner v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 250</cite>, 29 S.E. 364 (1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       Moneys paid into the hands of the State Treasurer by virtue of a State law become public funds for which the Treasurer is responsible, and may be disbursed only in accordance with legislative authority. Gardner v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 465</cite>, 38 S.E.2d 314 (1946); State v. Davis, <cite class="nc_code">270 N.C. 1</cite>, 153 S.E.2d 749, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 828, 88 S. Ct. 87, 19 L. Ed. 2d 84 (1967).

      <p>
       Subsection (1) as Bar to Judicial Action.
   
   - Subsection (1) of this section effectually bars any judicial action to enforce collection of liabilities against the State, and the courts cannot direct the State Treasurer to pay such claims, however just and unquestioned, when there is no legislative appropriation to pay the same. Garner v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 250</cite>, 29 S.E. 364 (1898).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       When Mandamus Will Lie.
   
   - It is only when the legislative department has appropriated a certain fund to the payment of a liability incurred or to be incurred and the Auditor or Treasurer refuses to obey the legislative mandate that the court can issue its mandamus to compel him to do so. Garner v. Worth, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 250</cite>, 29 S.E. 364 (1898).

      </p>
      <p>
       The State Treasurer may refuse to pay a warrant of the Auditor
   
   if it appears that the law under which it is issued is unconstitutional or the claim is not within the terms of the statute under which it is brought. Martin v. Clark, <cite class="nc_code">135 N.C. 178</cite>, 47 S.E. 397 (1904).

        Receipt of Funds by General Assembly from State or Agencies.
       </b>
       - The validity of any statute which provides that funds accruing to the State or any of its agencies "shall be received by the General Assembly" is questioned. Although the Constitution gives the General Assembly broad power to raise revenue and make appropriations, nothing in the Constitution authorizes the legislative branch actually to receive funds. In re Powers, 295 S.E.2d 589 (N.C. 1982).
      </p>

       North Carolina Department of Transportation's (NCDOT) appeal of an interlocutory procedural order in an inverse condemnation action was dismissed because NCDOT showed no deprivation of a substantial right, as (1) the case had progressed past the point where sovereign immunity could be asserted, (2) sovereign immunity did not bar suit when the state exercised the state's eminent domain power, (3) NCDOT was judicially estopped from denying prior admissions to recording a map placing restrictions on property owners' land, and (4) separation of powers did not bar ordering NCDOT's deposits for estimated compensation.

      <p>
       Appropriation of Federal Block Grant Funds.
   
   - Governor's claim challenging the General Assembly's appropriation of federal block grant funds awarded to the State was properly dismissed as the block grant funds were, despite their source in the federal government, subject to appropriation by the General Assembly because Congress left the issue of state legislative appropriation of federal block grants for each state to determine; and, while some federal funds could be considered custodial agency funds, the State Budget Act treated federal block grants as state funds subject to appropriation through the statutory budgetary process, and the Governor did not identify any federal prohibition against treating the block grant funds as state funds subject to legislative appropriation.

      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Constitution, the General Assembly may enact general laws to authorize the State, counties, cities or towns, and other State and local governmental entities to issue revenue bonds to finance or refinance for any such governmental entity or any nonprofit private corporation, regardless of any church or religious relationship, the cost of acquiring, constructing, and financing health care facility projects to be operated to serve and benefit the public; provided, no cost incurred earlier than two years prior to the effective date of this section shall be refinanced. Such bonds shall be payable from the revenues, gross or net, of any such projects and any other health care facilities of any such governmental entity or nonprofit private corporation pledged therefor; shall not be secured by a pledge of the full faith and credit, or deemed to create an indebtedness requiring voter approval of any governmental entity; and may be secured by an agreement which may provide for the conveyance of title of, with or without consideration, any such project or facilities to the governmental entity or nonprofit private corporation. The power of eminent domain shall not be used pursuant hereto for nonprofit private corporations.

      In addition to other powers conferred upon them by law, municipalities owning or operating facilities for the generation, transmission or distribution of electric power and energy and joint agencies formed by such municipalities for the purpose of owning or operating facilities for the generation and transmission of electric power and energy (each, respectively, "a unit of municipal government") may jointly or severally own, operate and maintain works, plants and facilities, within or without the State, for the generation and transmission of electric power and energy, or both, with any person, firm, association or corporation, public or private, engaged in the generation, transmission or distribution of electric power and energy for resale (each, respectively, "a co-owner") within this State or any state contiguous to this State, and may enter into and carry out agreements with respect to such jointly owned facilities. For the purpose of financing its share of the cost of any such jointly owned electric generation or transmission facilities, a unit of municipal government may issue its revenue bonds in the manner prescribed by the General Assembly, payable as to both principal and interest solely from and secured by a lien and charge on all or any part of the revenue derived, or to be derived, by such unit of municipal government from the ownership and operation of its electric facilities; provided, however, that no unit of municipal government shall be liable, either jointly or severally, for any acts, omissions or obligations of any co-owner, nor shall any money or property of any unit of municipal government be credited or otherwise applied to the account of any co-owner or be charged with any debt, lien or mortgage as a result of any debt or obligation of any co-owner.

     <p>
      Notwithstanding Section 4 of this Article, the General Assembly may enact general laws authorizing any county, city, or town to define territorial areas in the county, city, or town and borrow money to be used to finance public improvements associated with private development projects within the territorial areas, as provided in this section. The General Assembly shall set forth by statute the method for determining the size of the territorial area and the issuing unit. This method is conclusive. When a territorial area is defined pursuant to this section, the county shall determine the current assessed value of taxable real and personal property in the territorial area. Thereafter, property in the territorial area continues to be subject to taxation to the same extent and in like manner as property not in the territorial area, but the net proceeds of taxes levied on the excess, if any, of the assessed value of taxable real and personal property in the territorial area at the time the taxes are levied over the assessed value of taxable real and personal property in the territorial area at the time the territorial area was defined may be set aside. The instruments of indebtedness authorized by this section shall be secured by these set-aside proceeds. The General Assembly may authorize a county, city, or town issuing these instruments of indebtedness to pledge, as additional security, revenues available to the issuing unit from sources other than the issuing unit's exercise of its taxing power. As long as no revenues are pledged other than the set-aside proceeds authorized by this section and the revenues authorized in the preceding sentence, these instruments of indebtedness may be issued without approval by referendum. The county, city, or town may not pledge as security for these instruments of indebtedness any property tax revenues other than the set-aside proceeds authorized in this section, or in any other manner pledge its full faith and credit as security for these instruments of indebtedness unless a vote of the people is held as required by and in compliance with the requirements of Section 4 of this Article.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2 of this Article, the General Assembly may enact general laws authorizing a county, city, or town that has defined a territorial area pursuant to this section to assess property within the territorial area at a minimum value if agreed to by the owner of the property, which agreed minimum value shall be binding on the current owner and any future owners as long as the defined territorial area is in effect.

        One-Year Residency Requirement Invalid As Applied to Local Elections.
       </b>
       - The one-year durational residency requirement, as it relates to the right to vote in local elections, is unconstitutional and invalid, as violative of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Const., Amend. XIV. Andrews v. Cody, 327 F. Supp. 793 (M.D.N.C. 1971), aff'd, 405 U.S. 1034, 92 S. Ct. 1306, 31 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1972).

       <b>
        2, Expressly Allows Exclusion of Felons.
       </b>
       - A State may constitutionally continue the "historic exclusion" of felons from the franchise without regard to whether such exclusion can pass muster under the equal protection clause, because U.S. Const., Amend. XIV,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       2, expressly allows the exclusion of felons from the franchise without reduction of representation. Fincher v. Scott, 352 F. Supp. 117 (M.D.N.C. 1972), aff'd, 411 U.S. 961, 93 S. Ct. 2151, 36 L. Ed. 2d 681 (1973).
      </p>
      <p>
       Provisions in State statutes and constitutions which deny convicted felons the right to vote and hold office do not violate the various rights guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States. Wilson v. Goodwyn, 522 F. Supp. 1214 (E.D.N.C. 1981).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Residence" Defined.
   
   - Residence, as used in this section, is synonymous with domicile, denoting a permanent dwelling place to which the party, when absent, intends to return. State ex rel. Hannon v. Grizzard, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 115</cite> (1883); State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 705</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 12, petition for rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 797</cite>, 48 S.E.2d 37 (1948); Baker v. Varser, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 260</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 90 (1954).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Residence," within the purview of this provision, is synonymous with domicile, and as used in the North Carolina Constitution of 1970 continues to mean domicile. Hall v. Wake County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 600</cite>, 187 S.E.2d 52 (1972).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Duration of Residence.
   
   - A person, in order to become a qualified elector in this State, must have come into the State a year before the election, or have been domiciled within it for 12 months after forming the purpose to remain, and the same intent must be concurrent with the actual occupation of a domicile in the county in order to entitle him to the rights of an elector within its limits. People ex rel. Boyer v. Teague, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 576</cite>, 11 S.E. 665 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Residence Must Be of Permanent Character.
   
   - In order to acquire a residence for the purpose of exercising the right to vote in a given locality, the "residence" must be of a permanent and not of a temporary character, corresponding with the word domicile. State ex rel. Gower v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 697</cite>, 143 S.E. 513 (1928).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly Cannot Increase Length of Residence Requirement.
   
   - The General Assembly cannot in any way change the qualifications of voters in State, county, township, city or town elections; thus, an act which requires a longer residence in the county than this section requires is unconstitutional. People ex rel. Van Bokkelen v. Canaday, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 198</cite> (1875).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Qualifications for Municipal Election.
   
   - Cities and towns, like counties and townships, are parts and parcels of the State, organized for the convenience of local self-government; and the qualifications of voters are the same. People ex rel. Van Bokkelen v. Canaday, <cite class="nc_code">73 N.C. 198</cite> (1875).
      </p>
      <p>
       The qualifications of voters in a municipal election are the same as in a general one. State ex rel. Gower v. Carter, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 293</cite>, 139 S.E. 604 (1927).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Limitations on Voting Imposed by Municipality.
   
   - A provision in the charter of a municipality limiting the right of suffrage in municipal elections to owners of real property within the town is unconstitutional. Smith v. Town of Carolina Beach, <cite class="nc_code">206 N.C. 834</cite>, 175 S.E. 313 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       A provision in a town charter permitting nonresident freeholders to vote in all municipal elections is void because in conflict with this section. However, an election held under this provision is not void if it is shown that no persons not qualified under the Constitution actually participated in the election. Wrenn v. Town of Kure Beach, <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 292</cite>, 69 S.E.2d 492 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This constitutional provision applies primarily to an incoming person,
   
   who is not permitted to exercise political rights until after he has been in the State and the voting precinct for the prescribed periods. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 705</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 12, petition for rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 797</cite>, 48 S.E.2d 37 (1948).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No Application to a Citizen of this State Who Is Temporarily Absent.
   
   - This constitutional provision is not designed to disfranchise a citizen of the State when he leaves his home and goes into another state or into another county of this State for temporary purposes with the intention of retaining his home and of returning to it when the objects which call him away are attained. State ex rel. Owens v. Chaplin, <cite class="nc_code">228 N.C. 705</cite>, 47 S.E.2d 12, petition for rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">229 N.C. 797</cite>, 48 S.E.2d 37 (1948).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a voter was in the service of the federal government at Washington, D.C.,
   
   but continued to pay poll tax and vote in Halifax County, and spent a part of each year at his home in Halifax, his constitutional residence remained unchanged in Halifax. Baker v. Varser, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. 260</cite>, 82 S.E.2d 90 (1954).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Protracted Residence Abroad.
   
   - A protracted residence abroad of one engaged in business and with no home in this State is not consistent with the idea of residence here. State ex rel. Hannon v. Grizzard, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 115</cite> (1883).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Residence Near Precinct Line.
   
   - When a voter resides on or so near the precinct line, or where the line is so uncertain, that it is doubtful in which precinct the voter lives, and the voter, honestly and in good faith, bona fide registers and votes in the precinct he, in good faith, alleges and believes he lives in, and has good reason to believe he is correct, and registers and votes in no other precinct, such vote is legal. People ex rel. Boyer v. Teague, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 576</cite>, 11 S.E. 665 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure to Administer Oath to Electors.
   
   - The mere failure of the registrars (now chief judges) to administer the oath to the electors, and allowing them to vote where not challenged, will not affect the result of the election held for the establishment of a special road district under valid legislative authority, when the electors so voting are qualified. Woodall v. Western Wake Hwy. Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 377</cite>, 97 S.E. 226 (1918).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Vote by Convicted Criminal.
   
   - In a contested election case, conviction of an offense under a local law prescribing punishment in the State's prison renders void the vote of the one so convicted, whether the indictment charged or failed to charge that the alleged offense was "feloniously" committed. State ex rel. Robertson v. Jackson, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 695</cite>, 110 S.E. 593 (1922).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Vote of Escaped Prisoner.
   
   - If a person in jail for a misdemeanor (not infamous), and sentenced to imprisonment, escapes, and before he is recaptured his term or sentence expires, and he votes in his own precinct, in which he resided before he was sentenced, such vote is valid if the voter is otherwise qualified; but if the voter is a fugitive from justice, and is in hiding from one part of the county to another, and voted in the precinct he happened to be in, and not in the precinct of his residence when sentenced, such vote is illegal. People ex rel. Boyer v. Teague, <cite class="nc_code">106 N.C. 576</cite>, 11 S.E. 665 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>

        Photographic Identification.
       </b>
       - Legislative history supported voters' claim of an underlying motive of discriminatory intent in the enactment of Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824), entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote," because the voters presented some evidence suggesting the General Assembly refused to obtain updated data on the effects of S.B. 824's voter-ID provisions, instead relying on outdated data, and chose not to include certain types of ID disproportionately held by African Americans. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining Senate Bill 824, entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote," because the voters presented evidence showing the burdens of obtaining a free ID were significant and fell disproportionately on voters of color; the voter-ID provisions likely would have a negative impact on African Americans because they lack acceptable IDs at a greater rate than white voters. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) because absent an injunction, the voters have showed they were likely to suffer irreparable harm; S.B. 824's voter-ID requirements were likely to disproportionately impact African American voters to their detriment, and enjoining the voter-ID provisions furthered the public interest, which favored permitting as many qualified voters to vote as possible. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Voters showed the need for a statewide preliminary injunction barring legislators from implementing or enforcing the voter-ID provisions of Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) as to all North Carolina voters pending a ruling on the merits of the voters' facial challenge under the North Carolina Constitution because the alleged violation, the alleged facial unconstitutionality of S.B. 824, impacted the entire State of North Carolina. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction because they showed a likelihood of success on the merits in demonstrating discriminatory intent was a motivating factor behind enacting Senate Bill 824, entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote"; they sufficiently showed the act's historical background, the unusual sequence of events leading up to passage, legislative history, and evidence of disproportionate impact. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Voters made a sufficient preliminary showing that even if the General Assembly followed its rules, the process employed in enacting Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) was nevertheless unusual because sixty-one of the legislators who voted in favor of S.B. 824 had previously voted to enact a law thatwas struck down as motivated by a discriminatory intent; S.B. 824 was passed in a short timeframe by a lame-duck-Republican supermajority, which showed an intent to push through legislation. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.

       Registration is essential
   
   to the exercise by a citizen, possessed of the of the other legal qualifications, of his right to vote, and when duly made, is prima facie evidence of the right. State ex rel. Hampton v. Waldrop, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. 453</cite>, 10 S.E. 694 (1889).

        Photographic Identification.
       </b>
       - Legislative history supported voters' claim of an underlying motive of discriminatory intent in the enactment of Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824), entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote," because the voters presented some evidence suggesting the General Assembly refused to obtain updated data on the effects of S.B. 824's voter-ID provisions, instead relying on outdated data, and chose not to include certain types of ID disproportionately held by African Americans. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining Senate Bill 824, entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote," because the voters presented evidence showing the burdens of obtaining a free ID were significant and fell disproportionately on voters of color; the voter-ID provisions likely would have a negative impact on African Americans because they lack acceptable IDs at a greater rate than white voters. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction enjoining Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) because absent an injunction, the voters have showed they were likely to suffer irreparable harm; S.B. 824's voter-ID requirements were likely to disproportionately impact African American voters to their detriment, and enjoining the voter-ID provisions furthered the public interest, which favored permitting as many qualified voters to vote as possible. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Voters showed the need for a statewide preliminary injunction barring legislators from implementing or enforcing the voter-ID provisions of Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) as to all North Carolina voters pending a ruling on the merits of the voters' facial challenge under the North Carolina Constitution because the alleged violation, the alleged facial unconstitutionality of S.B. 824, impacted the entire State of North Carolina. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       It was error to deny voters' motion for preliminary injunction because they showed a likelihood of success on the merits in demonstrating discriminatory intent was a motivating factor behind enacting Senate Bill 824, entitled "An Act to Implement the Constitutional Amendment Requiring Photographic Identification to Vote"; they sufficiently showed the act's historical background, the unusual sequence of events leading up to passage, legislative history, and evidence of disproportionate impact. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.
   - , 840 S.E.2d 244 (2020).
      </p>
      <p>
       Voters made a sufficient preliminary showing that even if the General Assembly followed its rules, the process employed in enacting Senate Bill 824 (S.B. 824) was nevertheless unusual because sixty-one of the legislators who voted in favor of S.B. 824 had previously voted to enact a law thatwas struck down as motivated by a discriminatory intent; S.B. 824 was passed in a short timeframe by a lame-duck-Republican supermajority, which showed an intent to push through legislation. Holmes v. Moore, - N.C. App.

      </b>
      . - The United States Supreme Court upheld N.C. Const., art. VI, s. 4 on its face under the previous iteration of the N.C. Constitution ratified in 1868. The
      <i>
       Lassiter
      </i>

       Lassiter
      </i>
      , 360 U.S. at 51 (internal citation omitted). Ultimately, the Supreme Court held that the literacy test present in the 1868 N.C. Constitution was valid as "literacy and illiteracy are neutral on race, creed, color, and sex[.]"

       Validity of Literacy Requirement.
   
   - The provision of a former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.163.html#t163a03s163-28" target="_blank">G.S. 163-28</a></cite> which required all persons applying for registration to be able to read and write any section of the Constitution as an educational qualification to the right to vote was held authorized by this Article, and, since it applied alike to all persons who presented themselves for registration to vote, it made no discrimination based on race, creed or color, and therefore did not conflict with U.S. Const., Amends. XIV, XV, or XVII. Lassiter v. Northampton County Bd. of Elections, <cite class="nc_code">248 N.C. 102</cite>, 102 S.E.2d 853 (1958), aff'd, 360 U.S. 45, 79 S. Ct. 985, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (1959).
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of the literacy test as a prerequisite to registering to vote has the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color where it places an onerous burden on the black citizens for whom a county has maintained separate and inferior schools.

       Provisional Ballots.
   
   - Ordinarily, applications to vote provisionally are viewed as public records which must be disclosed pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.132.html" target="_blank">Chapter 132</a></cite> of the North Carolina General Statutes, because these documents are separate from ballots and there are a sufficient quantity of provisional ballots so that no vote could be attributed to any particular provisional voter.
   However, when there is only one provisional voter, that voter has an overriding and personal right to a secret ballot under this section, and a County Board of Elections is prohibited from disclosing any information that would identify the provisional voter.
   See opinion of Attorney General to Mr. Stephen T. Gheen, Chairman Gaston County Board of Elections, 1997 N.C.A.G. 67 (11/6/97).

      . - The United State Supreme Court prohibited a "religious test" as a qualification for public office. The prohibition extends to the several States through the Fourteenth Amendment to protect an individual's rights under the First Amendment. The Court held that a declaration of belief in God as a qualification of office was a violation of the "establishment of religion" by the State.

       "Adjudged" Defined.
   
   - The word "adjudged" means "to decide or rule upon as a judge or with judicial or quasi-judicial powers." In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       "Guilty" Defined.
   
   - The word "guilty" connotes evil, intentional wrongdoing and refers to conscious and culpable acts; it does not necessarily mean or require criminal conviction or the finding of a jury. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The definitions of "adjudged" and "guilty" are broad enough to encompass an adjudication by the Supreme Court,
   
   pursuant to the provisions of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>, that a judge is guilty of willful misconduct in office. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal Conviction Unnecessary for Disqualification.
   
   - Substitution in this section of the term "adjudged guilty" for the term "convicted" permits the General Assembly to prescribe proceedings in addition to criminal trials in which an adjudication of guilt will result in disqualification from office. Pursuant to that authorization, the legislature enacted <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>, barring a judge from future judicial office when he has been removed by this court for willful misconduct in office. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Adjudication of "Willful Misconduct in Office" Equivalent to "Malpractice in Any Office" for Removal Purposes.
   
   - An adjudication of "willful misconduct in office" by the Supreme Court in a proceeding instituted by the Judicial Standards Commission in which the judge or justice involved has been accorded due process of law and his guilt established by "clear and convincing evidence" is equivalent to an adjudication of guilt of "malpractice in any office" as used in this section. Therefore, the legislature acted within its power when it made disqualification from judicial office a consequence of removal for willful misconduct under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007A.html#t7AsVIIa30s7A-376" target="_blank">G.S. 7A-376</a></cite>. In re Peoples, <cite class="nc_code">296 N.C. 109</cite>, 250 S.E.2d 890 (1978), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 929, 99 S. Ct. 2859, 61 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1979).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Disqualification Not Part of Judgment.
   
   - Disqualification from office and loss of the right of suffrage, imposed by this section upon persons convicted of infamous offenses, constitute no part of the judgment of the court, but are mere consequences of such judgment. State v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">82 N.C. 685</cite> (1880), decided under former Art. VI,

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Additional Disqualifications.
   
   - The wording of this section does not necessarily imply that additional disqualifications cannot be added by the General Assembly for those persons not elected by the people. Instead this section merely enumerates three disqualifications, one of which applies only to offices filled by election by the people. Baker v. Martin, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 331</cite>, 410 S.E.2d 887 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Removal of Prosecuting Attorney.
   
   - A prosecuting attorney is removable from office as a matter of law or legal inference upon findings of his willful misconduct or maladministration in office, supported by evidence. State ex rel. Hyatt v. Hamme, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 684</cite>, 104 S.E. 174 (1920), decided under former Art. VI,

       Purpose.
   
   - The manifest intent of this section is to prevent double office holding, that is, that offices and places of public trust should not accumulate in any single person, and the superadded words of "places of trust or profit" were put in to avoid evasion in giving too technical a meaning to the preceding words. Doyle v. Aldermen of Raleigh, <cite class="nc_code">89 N.C. 133</cite> (1883), approved in Groves v. Barden, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. 8</cite>, 84 S.E. 1042 (1915).

      <p>
       This section was never intended to discourage public officials from assuming military leadership

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       One Person May Not Hold Two Offices.
   
   - Under this section, which is intended and designed to prevent or inhibit double office holding, except in certain instances, it is not permissible for one person to hold two offices at the same time. In re Yelton, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 845</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 567 (1944); In re Advisory Opinion, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 772</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 217 (1946).

       Definition of Public Office.

       Where the office which a judge proposed to accept

      <p>
       Acceptance of Second Office Vacates First Office.
   
   - Where one holding an "office or place of profit" accepts another such office or position in contravention of this section, the first is vacated eo instanti, and any further acts done by him in connection with the first office are without color, and cannot be de facto. Whitehead v. Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 89</cite>, 80 S.E. 976 (1914).
      </p>
      <p>
       The acceptance of a second office by one holding a public office operates ipso facto to vacate the first. While the officer has a right to elect which he will retain, his election is deemed to have been made when he accepts and qualifies for the second. Thus, the acceptance of the second office is of itself a resignation of the first. State ex rel. Barnhill v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 493</cite>, 29 S.E. 720 (1898); Whitehead v. Pittman, <cite class="nc_code">165 N.C. 89</cite>, 80 S.E. 976 (1914).
      </p>

       The acceptance of a second office which is forbidden or incompatible with the office already held operates ipso facto to vacate the first. In re Yelton, <cite class="nc_code">223 N.C. 845</cite>, 28 S.E.2d 567 (1944); In re Advisory Opinion, <cite class="nc_code">226 N.C. 772</cite>, 39 S.E.2d 217 (1946).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a man accepts an office under the State, he vacates another held under the same sovereignty. State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 377</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 49 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Date of Acceptance Is Date of Vacancy.
   
   - Where a vacancy in a public office occurs by virtue of the constitutional provision against double office holding, such vacancy occurs as of the date of the acceptance of the second office, unaffected by the fact that the person accepting the second office continues to discharge the duties of the office in good faith, since ignorance of the law excuses no man. State ex rel. Atkins v. Fortner, <cite class="nc_code">236 N.C. 264</cite>, 72 S.E.2d 594 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless First Office Is a Federal Office.
   
   - The constitutional inhibition against double office holding is enforced in alternative ways, depending on whether the first office is a State or a federal office. Where one holding a first office under the State violates this section by accepting a second office under either the State or the United States without surrendering the first office, he automatically and instantly vacates the first office, and he does not thereafter act as either a de jure or a de facto officer in performing functions of the first office, because he has neither right nor color of right to it. Where one holding a first office under the United States violates the section by accepting a second office under the State without surrendering the first office, his attempt to qualify for the second office is absolutely void, and he does not act as either a de jure or a de facto officer in performing the functions of the second office, because he has neither right nor color of right to it. Edwards v. Board of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">235 N.C. 345</cite>, 70 S.E.2d 170 (1952).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where clerk of county recorder's court accepted the office of justice of the peace
   
   without surrendering the first office, he automatically and instantly vacated the first office, and he did not thereafter act as either a de jure or a de facto officer in performing functions of the first office, because he had neither right nor color of right to it. State v. Cook, <cite class="nc_code">273 N.C. 377</cite>, 160 S.E.2d 49 (1968).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The jurisdiction of a judge of a municipal recorder's court
   
   to impose sentence could not be successfully attacked on the ground that at the time the recorder was appointed as such he was mayor of the municipality and that he therefore held two offices in contravention of this section, since even if it was granted that the statute permitting a mayor to be appointed recorder conferred upon the mayor when chosen recorder other than ex officio duties, the acceptance of the office of recorder would vacate the office of mayor, but would not affect the office of recorder. In re Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 735</cite>, 194 S.E. 499 (1938).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       A statute providing that the incumbent of one public office should also fill another
   
   public office is unconstitutional as violating this section, and cannot be upheld as merely affording a choice between the offices so that the acceptance of the second office would ipso facto vacate the first, since incumbency in the first is essential to incumbency in the second. State ex rel. Brigman v. Baley, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 119</cite>, 195 S.E. 617 (1938).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Statute which creates no new office
   
   and appoints no additional officer, but merely attaches new duties to offices already existing, to be performed by the incumbents therein, does not violate this section. State ex rel. Brigman v. Baley, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 119</cite>, 195 S.E. 617 (1938).
      </p>
      <p>
       Public-Local Laws of 1931, c. 341, providing that the chairmen of certain county boards of Madison County should elect a tax manager for the county, merely imposed additional duties ex officio upon the said chairmen, and did not provide that any one of them should hold two public offices in violation of this section.

       Delegation of Duties of City Manager.
   
   - A statute which places the affairs of a municipal corporation in the hands of a city council and a city manager and provides that in the event of a vacancy in the office of city manager, by sickness or otherwise, the council may delegate the duties of this office to one of its members, to be performed ex officio as mere auxiliary duties, with such compensation as the council may determine, but with no salary as a member of the council, did not contravene this section.

       Commissioner's Appointment Void Upon Appointment of Successor.
   
   - Panel of commissioners was evenly split and no majority existed because when the opinion and award was filed, a commissioner who concurred in the opinion was not an officer de jure pursuant as the commissioner's term had ended and a successor had been appointed. Therefore, because the commissioner's appointment was void before the opinion and award were entered, and because the commissioner's concurrence in the opinion and award was not the act of a qualified officer - neither de jure nor de facto - the concurrence was a nullity.

       Counties, cities and towns are governmental agencies of the State,
   
   created by the legislature for administrative purposes, and the legislature retains control and supervision over both classes of municipal corporations, limited only by this section. Town of Saluda v. County of Polk, <cite class="nc_code">207 N.C. 180</cite>, 176 S.E. 298 (1934).
      </p>
      <p>
       Municipal corporations are instrumentalities of the State for the administration of local government. They are created by the General Assembly under the general authority conferred by this section. They have such powers as are expressly conferred by statute and those necessarily implied therefrom. Town of Grimesland v. City of Wash., <cite class="nc_code">234 N.C. 117</cite>, 66 S.E.2d 794 (1951).
      </p>
      <p>
       A municipal corporation, city or town, is an agency created by the State to assist in the civil government of a designated territory. Its charter is the legislative description of the power to be exercised. In re Indian Hills, <cite class="nc_code">280 N.C. 659</cite>, 186 S.E.2d 909 (1972).

      </p>
      <p>
       This section gives the General Assembly the authority to provide for the organization and government of counties, including the granting of such powers and duties to the counties as it deems advisable. As an agent of the State, a county has no inherent power, but may exercise only those powers prescribed by statute and those necessarily implied by law.

       Municipal Corporations Derive their Powers Almost Solely from Legislative Enactment.
   
   - Municipal corporations derive their powers almost solely from legislative enactment under this section, and are subject to statutory restrictions and regulations of their taxing power. Purser v. Ledbetter, <cite class="nc_code">227 N.C. 1</cite>, 40 S.E.2d 702 (1946).
   <br />

      <p>
       Power to Tax.
   
   - This section seems to give a general control to the legislature on the subject of municipal corporations, and the legislature may, under it, restrict the power of taxation by corporations as it may think proper, due regard being had to other parts of the Constitution. Pullen v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">68 N.C. 451</cite> (1873).
      </p>
      <p>
       A sovereign state, as one of its inherent attributes, has the power of taxation, which must be exercised by its legislative branch. The county is not a sovereign and hence does not have the inherent power to levy taxes. A county must derive its taxing power from the State Constitution or from the State's legislative enactments.

        Control of Finances.

       - The legislature has plenary power to control the finances of the municipal corporations which it creates, and to direct how their revenues shall be applied. Hence it can direct that revenues derived from municipal enterprises shall be applied on outstanding bonds as well as upon bonds to be issued thereafter. George v.

       Powers of Municipal Corporation.
   
   - A municipal corporation possesses, and may exercise, the following powers, and no others: (1) those granted in express words; (2) those necessarily or fairly implied; and (3) those essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation, not simply convenient, but indispensable.

       Court of appeals erred in affirming an order granting summary judgment in favor of a town because its water and sewer "impact fee" ordinances were invalid since the plain language of Public Enterprise Statutes failed to empower the town to impose impact fees for future services; because the legislature alone controlled the extension of municipal authority, the ordinances on their face exceeded the powers delegated to the town, thus overstepping its rightful authority.

   - The legislature may restrict or limit the power of incorporated towns or cities to tax or contract debts for purposes which fall within the class of necessary expenses, for they are but the State's instrumentalities for the administration of local government; and when this restriction is thus placed upon them, or it is required of them to submit the question of a bond issue to popular vote, and an issue of bonds is made without compliance therewith, the issue is invalid.

       The enlargement of municipal boundaries by the annexation of new territory, and the consequent extension of corporate jurisdiction, including that of levying taxes, are legitimate subjects of legislation. In the absence of constitutional restriction, the extent to which such legislation shall be enacted, both with respect to the terms and circumstances under which the annexation may be had, and the manner in which it may be made, rests entirely in the discretion of the legislature.

     <p>
      In each county a Sheriff shall be elected by the qualified voters thereof at the same time and places as members of the General Assembly are elected and shall hold his office for a period of four years, subject to removal for cause as provided by law. No person is eligible to serve as Sheriff if that person has been convicted of a felony against this State, the United States, or another state, whether or not that person has been restored to the rights of citizenship in the manner prescribed by law. Convicted of a felony includes the entry of a plea of guilty; a verdict or finding of guilt by a jury, judge, magistrate, or other adjudicating body, tribunal, or official, either civilian or military; or a plea of no contest, nolo contendere, or the equivalent.

   "All moneys, stocks, bonds, and other property belonging to a county school fund, and the clear proceeds of all penalties and forfeitures and of all fines collected in the several counties for any breach of the penal laws of the State, shall belong to and remain in the several counties, and shall be faithfully appropriated and used exclusively for maintaining free public schools.” was approved by a majority of the voters voting at the election held on November 2, 2004, and the results of the election were certified by the State Board of Elections.
   The amendment became effective January 1, 2005.

        Sheriffs Not Entitled to Eleventh Amendment Immunity.
       </b>
       - The Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution does not bar a suit against a sheriff in his official capacity because state law treats sheriffs as local officials. Harter v. Vernon, 101 F.3d 334 (4th Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 521 U.S. 1120, 117 S. Ct. 2511, 138 L. Ed. 2d 1014 (1997).
      </p>
      <p>
       In the injured party's suit against a sheriff and individual detention officers arising out of a five-day episode in the county detention center where she alleged that they ignored her requests for medical treatment, the trial court properly concluded that the office of North Carolina sheriff was a "person" under 42 U.S.C.S.

Boyd v. Robeson County, <cite class="nc_code">169 N.C. App.</cite> 460, 621 S.E.2d 1 (2005), cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">359 N.C. 629</cite>, 615 S.E.2d 866 (2005).

       Trial court properly denied summary judgment to a sheriff and two detention center officers with regard to a former inmate's suit asserting a violation of her state and federal constitutional rights with regard to allegedly having been denied medical treatment for appendicitis while incarcerated at a county detention center. The sheriff and the officers were "persons" amendable to suit under 42 U.S.C.S.

      <p>
       A sheriff occupies a constitutional public office,
   
   and takes office, not by contract, but by commission subject to the power of the legislature to fix fees and compensation for which the Constitution does not provide. Borders v. Cline, <cite class="nc_code">212 N.C. 472</cite>, 193 S.E. 826 (1937), decided under former Art. IV,

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriffs Are Local Officers.
   
   - In providing for the organization of local governments, the N.C. Constitution does not make sheriffs state rather than local officers; therefore, Industrial Commission did not have jurisdiction to hear claims of negligence against county sheriffs. Hull v. Oldham, <cite class="nc_code">104 N.C. App.</cite> 29, 407 S.E.2d 611, cert. denied, <cite class="nc_code">330 N.C. 441</cite>, 412 S.E.2d 72 (1991).

       <b>
        Deputy Sheriffs.
       </b>
       - While the office of sheriff is provided for by this section, the right of the sheriff to appoint deputies is a common-law right; deputies appointed by the sheriff are public officers, but their duties and authority relate only to ministerial duties imposed by law upon the sheriff, in the performance of which they act for the sheriff in his name and right. Gowens v. Alamance County, 3 S.E.2d 339 (1939), decided under former Art. IV,
       <span class="s1">

       24, Const. 1868, prior to amendment in 1962.
      </p>
      <p>
       In light of the distinct demarcation between county government and the office of the sheriff, a sheriff's office is not a program or department of a county, and a deputy sheriff or employee of a sheriff's office is not a county employee. Young v. Bailey, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 665</cite>, 781 S.E.2d 277 (2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where a sheriff filed a Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) motion as to a former deputy's state wrongful termination claim, the complaint made clear that the deputy's term of employment expired with the sheriff's term of office, and the sheriff's decision not to reappoint him did not amount to wrongful termination. Randleman v. Johnson, 162 F. Supp. 3d 482 (M.D.N.C., 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       Assistant jailer was created by statute for purposes of public official immunity
   
   since: (1) the sheriff, a position created by N.C. Const., Art. VII,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   2, is permitted by <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.162.html#t162a03s162-22" target="_blank">G.S. 162-22</a></cite> and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.162.html#t162a03s162-24" target="_blank">G.S. 162-24</a></cite> to employ others, including assistant jailers, to assist him in performing his official duties to operate the jail; (2) assistant jailers are charged with the care, custody and maintenance of prisoners. (3) detention officers such as jailers have been described in <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.017E.html#t17Ea01s17E-2" target="_blank">G.S. 17E-2</a></cite> as a person, who through the special trust and confidence of the sheriff, has been appointed as a detention officer by the sheriff; and (4) under G.S. 153-224(a), the jail cannot operate without custodial personnel to supervise and maintain the safe custody and control of the prisoners.

       Discharge of Sheriff's Employees Based Upon Political Matters.
   
   - Deputy sheriff was discharged based upon political conduct without violating free speech rights. Dismissal of another employee's claim for violation of the employee's rights to free speech was appropriate because the sheriff produced evidence that the employee was discharged for failure to comply with the sheriff's department rules and policies, and the employee failed to produce specific evidence that the employee's discharge was politically motivated.

       Purpose of Section.
   
   - The purpose and effect of this section is to enable the State to control, modify or repeal corporate powers, thus avoiding the effect of the doctrine announced in Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 518, 4 L. Ed. 629 (1819); Elizabeth City Water &amp; Power Co. v. City of Elizabeth City, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 278</cite>, 124 S.E. 611 (1924). See also, Atlantic &amp; N.C.R.R. v. Dortch, <cite class="nc_code">124 N.C. 663</cite>, 33 S.E. 1014 (1899).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Section.
   
   - Except for purposes of absolute repeal, which is retained throughout as essential to the proper exercise and enforcement of the police powers of government, and except, also, in the instances expressly designated, this section withdraws from the General Assembly any and all power by special enactments to create, extend, alter, or amend the charter of all private business corporations, and all quasi-public corporations, such as railroads, incorporated turnpike or toll roads, bridge companies, and the like, and also those corporations which while having at times and to some extent powers appertaining to government are in fact and in truth business corporations for the purpose principally of promoting private interest. Watts v. Lenoir &amp; Blowing Rock, Tpk. Co., <cite class="nc_code">181 N.C. 129</cite>, 106 S.E. 497 (1921).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Only "Special Acts" are Prohibited.
   
   - This section only prohibits the enactment of a special act, and an act which relates to all municipal corporations of a county, including cities, towns, townships, and school districts, is not a special act within its meaning and intent. Kornegay v. City of Goldsboro, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 441</cite>, 105 S.E. 187 (1920).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Prohibition of Special Acts Applies Only to Private Corporations.
   
   - The prohibition contained in this section refers only to private or business corporations, and does not refer to public or quasi-public corporations acting as governmental agencies. Mills v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">175 N.C. 215</cite>, 95 S.E. 481 (1918); Dickson v. Brewer, <cite class="nc_code">180 N.C. 403</cite>, 104 S.E. 887 (1920). See Webb v. Port Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 663</cite>, 172 S.E. 377 (1934); In re Annexation Ordinances, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 637</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 795 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The provisions of this section prohibiting the legislature from creating a corporation or extending, altering or amending its charter by special act has been held to apply only to private or business corporations; and where the legislature by special act amending the charter of a city authorizes it to purchase electricity and resell it to its inhabitants and those within a three-mile zone of the city, the power to sell to such individuals and corporations does not detract from the public service or destroy the public character of the municipality, and where the same power is given the city by general statute also, the exercise of the power thus conferred will not be enjoined. Holmes v. City of Fayetteville, <cite class="nc_code">197 N.C. 740</cite>, 150 S.E. 624 (1929), appeal dismissed, 281 U.S. 700, 50 S. Ct. 353, 74 L. Ed. 1126 (1930).

       Authority over Public Corporations.
   
   - This Article and N.C. Const., Art. VII give the legislature complete authority to create, control, and dissolve cities, towns, and other public corporations or governmental agencies. State ex rel. East Lenoir San. Dist. v. City of Lenoir, <cite class="nc_code">249 N.C. 96</cite>, 105 S.E.2d 411 (1958).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature May Create Corporation for Public Purpose.
   
   - The legislative power as to State and political and administrative subdivisions thereof is restrained only by the limitations imposed by the State Constitution and the Constitution of the United States, and there is no constitutional limitation on the power of the General Assembly to create a corporation for a public purpose. Brumley v. Baxter, <cite class="nc_code">225 N.C. 691</cite>, 36 S.E.2d 281, 162 A.L.R. 930 (1945).

      <p>
       Commission created as an agency of the State to provide port facilities
   
   for the commerce of the State in the public interest, and not for private gain, is a public corporation, and the legislature is not prohibited from creating such corporation by this section, nor is the act creating it a special act within the meaning of this section, and the commission may lawfully exercise all powers conferred upon it in order to perform its duties as prescribed by the act. Webb v. Port Comm'n, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 663</cite>, 172 S.E. 377 (1934).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right of Alteration a Part of Every Charter.
   
   - The provisions of this section, affecting the organization of corporations, and specifically providing that all such laws may be altered from time to time or repealed, enters into every charter taken out or corporation formed thereunder, and any such corporation may not complain when a statutory repeal or amendment has been made, on the ground that it works a hardship on it or impairs the value of its property, unless vested rights have been acquired by it which have been impaired or destroyed by the repealing or amendatory act complained of. State v. Cantwell, <cite class="nc_code">142 N.C. 604</cite>, 55 S.E. 820 (1906); Yadkin River Power Co. v. Whitney Co., <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 31</cite>, 63 S.E. 188 (1908), appeal dismissed, 214 U.S. 503, 29 S. Ct. 702, 53 L. Ed. 1061 (1909); Elizabeth City Water &amp; Power Co. v. City of Elizabeth City, <cite class="nc_code">188 N.C. 278</cite>, 124 S.E. 611 (1924).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Power to Extinguish Corporations.
   
   - The General Assembly may, at its discretion, abolish municipal as well as other corporations, because they are all alike creatures of its will, and exist only at its pleasure. Ward v. Elizabeth City, <cite class="nc_code">121 N.C. 1</cite>, 27 S.E. 993 (1897).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Effect of Dissolution.
   
   - Upon the dissolution or extinction of a corporation under this section for any cause, real property conveyed to it in fee does not revert to the original grantors or their heirs, and its personal property does not escheat to the State; and this is so whether or not the duration of the corporation was limited by its charter or general statute. Wilson v. Leary, <cite class="nc_code">120 N.C. 90</cite>, 26 S.E. 630 (1897), overruling Fox v. Horah, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. 358</cite> (1841).

       Where the legislature deprived board of township trustees of its existence
   
   as a municipal corporation, the right to sue and be sued were likewise extinguished, and hence it could not thereafter be a party to a suit. Wallace v. Board of Trustees, <cite class="nc_code">84 N.C. 164</cite> (1881).

       Provision for Education Is for a Public Purpose.
   
   - The education of residents of the State is a recognized object of State government. Hence, provision therefor is for a public purpose. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
      </p>
      <p>
       Appropriations made by the General Assembly for the Opportunity Scholarship Program are for a public purpose because the ultimate beneficiary of providing these children additional educational opportunities is our collective citizenry; the provision of monetary assistance to lower-income families so that their children have additional educational opportunities is well within the scope of permissible governmental action and is intimately related to the needs of our state's citizenry. Hart v. State, <cite class="nc_code">368 N.C. 122</cite>, 774 S.E.2d 281 (2015).

       Methods Are to Be Determined by General Assembly.
   
   - Subject to constitutional limitations, methods to facilitate and achieve the public purpose of providing for the education or training of residents of this State in institutions of higher education of post-secondary schools are for determination by the General Assembly.

        Public School System Established.
   
   - The Constitution establishes the public school system, and the General Assembly provides for it, by its own taxing power, and by the taxing power of the counties, and the State Board of Education, by the aid of school committees, manages it. It is to be a "system," it is to be "general," and it is to be "uniform." It is not to be subject to the caprices of localities, but every locality, yea, every child, is to have the same advantage and be subject to the same rules and regulations. Lane v. Stanly, <cite class="nc_code">65 N.C. 153</cite> (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section contemplates that the General Assembly shall provide a State system of public schools to the end that every child, without regard to the county in which such child resides, shall have an opportunity to attend a school in which standards set up by the State are maintained and wherein tuition shall be free of charge. Marshburn v. Brown, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 331</cite>, 186 S.E. 265 (1936); Constantian v. Anson County, <cite class="nc_code">244 N.C. 221</cite>, 93 S.E.2d 163 (1956).

   2(2) to be mandatory, as the provision was not intended to provide any party with relief or protect public or private rights or interests; indeed, the purpose of the provision is to promote efficiency, as it gives the General Assembly a mechanism to supplement the costs and financial administration of the education system that it is required to set up and maintain.

        Meaning of "Uniform".
   
   - The requirement of this section that the public school system shall be uniform by legislative authority relates to the uniformity of the "system," and not to the uniformity of the class or kind of the "schools"; thus qualifying the word "system," it is sufficiently complied with where, by statute or authorized regulation of the public school authorities, provision is made for establishment of schools of like kind throughout all sections of the State and available to all of the school population of the territories contributing to their support.

       <p>
        Intent.
   
   - By mandating equal opportunities for all students, the framers of the Constitution and the voters that adopted it were emphasizing that the days of "separate but equal" education in this State were over, and that the people of this State were committed to providing all students with equal access to full participation in public schools, regardless of race or other classification.

        Equal access to participation in the public school system is a fundamental right

        Alternative Education.

        The right to education provided in the state constitution is a right to a sound basic education.
   
   An education that does not serve the purpose of preparing students to participate and compete in the society in which they live and work is devoid of substance and is constitutionally inadequate.

        Sound Basic Education.
   
   - Article I, Section 15 and Article IX, Section 2 of the North Carolina Constitution combine to guarantee every child of this state an opportunity to receive a sound basic education in our public schools. Leandro v. State, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 468 S.E.2d 543 (1996), aff'd and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 336</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 249, 1997 N.C. LEXIS 486 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of our Constitution, a sound basic education will provide the student with at least: (1) sufficient ability to read, write, and speak English and a sufficient knowledge of fundamental math and physical science to enable the student to function in a complex and rapidly changing society; (2) sufficient fundamental knowledge of geography, history and basic economic and political systems to enable the student to make informed choices regarding personal issues or issues that affect the community, state, and nation; (3) sufficient academic and vocational skills to enable the student to successfully engage in post-secondary education or vocational training; (4) and sufficient academic and social skills to enable the student to compete on an equal basis with others in further formal education or gainful employment. Leandro v. State, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 468 S.E.2d 543 (1996), aff'd and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 336</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 249, 1997 N.C. LEXIS 486 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a trial of a dispute between county commissioners and a school board over the county commissioners' required school funding, it was error to instruct a jury that the North Carolina Constitution provided every child the right to a sound basic education because the Constitution required the provision of the opportunity for a sound basic education. Union County Bd. of Educ. v. Union County Bd. of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">240 N.C. App.</cite> 274, 771 S.E.2d 590 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that a county, as an agency of the State, hinders the opportunity for children to receive a sound basic education, it is the State's constitutional burden to take corrective action. Silver v. Halifax Cty. Bd. of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 855</cite>, 821 S.E.2d 755 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        State, not a board of county commissioners, is solely responsible for guarding and preserving the right of every child in North Carolina to receive a sound basic education pursuant to the North Carolina Constitution; acting together, N.C. Const. art. I,

   1 of this Article are mandatory and require that the legislature provide by taxation and otherwise for a general and uniform system of public education, free of charge, to all of the children of the State and for the continuance of the school term in the various districts for at least six months (now nine months) in each and every year. Lacy v. Fidelity Bank, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 373</cite>, 111 S.E. 612 (1922), aff'd, 264 U.S. 171, 44 S. Ct. 280, 60 L. Ed. 623 (1924). See also, Collie v.

       <p>
        It is the duty of the State to provide a general and uniform State system of public schools of at least six months (now nine months) in every year, wherein tuition shall be free of charge to all the children of the State. It is a necessary expense, and a vote of the people is not required to make effective these and other constitutional provisions in relation to the public school system of the State.

        Establishment of School System Is Province of Legislature.
   
   - It is the province of the General Assembly, and not of the State Board of Education, to establish a uniform system of public schools. Board of Educ. v.

        Who Is Constitutionally Obligated.
   
   - Trial court properly dismissed the claim brought by students and organizations that the county board of commissioners bore the constitutional obligation for providing all children in the county with a sound basic education where prior case law clearly established that the constitutional responsibility to provide a sound basic education rested on the State.

        Instructional Service and Facilities Within Constitutional Mandate.
   
   - The mandate of this Article carries with it not merely the bare necessity of instructional service, but all facilities reasonably necessary to accomplish this main purpose. Harris v.

       </p>
       <p>
        Sites, Buildings and Equipment Necessary.
   
   - Sites, buildings, and equipment acquired, constructed, and used by a school district were deemed reasonably essential and necessary for the conduct and operation of the required school term at the time the said sites, buildings, and equipment were acquired and constructed. Mebane Graded Sch. Dist. v. County of Alamance, <cite class="nc_code">211 N.C. 213</cite>, 189 S.E. 873 (1937).

        No Maximum Limitation on School Term.
   
   - This section, which requires a public school system of the State to have at least six-months (now nine-months) terms in each year, leaves it to the discretionary power of the legislature to fix terms in excess of that period. Frazier v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">194 N.C. 49</cite>, 138 S.E. 433 (1927).

       <p>
        The mandatory provision of this section to the effect that one or more public schools shall be maintained at least six months (now nine months) in every year, wherein tuition shall be free of charge to children of the State, is not a limitation as to the length of the school term; it is the minimum required by the Constitution.

        Contract for Current Affairs Video Not Unconstitutional.

        Programs Proposed by Board of Education.

        Counties May Act as Agents of State.
   
   - A county is an administrative unit of the State in our statewide public school system, and a statute requiring a county to maintain at least a six-months (now nine-months) school term in each of its school districts and to provide the necessary funds therefor by taxation or otherwise is valid.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution requires the General Assembly to provide for a general and uniform system of public instruction. In fulfilling this purpose, the General Assembly may act through the agency of the county. When the county acts as agent of the State in carrying out legislative enactments, its actions fall within the authority granted by this section. Benvenue Parent-Teacher Ass'n v.

        Substantially Equal Funding Not Required.
   
   - Although the State Constitution requires that access to a sound basic education be provided equally in every school district, the equal opportunities clause of Article IX, Section 2(1) does not require substantially equal funding or educational advantages in all school districts. Leandro v. State, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 468 S.E.2d 543 (1996), aff'd and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 336</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 249, 1997 N.C. LEXIS 486 (1997).

        The equal opportunities clause of Article IX, Section 2(1) does not require substantially equal funding or educational advantages in all school districts. Banks v. County of Buncombe, <cite class="nc_code">128 N.C. App.</cite> 214, 494 S.E.2d 791, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">348 N.C. 687</cite>, 500 S.E.2d 666 (1998).

       <p>
        Creation of Supplemental Funding Programs Allowed.
   
   - Because under subsection (1) of this Section the General Assembly has the duty of providing the children of every school district with access to a sound basic education, it has inherent power to do those things reasonably related such as creating a supplemental state funding program to provide additional funds to poor districts. Leandro v. State, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. App.</cite> 1, 468 S.E.2d 543 (1996), aff'd and rev'd in part, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 336</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 249, 1997 N.C. LEXIS 486 (1997).

        Constitution Does Not Prohibit Charging Financially Able Persons for Supplies and Materials.
   
   - Requirement of administrative boards of certain school districts that those pupils or their parents who are financially able to do so furnish supplies and materials for the personal use of such students does not violate the mandate of subsection (1) of this section. Nor is there any constitutional impediment to the charging of modest, reasonable fees by individual school boards to support the purchase of supplementary supplies and materials for use by or on behalf of students. Sneed v. Greensboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 609</cite>, 264 S.E.2d 106 (1980).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Fee waiver policy adopted by city board of education was unconstitutional
   
   where it failed to establish a mechanism by which the schools would affirmatively notify students and their parents of the availability of a waiver or reduction of the fee or by which the students or parents themselves might apply for a partial or complete exemption from the fee requirements, since the waiver policy did not fairly guarantee to low income and indigent students their right of equal access to the educational opportunities available at their schools and did not accord procedural due process to such students. Sneed v. Greensboro City Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">299 N.C. 609</cite>, 264 S.E.2d 106 (1980).

       <p>
        Exit Tuition Fee for Transfer.
   
   - County Board of Education could not require the payment of an exit tuition fee as a condition to approving the transfer of a county resident student to a school system in a different county, as the exit tuition fee is not provided for by the constitution and statutes of this State. Streeter v. Greene County Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">115 N.C. App.</cite> 452, 446 S.E.2d 107 (1994).

        Distribution of Funds.
   
   - All of the funds raised in the State for common school purposes should be distributed per capita among the beneficiaries and not be retained in the counties where they are raised. Board of Educ. v. State Bd. of Educ., <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 313</cite>, 19 S.E. 277 (1894); Board of School Comm'rs v.

        Action for declaratory and injunctive relief brought by minors who were, or would be in the future, enrolled in public schools in the county, and their parents or legal guardians, alleging that the present statutory system of financing public schools in this State resulted in inequities in educational programs and facilities between the public schools within that county, which had a relatively low tax base from which to draw funds, and those in other counties with relatively high tax bases, and that the operation of five separate school systems in that county prohibited effective use of facilities and staff and promoted inequitable use of state and local funds, thus depriving them of equal opportunity to a free public school education in violation of subsection (1) of this section, and N.C.

        Trial court erred in declaring unconstitutional the Opportunity Scholarship Program because the legislation did not create an alternate system of publicly funded private schools legislation but provided modest scholarships to lower-income students for use at nonpublic schools of their choice; the uniformity clause of the constitution applies exclusively to the public school system and does not prohibit the General Assembly from funding educational initiatives outside of that system.

       <p>
        In a trial of a dispute between county commissioners and a school board over the county commissioners' required school funding, the school board, in opening statement, wrongly stated the standard to be applied "is not that which is absolutely necessary; it's that which is legally necessary, and reasonable and useful for the purposes sought" because the correct standard required funding legally necessary to support a system of free public schools, as a broader standard infringed on the county commissioners' authority under N.C.

        Levy of County Tax to Supplement Teachers' Salaries.
   
   - In levying an additional tax for the purpose of supplementing teachers' salaries pursuant to former G.S. 115-80(a), the board of county commissioners acted as an agency of the State under a delegation of authority from the General Assembly to carry out the duty imposed upon it by this section to maintain a system of public schools, and there was no requirement that such levy be submitted to a vote of the people. Harris v. Board of Comm'rs, <cite class="nc_code">1 N.C. App.</cite> 258, 161 S.E.2d 213, aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">274 N.C. 343</cite>, 163 S.E.2d 387 (1968).

        Tax Levy for County School Capital Reserve Fund.
   
   - Former G.S. 115-80.1, authorizing the county board of commissioners to levy an ad valorem tax for a county school capital reserve fund to be used for the purpose of anticipating school capital outlays, was a valid exercise of legislative authority; the creation of such fund did not require a vote of the people.

        Bond Issue for Student Loans.
   
   - Where bond proceeds are to be used solely to make loans to meritorious North Carolinians of slender means and to thereby minimize the number of qualified persons whose education or training is interrupted or abandoned for lack of funds, the bond proceeds are for a public purpose. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is expected that a student loan will inure to the private benefit of the person who obtains it. It is equally true that the education provided throughout the entire school system is intended to inure to the benefit of the individual who obtains it. However, the fact that the individual obtains a private benefit cannot be considered sufficient ground to defeat the execution of the paramount public purpose of encouraging education. State Educ. Assistance Auth. v. Bank of Statesville, <cite class="nc_code">276 N.C. 576</cite>, 174 S.E.2d 551 (1970).

        Assumption of Indebtedness of School District.
   
   - When necessary to maintain the term of public schools required by the Constitution, it is within the legislative authority in establishing its statewide system to assume an indebtedness of a school district therefor, including the cost of necessary buildings, and direct that it be provided for by the respective counties as administrative units of the public school system of the State.

        A student's right to an education may be constitutionally denied when

       Authority of State Board of Education.
   
   - The 1942 amendment to the Constitution rebalanced the division of power between the State Board of Education and the General Assembly by limiting the Board's authority to be subject more broadly to enactments by the General Assembly; the General Assembly, by enacting the Administrative Procedure Act and creating the Rules Review Commission, acted within the scope of its constitutional authority to limit the Board's rulemaking authority by requiring approval of rules prior to enactment. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       General Assembly's delegation to the Rules Review Commission of the authority to review and approve State Board of Education rules does not contravene the Board's general rulemaking authority; the General Assembly has delegated review and approval authority to the Commission without violating the separation of powers clause by providing adequate guidance and limiting the Commission's review and approval power. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).
      </p>
      <p>
       Court of Appeals properly reversed and remanded the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the State Board of Education regarding procedures for the Board's proposed rules and regulations because the General Assembly was constitutionally authorized to delegate authority to the Rules Review Commission to review and approve the State Board of Education's proposed rules, the APA provided a comprehensive statutory scheme for procedures and due process for individuals affected by administrative rules and decisions, and the Board could challenge the Commission's exercise of its delineated duties by filing a declaratory judgment action. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54 (2018).

       State May Regulate Private Schools.
   
   - The State has the power and authority to establish minimum standards for, and to regulate in a reasonable manner, private schools giving instruction to children of compulsory school age. This is necessarily true because such schools affect the public school system. In this connection it has authority, among other things, to inspect, supervise, and examine such schools and their teachers and pupils, and to require that all children of proper age attend some school, that teachers be of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that certain studies plainly essential to good citizenship be taught, and that nothing be taught that is manifestly inimical to the public welfare. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 337</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 444 (1960), decided under former Art. IX,

      </p>
      <p>
       As Exercise of Police Power.
   
   - The constitutional authority of the State Board of Education to make regulations for and supervise and administer schools is confined to public schools and activities substantially affecting public schools and the public school system. It may have and exert only such authority in the supervision and control of private schools and their agents and representatives as is conferred by the General Assembly in the proper exercise of the police power of the State. State v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">253 N.C. 337</cite>, 117 S.E.2d 444 (1960), decided under former Art. IX,

       Must Not Be Arbitrary.
   
   - While the legislature, under the police power, may regulate education in many respects in private schools, the exercise of such power of regulation must not be arbitrary, and must be limited to the preservation of the public safety, the public health, or the public morals.

       Constitution of 1868 Authorized Regulations on Certification of Teachers.
   
   - Article IX,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   9, Const. 1868, was designed to make, and did make, the powers conferred upon the State Board of Education subject to limitation and revision by acts of the General Assembly. That Constitution, itself, conferred upon the State Board of Education the enumerated powers to regulate the salaries and qualifications of teachers and to make needful rules and regulations in relation to this and other aspects of the administration of the public school system. In the silence of the General Assembly, the authority of the State Board to promulgate and administer further regulations concerning the certification of teachers in the public schools was limited only by other provisions in the Constitution itself. Guthrie v. Taylor, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 703</cite>, 185 S.E.2d 193 (1971), cert. denied, 406 U.S. 920, 92 S. Ct. 1774, 32 L. Ed. 2d 119 (1972).

      </p>
      <p>
       Present Constitution Contains Similar Authorization for Teacher Certification.
   
   - Rules and regulations relating to the certification of teachers being needed for the effective supervision and administration of the public school system, there is no difference in substance between the powers of the State Board of Education authorizing regulations on this matter under Art. IX,
   <span class="s1">

       Rulemaking Authority of Board of Education.
   
   - General Assembly has by statute ensured the Rules Review Commission is unable to create and impose rules and has made clear the Commission does not have authority to review the substantive efficacy of rules proposed by the State Board of Education, and its authority to implement the review and approval process is subordinate to the General Assembly's authority to create the review and approval process; thus, the Commission's power is not in conflict with the Board's broad rulemaking authority.

       This section was designed in its entirety to secure two wise ends,
   
   namely: (1) to set apart the property and revenue specified therein for the support of the public school system; and (2) to prevent diversion of public school property and revenue from their intended use to other purposes.

       Trial Court Could Not Command State Officials to Pay Money from State Treasury.
   
   - Although the State of North Carolina violated a provision in the North Carolina Constitution when it moved money otherwise destined for county schools to a separate state fund to pay for county jail programs, a trial court could not command state officials to pay money from the State of North Carolina's treasury to satisfy the court judgment against the State, because the Separation of Powers Clause in the Constitution prevented the courts from stepping into the shoes of the other branches of government and assuming their constitutional duties. Richmond Cty. Bd. of Educ. v. Cowell, <cite class="nc_code">254 N.C. App.</cite> 422, 803 S.E.2d 27 (2017), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">370 N.C. 574</cite>, 809 S.E.2d 872, 2018 N.C.

      <p>
       The term "penal laws,"
   
   as used in the context of this section, means laws that impose a monetary payment for their violation. The payment is punitive rather than remedial in nature and is intended to penalize the wrongdoer rather than to compensate a particular party. Mussallam v. Mussallam, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 504</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 364, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 116</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 915 (1988).

      <p>
       When Prescribed as Punishment for Public Wrongs.
   
   - Where fines and penalties are prescribed as a punishment for a violation of public wrongs, i.e., crimes, and such penalties or fines are to be recovered by public authority, the disposition of such recovered fines or penalties comes within the constitutional provision under consideration, and they may not be turned away from the prescribed constitutional course. Shore v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 628</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 553 (1976).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section appropriates all fines for violation of the criminal laws of the State for establishing and maintaining free public schools in the several counties, whether the fines are for violation of town ordinances made misdemeanors by statute or other criminal statutes.

       Penalties and Forfeitures Given by Law to State.

       Municipal Clerk Not Entitled to Fees from Fines.
   
   - By provision of this section, the clear proceeds of fines collected by the clerk of a municipal court belong to the county school fund, and the clerk is not entitled to retain a percentage thereof as his fees, regardless of the provisions of public-local laws relating to his compensation. County Bd. of Educ. v. City of High Point, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 636</cite>, 197 S.E. 191 (1938).

      <p>
       Moneys Voluntarily Paid for Violation of City Ordinances Belong to School Fund.
   
   - Moneys voluntarily paid by motorists to a city upon citations for violations of a city overtime parking ordinance constitute a penalty or fine collected for breach of a state penal law and should be used exclusively for maintaining free public schools in the county pursuant to this section, since violation of a city ordinance is also a violation of <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-4" target="_blank">G.S. 14-4</a></cite> which makes the violation of a local ordinance a misdemeanor.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Two Funds for Public Schools.
   
   - The provisions of this section relating to the clear proceeds from penalties, forfeitures and fines identify two distinct funds for the public schools. These are (1) the clear proceeds of all penalties and forfeitures in all cases, regardless of their nature, so long as they accrue to the state, and (2) the clear proceeds of all fines collected for any breach of the criminal laws. Mussallam v. Mussallam, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 504</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 364, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 116</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 915 (1988).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section establishes two funds for public schools: (1) the clear proceeds of all penalties and forfeitures in all cases, regardless of their nature, so long as they accrue to the state; and (2) the clear proceeds of all fines collected for any breach of the criminal laws. United States v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ., 902 F.2d 267 (4th Cir. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       Bond Proceeds Held Payable to Board of Education.
   
   - In custody case in which wife sought to regain custody of child who had been removed outside the country, bond set by superior court judge was to ensure husband's appearance, as the punishment for his failure to so appear would be immediate forfeiture of the bond, and since the terms of the bond specifically made its proceeds payable to the State of North Carolina should it be forfeited, such bond was penal in nature and accrued to the Board of Education. Mussallam v. Mussallam, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 504</cite>, 364 S.E.2d 364, rehearing denied, <cite class="nc_code">321 N.C. 116</cite>, 367 S.E.2d 915 (1988).

       The 1985 amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsVIIa31s115C-437" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-437</a></cite>, defining "clear proceeds,"
   
   could only be effective as to monies collected because of traffic violations occurring on and after July 17, 1985. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Disposition of Parking Fines.
   
   - In the situation of parking fines, the costs of collection often surpass the amounts collected, the intent of the municipality in passing these ordinances being the regulation of traffic rather than the production of revenue. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       While it is important that the needs of school children be met, and met generously, it is also important that a municipality feel free to enact ordinances imposing small fines for overtime parking violations without being economically penalized, if indeed the municipality realizes no revenue from enforcement of these ordinances. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Although defining costs of collection is a legislative function, the North Carolina General Assembly has not seen fit to provide municipalities with a formula for determining "clear proceeds" of fines realized from traffic violations. Lacking guidance on the subject, the court would be compelled to resort to a less precise measure in order to allow municipalities to retain the costs of collecting overtime parking fines. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The money penalty collected by a city from a motorist who violates its ordinance prohibiting overtime parking constitutes a penalty or fine collected for the breach of a state penal law, even if the motorist has not been convicted of violating <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.014.html#t14s0Ia01s14-4" target="_blank">G.S. 14-4</a></cite>. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The "clear proceeds" of a forfeiture
   
   are defined as the amount of the forfeit less the cost of collection, meaning thereby the citations and process against the bondsman usually in the practice. Hightower v. Thompson, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 491</cite>, 57 S.E.2d 763 (1950).
      </p>
      <p>
       The term "clear proceeds," as used in this section, is synonymous with "net proceeds." Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       The words "clear proceeds" in this section have been construed to mean the total amount of the fine, penalty, or forfeiture, less only the cost of collection, which, for a bail bond, is the cost of citing and issuing process against the bondsman in the usual manner. In re Dunlap, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 152, 310 S.E.2d 415 (1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       The costs of collection of a fine will be deducted to determine clear proceeds. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989).
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasonable costs of collection constitutionally may be deducted from the gross proceeds of the fines collected by a city for overtime parking. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Applicable Forfeitures.
       </b>
       - This section applies only to forfeitures that result from a breach of North Carolina penal law and not to forfeitures initiated by a federal agency because of a violation of federal law. United States v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ., 902 F.2d 267 (4th Cir. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        A forfeiture initiated by federal authorities and arising from violations of federal law
       </b>
       is not controlled by this section. United States v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ., 902 F.2d 267 (4th Cir. 1990).
      </p>
      <p>
       RICO Forfeitures.
   
   - Since the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) provides that the proceeds from the sale of RICO forfeited property accrue to the State, such proceeds must therefore be paid to the public school fund pursuant to this section. State ex rel. Thornburg v. 532 "B" Street, <cite class="nc_code">334 N.C. 290</cite>, 432 S.E.2d 684 (1993).
   <br />

   - The plain language of this section limits its application to forfeitures resulting from a "breach of the penal laws of the State" and <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.090.html#t90a05s90-112" target="_blank">G.S. 90-112(d1)</a></cite> of the North Carolina Act refers only to forfeitures "pursuant to this section." United States v. Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Bd. of Educ., 902 F.2d 267 (4th Cir. 1990).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The test for determining permissible deductions from gross moneys taken in
   
   is that the item, to be deductible, must bear a reasonable relation to the costs of collection of the fine. A determination of costs can be made by qualified accountants, which determination is no more complicated than other problems accountants are daily accustomed to resolving. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">66 N.C. App.</cite> 537, 311 S.E.2d 889 (1984), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1989); Harrell v. Harriet &amp; Henderson Yarns, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 566</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 47 (1985), decided prior to 1985 amendment to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.115C.html#t115CsVIIa31s115C-437" target="_blank">G.S. 115C-437</a></cite> defining "clear proceeds."
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The costs of collection
   
   do not include the costs associated with enforcing the ordinance, but are limited to the administrative costs of collecting the funds. Cauble v. City of Asheville, <cite class="nc_code">314 N.C. 598</cite>, 336 S.E.2d 59 (1985).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Moneys to be set aside for future enforcement of the law cannot be deducted from "fines"
   
   to arrive at "clear proceeds" of fines. Shore v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 628</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 553 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Use of Penal Fines.
   
   - This section provides that the fines collected for any breach of the penal laws shall be used exclusively for the benefit of the public schools. Any judgment of a trial judge which seeks to direct payment of a fine anywhere other than to the counties for the use of the public schools is unconstitutional. Florence v. Hiatt, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 400 S.E.2d 118 (1991).
      </p>
      <p>

       Use of Assessments.
   
   - While the court concluded that the assessments made pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.160A.html#t160Aa15s160A-300.1" target="_blank">G.S. 160A-300.1</a></cite> and High Point, N.C. Ordinance No. 00-89,

   <span class="s1">
    §

   7, and therefore the school board's motion for summary judgment on the issue was denied. In denying the school board's motion, the court responded to its request for a declaratory ruling as to whether the fines and other amounts received by the city and the other defendants under the statute and the ordinance had to be paid to the school board; such assessments were not required to be appropriated and used exclusively for maintaining free public schools in the county.

       What County Is Entitled to Proceeds.

       Authority of State Board of Education.
   
   - By the 1942 amendment to the North Carolina Constitution, the framers and voters consolidated in the State Board of Education all administrative authority governing a statewide public school system, limited the Board's authority to making rules and regulations subject to laws enacted by the General Assembly, eliminated the Board's authority to legislate, and thereby restored to the General Assembly all legislative authority regarding public education.

      </p>
      <p>
       1942 amendment to the Constitution rebalanced the division of power between the State Board of Education and the General Assembly by limiting the Board's authority to be subject more broadly to enactments by the General Assembly; the General Assembly, by enacting the Administrative Procedure Act and creating the Rules Review Commission, acted within the scope of its constitutional authority to limit the Board's rulemaking authority by requiring approval of rules prior to enactment. N.C. State Bd. of Educ. v. State, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. App.</cite> 514, 805 S.E.2d 518 (2017), aff'd, <cite class="nc_code">371 N.C. 149</cite>, 814 S.E.2d 54, 2018 N.C. LEXIS 433 (2018).

       Authority of State Board of Education to Regulate Public Schools.
   
   - Competing provisions in the 1942 amendment can be harmonized by interpreting the first sentence to establish that the State Board of Education, and none of the other then-existing education boards and commissions created by the General Assembly in 1868, is authorized to regulate public schools; reciting that the Board succeeded to all the powers of the Literary Fund's board nullifies the authority of other boards and commissions to perform duties initially assigned to the Board.

   - Trial court erred in granting the North Carolina State Board of Education summary judgment in its action to prevent the North Carolina Rules Review Commission from exercising any authority over it and controlling its enactment of rules because the Board's rulemaking authority was subject to statutes providing for review and approval by the Commission; this holding fell within the 1942 North Carolina Constitutional amendment's delineation of the General Assembly's authority over the Board.

       Exemption Is a Constitutional Right.
   
   - The right to the personal property exemption exists not by virtue of the allotment, but by virtue of the Constitution, which confers it and attaches the protection to the debtor before the allotment or appraisal. Lockhart v. Bear, <cite class="nc_code">117 N.C. 298</cite>, 23 S.E. 484 (1895). See also, Crow v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 153</cite>, 185 S.E. 668 (1936).

       Law Protects Owner Only for Loss of Exempt Property Under Final Process.
   
   - The law protects the owner not from destitution, but only from loss of exempt property due to sale under final process for the collection of any debt. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).

       Debtor Entitled to Exemption at All Times.
   
   - The $500.00 personal property exemption prescribed by this section entitles a judgment debtor to the amount of the exemption at all times, and such sum may be set apart for the comfort and support of the judgment debtor as often as the judgment debtor may be pressed with execution. Commissioner of Banks ex rel. Goldsboro Sav. &amp; Trust Co. v. Yelverton, <cite class="nc_code">204 N.C. 441</cite>, 168 S.E. 505, commented on in 12 N.C.L. Rev. 65 (1934).

        Allotted From Time to Time.
       </b>
       - The $500.00 personal property exemption guaranteed by this section must be allotted from time to time as often as the judgment debtor might be pressed with execution, the policy being to enable him not only to have the exemptions allotted to him once, but to keep them about him all the time, for the comfort and support of himself and his family. New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 196 F. Supp. 780 (M.D.N.C. 1961), rev'd on other grounds, 301 F.2d 839 (4th Cir. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Retention of Funds by Debtor.
   
   - When any final process against the debtor's estate is to be enforced, that much of his estate must be allowed to remain with him as is not liable to sale. Gardner v. McConnaughey, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 481</cite>, 73 S.E. 125 (1911). See also, Campbell v. White, <cite class="nc_code">95 N.C. 344</cite> (1886).

       <b>
        Exempt Funds on Hand May Not Exceed Constitutional Amount.
       </b>
       - A judgment debtor may claim his exemption as against successive executions, but may not have exempt funds in his possession at any one time in excess of his exemption. Stated another way, a judgment debtor is privileged to make successive claims for his exemption, but may not hold free from execution at any one time an amount in excess of his exemption. New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 196 F. Supp. 780 (M.D.N.C. 1961), rev'd on other grounds, 301 F.2d 839 (4th Cir. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither this section nor <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001C.html#t1Ca16s1C-1601ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 1C-1601(a)</a></cite> confers any property exemptions on past residents of this State.
   
   Indeed, the constitutional and statutory provisions both contemplate the possibility that changes in the debtor's residency or other changing circumstances may warrant subsequent modification of the debtor's right to constitutional or statutory exemptions. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 367 S.E.2d 367 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Residency.
   
   - Irrespective of defendant's resident status previously, the trial court correctly determined defendant's residency based upon the evidence at the 1987 hearing. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 367 S.E.2d 367 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the only evidence supporting defendant's contention of residency was her statement that she "hoped" to return to this state
   
   as soon as her sister's estate in Ireland was settled, this general declaration did not of itself defeat the trial court's findings of nonresidency, in light of the other facts of the case, especially the undisputed evidence that defendant had moved to Ireland (her place of citizenship) at least one year previously, had no dwelling in this state, and offered no definite plan to return. First Union Nat'l Bank v. Rolfe, <cite class="nc_code">90 N.C. App.</cite> 85, 367 S.E.2d 367 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Time for Claiming Exemption.
   
   - It is only when property is about to be subjected to the payment of a debt by final process that the last opportunity is left to the defendant to claim his exemption. At any time before this stage of the proceeding is reached, he may make his demand and become entitled to an allotment of the exemption. Chemical Co. v. Sloan, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 122</cite>, 48 S.E. 577 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       The defendant may demand his exemption when a warrant of attachment is levied on his property and it is taken out of his possession, or he may wait until the final process is issued and the property is about to be appropriated by sale to the satisfaction of the same. Chemical Co. v. Sloan, <cite class="nc_code">136 N.C. 122</cite>, 48 S.E. 577 (1904).
      </p>
      <p>
       A debtor may legally demand his personal property exemption at any time and up to the last moment before the appropriation thereof by the court, and the order of court directing a payment of the money derived from the sale of such property is final process within the meaning of the Constitution, giving the creditor such right until execution or other final process. Befarrah v. Spell, <cite class="nc_code">178 N.C. 231</cite>, 100 S.E. 321 (1919); Crow v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 153</cite>, 185 S.E. 668 (1936).
      </p>
      <p>
       Until there has been a levy on personal property, no occasion for application of the constitutional exemption arises. New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 301 F.2d 839 (4th Cir. 1962).
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional exemption can be claimed only at the moment of levy. New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Waller, 323 F.2d 20 (4th Cir. 1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 963, 84 S. Ct. 1124, 11 L. Ed. 2d 981 (1964).
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor May Voluntarily Bargain Away Exemption Right.
   
   - In cases of foreclosure of mortgages or of taking possession of collateral after default, no right to possession of property otherwise exempt remains in the debtor, who has voluntarily bargained it away. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislature Has Not Prevented Debtor from Transferring Interest in Property to Another.
   
   - The legislature has seen fit to surround the family home with certain protections against the demands of urgent creditors to put it beyond the reach of those financial misfortunes which even the most prudent and sagacious cannot always avoid. It has not seen fit to prevent a debtor from "selling" or otherwise transferring an interest in that property to another, thereby giving the other priority of right to possession of the collateral. The constitutional exemption operates against general creditors so as to allow the debtor to retain his most valued $500.00 of property in the face of their executions. It does not operate so as to hinder secured creditors from realizing on the terms of their bargain. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Security Interest Has Replaced Chattel Mortgage as Protection of Creditor.
   
   - Before the enactment of the Uniform Commercial Code, a debtor could subject his personal property to a chattel mortgage, and if he did so, the property was liable for the mortgage debt first and the debtor's exemption was allotted only in the amount of the surplus. An Article 9 security interest by the terms of the Uniform Commercial Code replaces the chattel mortgage as a method of protecting the creditor. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Debtor divested herself of right to possession of personal property by terms of consumer loan contract
   
   with her creditor whereby the creditor obtained a security interest in all of her personal property, including her household furnishings. When the debtor defaulted, the creditor had an immediate right to possess all articles in which she had given a security interest. However, this right must be distinguished from any interest which a creditor might seek under an executory waiver of the right to exemption. It has long been held that a debtor cannot be bound by any agreement to waive his exemption in case of levy upon his property. Montford v. Grohman, <cite class="nc_code">36 N.C. App.</cite> 733, 245 S.E.2d 219, appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 551</cite>, 248 S.E.2d 727 (1978).

        Exemption May Not Frustrate Laws Relating to Fraudulent Conveyances.
       </b>

       Exemption Ceases at Death of Claimant.
   
   - The personal property exemption provided for by this section and the laws passed pursuant thereto exists only during the life of the homesteader, and after his death passes to his personal representative to be disposed of in due course of administration.

       Counterclaim and Setoff.
   
   - A party may not demand that his claim be allowed him as his personal property exemption so as to defeat the adverse party's right of counterclaim or setoff prior to rendition of the final judgment on his claim, since to permit the party to asset the exemption before judgment would enable him to obtain judgment in instances in which, if a balance were struck, nothing would be due him. Edgerton v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 300</cite>, 10 S.E.2d 918 (1940). For note on this case, see 19 N.C.L. Rev 227 (1941).

Edgerton v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">218 N.C. 300</cite>, 10 S.E.2d 918 (1940). For note on this case, see 19 N.C.L. Rev. 227 (1941).

        Homestead and Personal Property Exemptions Distinguished.
   
   - The homestead exemption is permanent unless there is a reallotment by reason of an increase in value. But the personal property exemption is to be reassigned whenever, at subsequent dates, executions are levied. The reason is that the realty is fixed and stable, whereas the articles of personal property may be increased or diminished in quantity between the levy of executions. Gardner v. McConnaughey, <cite class="nc_code">157 N.C. 481</cite>, 73 S.E. 125 (1911).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Power to Increase Value of Homestead Exemption.
   
   - The Constitution expressly vests in the General Assembly, not in the courts, the exclusive power to increase the value of the homestead exemption. Seeman Printery, Inc. v. Schinhan, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 239 S.E.2d 744 (1977), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 442</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Comparison of former section with present subsection (1) of this section reveals that the major difference is that under the former the homestead could not exceed $1000 in value, while under the present Constitution the homestead shall be to a value fixed by the General Assembly but not less than $1000. Seeman Printery, Inc. v. Schinhan, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 239 S.E.2d 744 (1977), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 442</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 844 (1978).

       <p>
        <b>
         Present Possessory Interest Necessary for Homestead Exemption Claim.
        </b>
        - In this State, a homestead exemption may not be claimed in property in which the claimant has no present possessory interest at the time the claim is made. In re Hudson, 4 Bankr. 337 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Ownership Interest Required.
        </b>
        - Under North Carolina law, an individual must have an ownership interest in residential property in order to claim a homestead exemption in the property. Hollar v. United States, 184 Bankr. 25 (Bankr. M.D.N.C.), aff'd, 188 Bankr. 539 (M.D.N.C. 1995), aff'd, 92 F.3d 1179 (4th Cir. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Extent of Exemption of Dwelling House.
   
   - The constitutional and statutory enactments relating to the homestead exemption cannot be so construed as to permit exemption of an entire usable dwelling house, regardless of its value. Seeman Printery, Inc. v. Schinham, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 239 S.E.2d 744 (1977), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 442</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of Allotment Useless to Debtor which Impairs Value of Remaining Property.
   
   - Where the debtor requested that the allotment of his homestead begin at a point at the front door of his dwelling, with the result that the entire area allotted was located in the hallway adjacent to the front door of the house, the fact that the allotment was useless to the debtor and impaired the value of the remaining property available for satisfaction of the creditor's judgment did not entitle the debtor to claim his exemption in the entire dwelling. Seeman Printery, Inc. v. Schinhan, <cite class="nc_code">34 N.C. App.</cite> 637, 239 S.E.2d 744 (1977), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">294 N.C. 442</cite>, 241 S.E.2d 844 (1978).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Residence of Debtor.
   
   - For case in which evidence was insufficient to support finding by the court that judgment debtor was resident and entitled to homestead, see S.D. Scott &amp; Co. v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 74</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 219 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Duration of Homestead.
   
   - The homestead as allowed lasts during the life of the owner thereof; and, after his death, it lasts during the minority of his children, or any one of them, and the widowhood of his widow (now spouse), unless she be the owner of a homestead in her own right. Williams v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 338</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 277 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Presumption of Continuance.
   
   - Once acquired, the homestead is presumed to continue. Williams v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 338</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 277 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The only way property may lose its homestead character,
   
   after the homestead has been allotted, is by death, abandonment or alienation. Williams v. Johnson, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 338</cite>, 53 S.E.2d 277 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Homestead interest in land is terminated by the owner's removal from the State.
   
   S.D. Scott &amp; Co. v. Jones, <cite class="nc_code">230 N.C. 74</cite>, 52 S.E.2d 219 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to the homestead exemption is not forfeited by a fraudulent conveyance,
   
   and a judgment was properly modified by order directing that defendant be allotted his homestead in the land, which should be exempt from sale by the commissioner. New Amsterdam Cas. Co. v. Dunn, <cite class="nc_code">209 N.C. 736</cite>, 184 S.E. 488 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption Allowed in Mortgaged Lands.
   
   - A debtor may have his homestead exemption allotted in lands owned by him but mortgaged to a third person, but in ascertaining the value thereof the mortgage debt should be disregarded, and the land appraised as though the debtor owned the unencumbered fee. Crow v. Morgan, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 153</cite>, 185 S.E. 668 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption in Vacant Lots.
   
   - Where the only real property owned by a judgment debtor consists of vacant lots, he may claim his homestead therein, since he may thereafter build an habitable structure thereon. Equitable Life Assurance Soc'y v. Russos, <cite class="nc_code">210 N.C. 121</cite>, 185 S.E. 632 (1936).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         Doctrine of estoppel cannot deny a bankrupt his right to a homestead
        </b>
        in lands which were subject to his debts. In selecting the land for his homestead exemption, he is not restricted to the tract on which he lives. In re Hamrick, 56 F.2d 240 (W.D.N.C. 1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of Homestead Right.
   
   - The right to claim homestead may be lost by failure to assert it in apt time, by waiver, or by estoppel. Cameron v. McDonald, <cite class="nc_code">216 N.C. 712</cite>, 6 S.E.2d 497 (1940).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Involuntary Absence Did Not Constitute Abandonment of Residence.
   
   - Claimed homestead exemption was allowed, pursuant to <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001C.html#t1Ca16s1C-1601ol1a1" target="_blank">G.S. 1C-1601(a)(1)</a></cite>, over a trustee's objection because the debtor was forced to vacate and did not voluntarily abandon her damaged home as a result of hurricanes and she paid property taxes, stored personalty there, lived in temporary housing, and intended to use the home as a residence as soon as repairs were practicable. In re Foster, 348 B.R. 58 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 2006).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver Shown.
   
   - A written request by judgment debtors to the sheriff to sell lands under execution without the allotment of homestead, to the end that the property might bring the highest price possible, and joinder of the judgment debtors in the sheriff's deed to the purchaser, constituted an authorization and ratification of the act of the sheriff in making the execution sale without allotment of homestead and was a valid waiver by the judgment debtors of their homestead exemption in regard to that particular execution. North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 26</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 30 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendants made no objection to the sale of real property under execution without allotting the homestead until five months after the sale was completed, where the real property was sold to third parties in the meantime, and where the femme defendant was present at the sale and did not request the allotment of a homestead, these facts constituted a waiver by the defendants of their right to have the homestead allotted. North Carolina Nat'l Bank v. Sharpe, <cite class="nc_code">49 N.C. App.</cite> 687, 272 S.E.2d 368 (1980), appeal dismissed, <cite class="nc_code">302 N.C. 217</cite>, 276 S.E.2d 916 (1981).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Creditors Without Standing to Complain of Waiver.
   
   - Homestead is a right created for the benefit of the judgment debtor, and therefore other judgment creditors cannot complain of a waiver by the debtor of this right in designated realty as to a particular judgment. North Carolina Joint Stock Land Bank v. Bland, <cite class="nc_code">231 N.C. 26</cite>, 56 S.E.2d 30 (1949).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Right May Be Sold or Assigned.
   
   - The homestead right or estate is salable or assignable, and the purchaser can hold the land to which it pertains to the exclusion of judgment creditors during its existence. Gardner v. Batts, <cite class="nc_code">114 N.C. 496</cite>, 19 S.E. 794 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        The owner of lands loses his right to a homestead therein allowed by this section upon his conveying the title to the same, by deed, though he may select a homestead thereafter in other of his lands. Duplin County v. Harrell, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 445</cite>, 142 S.E. 481 (1928).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Allotment Unnecessary.
   
   - The title to the homestead is vested in the owner by the Constitution of this State, and no allotment by the sheriff is necessary to vest the title thereto. The allotment by the sheriff is only for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is an excess of property over the homestead which is subject to execution. Lambert v. Kinnery, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 348</cite> (1876).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Land must be selected by the owner and allotted before it becomes exempt.
   
   It must also be both owned and occupied by the homesteader, and this at the time of issuance of the execution. Chadbourn Sash, Door &amp; Blind Co. v. Parker, <cite class="nc_code">153 N.C. 130</cite>, 69 S.E. 1 (1910).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a judgment debtor is present when his homestead in his land is laid off
   
   to him by the appraisers, and he designates the land he desires for the purpose, he may not successfully contend thereafter that other lands should have been included, it not being contended that the value of the homestead as allotted was less than $1,000.00. Citizens Bank v. Robinson, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 796</cite>, 161 S.E. 487 (1931).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a mortgage on land is foreclosed
   
   and the land brings at the foreclosure sale a sum more than sufficient to pay the mortgage debt, the surplus remaining to the constitutional limit of $1,000.00 is to be regarded as realty to which the homestead right attaches when the same has not been waived. Farris v. Hendricks, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 439</cite>, 146 S.E. 73 (1929).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A mortgagor of lands is entitled to his homestead exemption in his equity of redemption
   
   as against the liens of judgment creditors, and an injunction will lie against the sale of the property under execution when his homestead has not been allotted. Cheek v. Walden, <cite class="nc_code">195 N.C. 752</cite>, 143 S.E. 465 (1928).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no lien for purchase money
   
   in North Carolina, and while the judgment debtor cannot claim homestead as against a judgment for purchase money, the lien of a mortgage executed to a third person has priority over the judgment lien, when the mortgage is executed prior to the rendition of the judgment and prior to an amendment putting the title to the property in issue. Jarrett v. Holland, <cite class="nc_code">213 N.C. 428</cite>, 196 S.E. 314 (1938).
   <br />
       </p>
       <p>
        A duly docketed judgment
   
   is a lien on the lands of the judgment debtor, but is subject to the homestead interest in the lands as provided by this section. Farris v. Hendricks, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 439</cite>, 146 S.E. 73 (1929).

       Definition of Terms.
   
   - A "laborer's lien" is solely for labor performed, while a "mechanic's lien" is broader and includes the "work done," i.e., the "building built" or superstructure put on the premises. Broyhill v. Gaither, <cite class="nc_code">119 N.C. 443</cite>, 26 S.E. 31 (1896).

       Adequate Lien for Subcontractors and Suppliers of Materials and Labor.
   
   - Appellate court erred in reversing the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the product supplier that found the product supplier was entitled to judgment in the amount specified in its notice of lien sent to the manufacturer; the state constitution and statutory law provided that a materialman was entitled to an adequate lien on the subject matter of the materials supplied, the product supplier sent a notice of lien for a certain amount to the manufacturer after the product supplier became aware that the contractor with whom the manufacturer had contracted was having financial difficulties, and the manufacturer nevertheless paid the contractor, instead of the product supplier, shortly before the contractor went bankrupt.

     <p>
      The real and personal property of any female in this State acquired before marriage, and all property, real and personal, to which she may, after marriage, become in any manner entitled, shall be and remain the sole and separate estate and property of such female, and shall not be liable for any debts, obligations, or engagements of her husband, and may be devised and bequeathed and conveyed by her, subject to such regulations and limitations as the General Assembly may prescribe. Every married woman may exercise powers of attorney conferred upon her by her husband, including the power to execute and acknowledge deeds to property owned by herself and her husband or by her husband.

      <p>
       General Policy of Section.
   
   - This section is intended to emancipate married women and place them, so far as property rights are concerned, on a par with men and femmes sole. McLeod v. Williams, <cite class="nc_code">122 N.C. 451</cite>, 30 S.E. 129 (1898).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no "beneficent provision of the Constitution" which throws additional shackles around women in the management of their separate property. This provision of the Constitution is in exactly the opposite direction, in accordance with the free spirit of the age and with the universal trend of legislation the world over. Its purpose is not to further assimilate married women to the condition of infants, but to make free women of them, to emancipate them from most of the restrictions formerly existing. Strouse v. Cohen, <cite class="nc_code">113 N.C. 349</cite>, 18 S.E. 323 (1893).
      </p>
      <p>
       The historical context of this Article makes clear that wives were simply accorded rights in their property similar to those rights husbands already enjoyed in their own property. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 354 S.E.2d 350 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).

      <p>
       Purpose to Give Wives Same Rights as Husbands.
   
   - The historical context of this Article makes clear that wives were simply accorded rights in their property similar to those rights husbands already enjoyed in their own property. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 354 S.E.2d 350 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Section Subject to Limitation Prescribed by General Assembly.
   
   - Whatever the remedial purpose of this section, it is by its own terms subject to limitations prescribed by the General Assembly, including any statutory classification and distribution of property under the Equitable Distribution Act. Under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.050.html#t50a01s50-20ol1b" target="_blank">G.S. 50-20(b)</a></cite> of that Act, military retirement pay is treated no differently, whether its recipient is male or female. Armstrong v. Armstrong, <cite class="nc_code">85 N.C. App.</cite> 93, 354 S.E.2d 350 (1987), rev'd on other grounds, <cite class="nc_code">322 N.C. 396</cite>, 368 S.E.2d 595 (1988).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Common-Law Rule Changed.
   
   - The common-law rule giving to the husband the actual or potential ownership of the separate choses in action belonging to his wife by reducing them into possession is now changed by this section giving to the wife the sole ownership of her separate estate. Turlington v. Lucas, <cite class="nc_code">186 N.C. 283</cite>, 119 S.E. 366 (1923).
      </p>
      <p>
       By virtue of this section and other provisions, the relation which married women formerly sustained to their husbands has been materially modified. Unity of person in the strict common-law sense no longer exists, and many of the common-law disabilities have been removed. Not only may they contract with each other; a married woman may now sue her husband in contract or in tort. Dorsett v. Dorsett, <cite class="nc_code">183 N.C. 354</cite>, 111 S.E. 541, 23 A.L.R. 15 (1922); Roberts v. Roberts, <cite class="nc_code">185 N.C. 566</cite>, 118 S.E. 9, 29 A.L.R. 1479 (1923); Etheredge v. Cochran, <cite class="nc_code">196 N.C. 681</cite>, 146 S.E. 711 (1929); Shirley v. Ayers, <cite class="nc_code">201 N.C. 51</cite>, 158 S.E. 840 (1931).
      </p>
      <p>
       This section completely abolished the general doctrine of the common law that as to property husband and wife are in legal contemplation but one person, and that the husband is that one, and made very material and far-reaching changes as to the rights respectively of husband and wife in respect to the wife's property, both real and personal, and enlarged the wife's power in respect to and control over her property. Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 590 (1962), commented on in 91 N.C.L. Rev. 311 (1963).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Purpose of 1964 Amendment.
   
   - The 1964 amendment to this section was enacted to abrogate the effect of the decision in Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 590 (1962) and to make the rights of husbands and wives the same in each other's separate property. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).

       Statutes allowing husband to dissent from wife's will violated section prior to 1964 amendment.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Wife Could Bar Husband's Curtesy by Devising Property.
   
   - By marriage, before the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, the husband acquired no vested rights in the lands of his wife before a child was born capable of inheriting; and when the first child of the marriage was born after the adoption of the Constitution of 1868, which gave a married woman the power, among other things, of disposing, by will, of her property acquired before marriage, she could accordingly dispose of it by will and deprive her husband of his interest therein as tenant by the curtesy. Richardson v. Richardson, <cite class="nc_code">150 N.C. 549</cite>, 64 S.E. 510 (1909).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the Constitution of 1868 there was no curtesy after the death of the wife
   
   in property which she had devised. Tiddy v. Graves, <cite class="nc_code">127 N.C. 502</cite>, 37 S.E. 513 (1900); Dudley v. Staton, <cite class="nc_code">257 N.C. 572</cite>, 126 S.E.2d 590 (1962), comment on in 41 N.C.L. Rev. 311 (1963).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common-law estate of the husband as tenant by the curtesy initiate in the lands of his wife was abolished by Art. X,

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Amendment of 1964 Restored Husband's Right to Dissent.
   
   - The effect of the adoption by the voters of the 1964 amendment to this section was to restore, subject to the qualifications set forth in Session Laws 1963, c. 1209, the right of the husband to dissent from the will of his wife. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Dissent Could Be Based on Anticipatory Legislation Prior to Amendment.
   
   - Where, at the time of his wife's death in 1965, the amendment to this section authorizing the legislature to empower a husband to dissent from his wife's will had been certified but the legislation reenacting former <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.030.html#t30a01s30-1" target="_blank">G.S. 30-1</a></cite>, 30-2, and 30-3 had not become effective, the husband had a right to dissent from his wife's will based on anticipatory provisions of Session Laws 1963, c. 1209, which directed the submission of the constitutional amendment, and which provided that the word "spouse" should apply to both husband and wife in certain statutes. Fullam v. Brock, <cite class="nc_code">271 N.C. 145</cite>, 155 S.E.2d 737 (1967).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Legislative Control Over Capacity to Make Will.
   
   - This section, conferring upon married women the right to make a will, etc., was designed chiefly to remove the common-law restriction on married women in this respect, and was not intended to free such right from every and all legislative regulation. Flanner v. Flanner, <cite class="nc_code">160 N.C. 126</cite>, 75 S.E. 936 (1912).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust for sole use and benefit of married woman
   
   held passive, in view of this section. Pilkington v. West, <cite class="nc_code">246 N.C. 575</cite>, 99 S.E.2d 798 (1957).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Devise of Equitable Separate Estate.
   
   - A married woman may devise her equitable separate estate, in the absence of contrary provisions in the instrument creating it, where the trustee is a passive trustee; and, whether the trust be passive or active, where the trust is to terminate with her life, and the estate to become absolute thereafter. Freeman v. Lide, <cite class="nc_code">176 N.C. 434</cite>, 97 S.E. 402 (1918).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Provisions of Instrument Creating Estate Still Control.
   
   - Married women have no greater estates, by operation of this section of the Constitution, than those conveyed by the terms of the deed under which they derive title; nor are the properties and incidents belonging to estates changed by that instrument. Long v. Barnes, <cite class="nc_code">87 N.C. 329</cite> (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution imposes no limitation upon the right of a grantor or devisor to restrict or enlarge, by the terms of the instrument through which title passes, married woman's jus disponendi. Kirby v. Boyette, <cite class="nc_code">118 N.C. 244</cite>, 24 S.E. 18 (1896).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Marriage Does Not Sever Unity of Title and Possession Under Joint Tenancy.
   
   - Where a deed of bargain and sale conveys a joint tenancy in the grantees with right of survivorship, the subsequent marriage of one of the grantees does not sever the unity of title and possession. Vettori v. Fay, <cite class="nc_code">262 N.C. 481</cite>, 137 S.E.2d 810 (1964).
   <br />
      </p>

       Estates by entireties are not changed or affected by this section.

   - Estates by entireties as between husband and wife still exist in North Carolina, but where there is a judgment upon a joint contract against husband and wife, a lien thereunder is created against lands held by them in entireties, and execution may be issued against them. Martin v. Lewis, <cite class="nc_code">187 N.C. 473</cite>, 122 S.E. 180 (1924).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conveyance of Land Held by Entireties.
   
   - The husband has the right, during coverture, to deal with the possession of land held by him and his wife by entireties without the consent of the wife, but neither may make a contract affecting title so as to defeat the right of the survivor in the whole estate without the consent of the other. Moore v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 446</cite>, 181 S.E. 275 (1935).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where lots are conveyed with restrictive covenants limiting buildings to residences, and one of such lots is owned by husband and wife by the entireties, husband may not convey or contract in respect to the negative easement of such lot over the other lots without the consent of his wife, since the wife has the right to such negative easement as a part of the estate if she should survive her husband. Moore v. Shore, <cite class="nc_code">208 N.C. 446</cite>, 181 S.E. 275 (1935).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conveyances Between Husband and Wife.
   
   - While a deed executed by husband to wife in 1841, even if a fee simple deed, would have been void in law, and sustainable in equity only upon meritorious consideration, it is otherwise as to such deed executed now, which is rendered valid under this section. McLamb v. McPhail, <cite class="nc_code">126 N.C. 218</cite>, 35 S.E. 426 (1900).

      <p>
       Liability of Husband for Rents Paid Wife After Foreclosure.
   
   - Where lands belonging to the separate estate of a wife were foreclosed under a deed of trust thereon duly executed, and after such foreclosure the rents from the land were paid to the wife, the husband could not be held responsible for such rents by the person entitled thereto by virtue of the foreclosure, since under this section a wife is given sole ownership of her separate estate. In re Longley, <cite class="nc_code">205 N.C. 488</cite>, 171 S.E. 788 (1933).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Liability of Wife as Surety to Husband.
   
   - This section, providing that the separate property of the wife shall not be liable for the debts of the husband, has no application to the obligation of the wife as surety of her husband, such obligation being regarded as a direct one between the creditor and herself. Royal v. Southerland, <cite class="nc_code">168 N.C. 405</cite>, 84 S.E. 708 (1915).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Action for Tort to Spouse.
   
   - Husband cannot sue to recover his wife's earnings or damages for torts committed on her, and there is no reason why wife can sue for torts or injuries inflicted on her husband. The law has never authorized the wife to maintain such action for torts sustained by the husband. If the husband could maintain an action to recover damages for torts on his wife, she would be able to maintain an action on account of torts sustained by her husband. Such right of action, if it existed in favor of the husband, should exist in favor of the wife. It should be in favor of both, or neither, but in view of the Constitution of 1868 and the statute on the subject, such action cannot be maintained by either on account of the injury to the other. Hipp v. E.L. Dupont de Nemours &amp; Co., <cite class="nc_code">182 N.C. 9</cite>, 108 S.E. 318 (1921).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Tort Action Against Spouse.
   
   - The right of a married woman to maintain an action against her husband to recover for negligent injury is not limited to residents of this State, but a nonresident wife may maintain an action here against her nonresident husband on a transitory cause of action which arises in this State, and she is entitled to any recovery as her separate property. Bogen v. Bogen, <cite class="nc_code">219 N.C. 51</cite>, 12 S.E.2d 649 (1941).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Power to Contract.
   
   - Contention that when the Constitution gave married women separate estates in their property, it gave them by necessary implication an unrestricted dominion over the property, to bind it directly or indirectly, except when expressly forbidden, and an unrestricted right to contract, such as a feme sole or a man has, would be rejected on grounds that no such grant was implied, that the terms "sole and separate estate" had a known and definite meaning in the law when the Constitution was framed, and that it would be taken that they were used in that instrument in the sense which had been affixed to them by prior decisions of the court. Pippen v. Wesson, <cite class="nc_code">74 N.C. 437</cite> (1876). But see now <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.052.html#t52s52-2" target="_blank">G.S. 52-2</a></cite>.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person may insure his or her own life for the sole use and benefit of his or her spouse or children or both, and upon his or her death the proceeds from the insurance shall be paid to or for the benefit of the spouse or children or both, or to a guardian, free from all claims of the representatives or creditors of the insured or his or her estate. Any insurance policy which insures the life of a person for the sole use and benefit of that person's spouse or children or both shall not be subject to the claims of creditors of the insured during his or her lifetime, whether or not the policy reserves to the insured during his or her lifetime any or all rights provided for by the policy and whether or not the policy proceeds are payable to the estate of the insured in the event the beneficiary or beneficiaries predecease the insured.

       Purpose.
   
   - The purpose of this section is to enable the husband (spouse) to make valuable provision for his wife (spouse) and children after his death, above, beyond and unaffected by his estate, personal and real, and the conditions of the same remaining at the time of his death. Burwell v. Snow, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 82</cite>, 11 S.E. 1090 (1890).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain Insurance Proceeds Not Part of Insured's Estate.
   
   - Where a life insurance policy is issued to an individual in the name and for the benefit of the wife (spouse) and children, it does not upon his death become a part of his estate. Burton v. Farinholt, <cite class="nc_code">86 N.C. 260</cite> (1882).
      </p>
      <p>
       Under this section the proceeds from insurance policy payable to the wife (spouse) and children are not a part of the insured's estate so that they may be claimed by an heir or next of kin. Burwell v. Snow, <cite class="nc_code">107 N.C. 82</cite>, 11 S.E. 1090 (1890).
      </p>
      <p>
       Wives (spouses) and children of bankrupts are protected from claims of the bankrupt's creditors, both during his life and at his death, if life insurance policies are for their sole benefit. In re Wolfe, 249 F. Supp. 784 (M.D.N.C. 1966), commented on in 45 N.C.L. Rev. 696 (1967).
      </p>
      <p>
       Protection Is Personal to Survivors.
   
   - This section clearly looks to provision for the wife (spouse) and children so that they may not be left destitute by the death of an insolvent husband and father (spouse and parent) and is personal to them when they survive. Hooker v. Sugg, <cite class="nc_code">102 N.C. 115</cite>, 8 S.E. 919 (1889).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Cash Surrender Value of Whole Life Insurance Policy Not Exempt.
   
   - Cash surrender value of a whole life insurance policy a debtor owned at the time he declared <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.007.html" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a></cite> bankruptcy was not exempt from creditors' claims under N.C. Const., Art. X,

   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5 treated the policy as a whole unit, and the debtor was not allowed under
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5 to claim that seventy-five percent of the cash surrender value was exempt from creditors' claim because
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5 protected his children's interests. In re Forgione, - Bankr. - (Bankr. M.D.N.C. Sept. 12, 2014).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Exemption of Cash Value Allowed.
       </b>
       - Debtors could exempt the cash value in their life insurance policies as the beneficiaries were testamentary trusts in favor of the other spouse (S) and then their son and the testamentary trustees' (TT) abilities to compromise claims, to use trust funds to make loans to and buy property from S's executors or trustees and to pay agents and professionals was restricted to the sole use and benefit of S and the son and did not allow the TTs to compromise claims against the insureds; the wills directed the TTs to expend income and principal for the health, maintenance and support of S and then to their son, which was close enough to restricting the TTs' abilities to apply the insurance funds to the sole use and benefit of the beneficiaries. In re Foley, - Bankr. - (Bankr. W.D.N.C. Sept. 7, 2016).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Treatment of Insurance Proceeds When Received by Beneficiary.
       </b>
       - Upon filing a bankruptcy petition, a debtor can claim as exempt the value of life insurance policy. There is no provision, however, that extends the protection of the life insurance exemption to the beneficiary of the policy once the proceeds are in the beneficiary's hands. The proceeds are treated like any other asset of the beneficiary and are available to his creditors, except to the extent that an exemption or other protection is available to the beneficiary in his own right under applicable law. The result is no different where the beneficiary is the codebtor of the insured in a joint bankruptcy case. Butler v. Sharik, 41 Bankr. 388 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1984).
      </p>
      <p>
       Where debtor wife died and debtor husband received life insurance proceeds prior to completion of their <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.013.html" target="_blank">Chapter 13</a></cite> plan, trustee's motion to modify their plan to require debtor husband to pay a lump sum sufficient to pay allowed unsecured debts that were either joint debts or in debtor's name only was granted. Trustee did not seek to pay debtor wife's debts with the proceeds because under North Carolina law, those proceeds were paid to the beneficiaries free from all claims of her creditors. In re Evans, - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Jan. 5, 2015).

       <b>
        Trust Authorizing Payment to Decedent's Unsecured Creditors.
       </b>
       - Providing for one's spouse, children, or both through a trust as beneficiary of a life insurance policy does not in and of itself categorically violate the terms of N.C. Const., Art. X,
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       5, so long as the trust complies with the purposes underlying the exemption. However, where a trust authorizes payments to the unsecured creditors of the decedent, who would otherwise have been barred from accessing such funds by the protection offered under
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       5, such a trust exceeds the boundaries of "sole use and benefit" contemplated by that provision. In re Foster, - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Nov. 1, 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
       Life insurance policies were not exempt under <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.001C.html#t1Ca16s1C-1601ol1a6" target="_blank">G.S. 1C-1601(a)(6)</a></cite> and N.C. Const., Art. X,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   5, because the trust that was the beneficiary of the policies authorized the trustee to make payments to the unsecured creditors of the decedent from the insurance proceeds. In re Foster, - Bankr. - (Bankr. E.D.N.C. Nov. 1, 2011).

      <p>
       <b>
        Trust Referencing Only "Claims Against the Estate."
       </b>
       - In the instant case, the trust did not distinguish between types of creditors and instead references only "claims against the estate," but this was more than enough to illustrate that the proceeds were not "for the sole use and benefit of (the policy owner's) spouse or children or both," such that the exemption was not applicable.

      <p>
       The courts may impose only such punishments as are authorized
   
   by this section. State v. Cole, <cite class="nc_code">241 N.C. 576</cite>, 86 S.E.2d 203 (1955).
   <br />

      <p>
       Section Limits Remedial Creativity.
   
   - This provision, in effect since 1868, was intended to stop the use of degrading punishments theretofore inflicted, but as a necessary consequence it also limited the creativity of trial judges in fashioning remedies for crime. Shore v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 628</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 553 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Conditional Suspension of Punishment.
   
   - As a consequence of the desire for more diverse responses to criminal behavior, the practice developed to suspend a constitutionally designated punishment with the consent of defendant upon his performance of conditions. And so long as these conditions are otherwise constitutional, related to the purposes of punishment, and otherwise reasonable they need not be limited to the type of punishment prescribed by this provision. Shore v. Edmisten, <cite class="nc_code">290 N.C. 628</cite>, 227 S.E.2d 553 (1976).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution forbids both ignominious burial and forfeiture of estates
   
   as punishment for crime. State v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 473</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 854 (1961).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Fines as Constitutional Punishment.
   
   - Fines are a pecuniary punishment extracted by the State.
   They are a permitted form of punishment under the state constitution. Florence v. Hiatt, <cite class="nc_code">101 N.C. App.</cite> 539, 400 S.E.2d 118 (1991).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       No contact with victims.
   
   - Sentence provision which precluded defendant from having any contact with the victims did not violate N.C. Const., Art. XI,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1, as the no contact recommendation was not a mandatory and binding part of the judgment, but rather, much like an order of restitution; furthermore, it constituted a recommendation to the Secretary of the Department of Correction and the Parole Commission, not an order binding defendant upon entry of the judgment, as neither the Parole Commission nor the Department of Correction was bound by the judge's recommendation. State v. Curmon, <cite class="nc_code">171 N.C. App.</cite> 697, 615 S.E.2d 417 (2005).
      </p>
      <p>
       G.S 15A-1340.50, pursuant to which a trial court permanently ordered defendant to have no contact with the victim of defendant's sexual offenses, did not violate the limitations on punishments in N.C. Const., Art. XI,
   <span class="s1">
    §
   </span>
   1 because the statute imposed a civil remedy, as (1) the legislature intended, in the statute, to impose a civil regulatory scheme to protect a citizen who was victimized and in fear of further contact from defendant, and (2) no punitive purpose or effect negated that intent, as the statute's limited application and possibly limited duration showed the statute's reasonableness. State v. Hunt, <cite class="nc_code">221 N.C. App.</cite> 48, 727 S.E.2d 584 (2012).

       Suicide may not be punished in North Carolina.

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal character of the act of suicide is not changed.
   
   State v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 473</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 854 (1961).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Constitution and statutes have repealed and abrogated the common law as to suicide only as to punishment and possibly the quality of the offense. State v. Willis, <cite class="nc_code">255 N.C. 473</cite>, 121 S.E.2d 854 (1961).

       Authority to Establish Prison System.
   
   - Under the provisions of this Article, the General Assembly has plenary authority to provide for a State prison system. Pharr v. Garibaldi, <cite class="nc_code">252 N.C. 803</cite>, 115 S.E.2d 18 (1960).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       This section has no direct application to the discipline required in jails and penitentiaries,
   
   for if so it would prevent solitary confinement, restriction of rations, and other reasonable punishments that are in customary use in prisons and penitentiaries. State v. Nipper, <cite class="nc_code">166 N.C. 272</cite>, 81 S.E. 164 (1914).

   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Regulations Governing Prisoners Must Be Reasonable.
   
   - Whether prisoners are worked on the public road or kept in jail, the regulations under which they must live must be reasonable. State v. Young, <cite class="nc_code">138 N.C. 571</cite>, 50 S.E. 213 (1905).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Right and Duty of Prosecuting Attorney to Seek Death Penalty.
   
   - Where the grand jury, after investigation according to law, indicted defendant for murder in the first degree, and prosecuting attorney, after investigation, determined, on behalf of the State, that defendant should be tried for this offense, and that the death penalty should be sought, these determinations having been made on behalf of the State, it was the right and duty of the prosecuting attorney, vigorously, but fairly and in accordance with law, both in the presentation of evidence and in his argument, to seek that result. State v. Westbrook, <cite class="nc_code">279 N.C. 18</cite>, 181 S.E.2d 572 (1971), death sentence vacated, 408 U.S. 939, 92 S. Ct. 2873, 33 L. Ed. 2d 761 (1972).

       The term "life imprisonment without parole"
   
   falls within the meaning of the constitutional term "imprisonment," so the sentence was authorized by the Constitution. State v. Allen, <cite class="nc_code">346 N.C. 731</cite>, 488 S.E.2d 188 (1997).

       Duty of State to Furnish Medical Care to Indigent Sick.

       Delegation of Duty to Counties.
   
   - In accordance with the express constitutional declaration of this section, the care of the indigent sick and afflicted poor is a proper function of the State government, and the General Assembly may by statute require the counties, as administrative agencies of the State, to perform this function, at least within their territorial limits.

       The General Assembly may by statute delegate a portion of its sovereignty to the governing body of any town or city or county, separately or jointly, who, when they deem it for the best interest of the town or city or county, may contract with hospitals for the medical treatment and hospitalization of the sick and afflicted poor of the town or city or county within their territorial limits.

       Governor May Call Out Militia.
   
   - In the absence of legislation, the Governor, as commander-in-chief, has the power to call out the militia, and the State guard being made a part of the militia, he has the power to call them out. This constitutional power may be regulated by legislation providing what shall amount to sufficient evidence of the existence of the causes mentioned in this section. Worth v.

Delegates to the Convention shall be elected by the qualified voters at the time and in the manner prescribed in the act of submission. The Convention shall consist of a number of delegates equal to the membership of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly that submits the convention proposition and the delegates shall be apportioned as is the House of Representatives. A Convention shall adopt no ordinance not necessary to the purpose for which the Convention has been called.

        Judiciary Cannot Strip Legislative Branch of Constitutional Power to Propose Amendments to Constitution.
       </b>
       - Superior court erred in declaring that the members of the General Assembly duly elected in 2016 lacked authority to pass bills proposing amendments to the state constitution for the people's consideration based on the fact that certain members were elected from illegally gerrymandered districts because nothing in the appellate court's jurisprudence suggested that the judiciary could unilaterally strip the legislative branch of some of its constitutional powers. It was simply beyond the appellate court's power to thwart the otherwise lawful exercise of constitutional power by the legislative branch to pass bills proposing amendments; thus, the challenged constitutional amendments duly ratified by the people were valid.

      Ambulatory Seaward Boundary Consistent with Constitution.
   
   - While a proposal to permanently fix the seaward boundary for the State at specific coordinates would violate both <cite class="octn"><a href="gov.nc.stat.title.141.html#t141s141-6ol1a" target="_blank">G.S. 141-6(a)</a></cite>, and this section, the acceptance of an ambulatory boundary, which merely represents the seaward boundary's location at a certain time, and moves with changes to the shoreline, whether by erosion, accretion or fill deposition, would be consistent with the Constitution and not require amendment of the statute; a reading of the State constitutional provision together with the statute and the case law reveal them to require that the eastern boundary always remain at distance of three geographical miles from the extreme low water mark.

      <p>
       What Is a General Law.
   
   - A general law defines a class which reasonably warrants special legislative attention and applies uniformly to everyone in the class. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
      </p>
      <p>
       A law is general if any rational basis reasonably related to the objective of the legislation can be identified which justifies the separation of units of local government into included and excluded categories. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       What Is a Local Act.
   
   - A local act unreasonably singles out a class for special legislative attention or, having made a reasonable classification, does not apply uniformly to all members of the designated class. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The constitutional prohibition against local acts
   
   simply commands that when legislating in certain specified fields the General Assembly must make rational distinctions among units of local government which are reasonably related to the purpose of the legislation. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       Distinguishing Between General and Local Acts.
   
   - The distinguishing factors between a valid general law and a prohibited local act are the related elements of reasonable classification and uniform application. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).
   <br />
      </p>
      <p>
       The mere fact that a statute applies only to certain units of local government
   
   does not by itself render the statute a prohibited local act. Only if the statutory classification is unreasonable or under-inclusive will the statute be voided as a prohibited local act. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

       Classification does not render a statute "local" if the classification is reasonable

       Regulation Need Not Reach Every Conceivable Class.
   
   - There is no constitutional requirement that a regulation, in other respects permissible, must reach every class to which it might be applied, i.e., that the legislature must be held rigidly to the choice of regulating all or none. It is enough that the present statute strikes at the evil where it is felt, and reaches the class of cases where it most frequently occurs. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

       While substantial distinctions are essential in classification, the distinctions need not be scientific
   
   or exact. The legislature has wide discretion in making classifications. Adams v. North Carolina Dep't of Natural &amp; Economic Resources, <cite class="nc_code">295 N.C. 683</cite>, 249 S.E.2d 402 (1978).

       Public Trust Rights.
   
   - It was error to grant a town judgment notwithstanding a verdict in a condemnation case on a theory that the public trust doctrine made the taking noncompensable because (1) the theory was not raised on directed verdict, (2) the sua sponte order was entered months after final judgment, and (3) the town was estopped from asserting the town possessed rights taken as the town's complaint said the town did not, the town did not raise the issue at an "all other issues" hearing, at which the town disavowed the public trust doctrine, the town did not immediately appeal a vital ruling that the town condemned the property, and landowners introduced a scintilla of supporting evidence.
